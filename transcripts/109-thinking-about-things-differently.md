From RelayFM, you're listening to Conduit, the show where we condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that is here at the time that we were definitely scheduled and not messing up your mental brain by doing it early.
Hi, I'm Kathy and with me today, as almost always, is my co-host Jay. Hi, Jay. Most of the time, I'm here all the time. Nice. 70% of the time, it works 30% of the time, every time. Something like that.
Yeah, so as I alluded to in the intro, this is coming to your podcast app of choice a little bit earlier than normal. As we discussed before, and if this is your first episode, hi, welcome to Conduit. We're so happy you're here.
But we definitely are a fortnightly show, and we were looking at our fall schedule and realized that we would basically not be recording an episode together until December, I think. It was something like that. Something bananas.
However, however, if we switched the weeks that we were recording, we'd be fine. So that's what we did, because we are in charge of our own lives, and we didn't have any sponsors. So that worked out pretty well. So we're swapping this now.
We shouldn't have to change it again, but who knows? I'm not going to say that. It has been. This is our 109th episode. And you know what? We like to switch things up. Let's change things up. Let's think a little differently, you know, outside of the box.
I'm not here to make Carrie's job harder, but I just want to throw out there. At this point, if anybody wants to sponsor us, there's two choices. One, go to imasuperconductor.com, letter I, letter M, letter A, superconductor.com, and just sign up and just join.
Then you can, you are personally sponsoring us, and we will thank you and love you for that.
The other option is, you know what? If you want to give us more than what's on there to sign up to become a member, I will personally see to it that we read whatever it is you want us to read, as long as Carrie approves it. Wow. So, like, yeah, it could be, like, a dollar more.
And, like, if you want me to give you a 30-second ad read about something fun, I will do it. Yeah. I will do it. We have people in the chat now that are like, wait, don't tempt me. And I'm like, yes, yes. You know what? You know what? We've tried the company ways.
If you want me to lie, you're going to mess with my ethics. Laura in the chat is wanting me to talk about how great Disney and themes are. I mean, I have. And compliment me. I have good taste in Disney movies. There are, like, three or four that I enjoy. It's just the rest are deplorable.
So, like, we could make that work. Complimenting Kathy. I compliment Kathy all the time. I know. Kathy is showered with compliments. This is it. So, like, yeah, like I said, if anybody wants to be a sponsor, for a dollar more. No, no.
We got to ask more than that just because of the invoicing structure of things. Email, what is it, sponsorships at relay.fm. Or, you know what? Email Kathy at relay.fm because I feel like this will need a direct conversation with Carrie instead of just an open source. Yeah.
Like, throw it out there. So, yeah. Yeah. We'll do that. Yep. That sounds great. Definitely. The reason why I'm doing that will make more sense as we get into the main topic. Mm-hmm. But, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm sending the shout-out. This week was sponsored by nobody.
It could have been sponsored by you. Oh, it's like those billboards that are like, hey, this billboard isn't sponsoring anything, but it could be sponsoring you. All you have to do is call this number. Yep. Yep. I love it.
Well, and we also had a lot of fun in the Discord in the past week, specifically because it's basically September. As we are recording this, tomorrow is August 27th, and spoiler alert, we are launching the St. Jude campaign tomorrow. Oh, snap. Oh, snap. Yep. Which is exciting.
And I'm definitely not nervous this year. The chaos is going to be, like, amazing. But I'm excited. I'm excited to see what this year brings. And along that, we also need some ideas for our live stream, our conduit stream. Whoa. Matt Van Ormer. Dr.
Matt coming in with some brand new, like, information. Live and active. We're going to pause this live show right now. What happened? Because Taylor Swift is now engaged. Oh. I know. It's, like, it's fine. I was. You don't care. Okay, Kathy, here's the thing.
You were just talking about all of the, like, St. Jude, like, important stuff. Yes. Like, you were talking about how St. Jude, we're launching the stuff for St. Jude tomorrow. Yeah. And I was like, this is great. This is amazing. I'm super excited. And then you were like, hold on. Stop the presses.
I have some useless information to share with you. Yes. Yes. But, like, it was brand new. And I, see, look, I sent it to Erica. I genuinely thought that we were getting, like, oh, and by the way, did we say tomorrow, I mean, today, here's the copy for the St. Jude read or something. No.
That was pure. I was so excited. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay, good. Laura cares, too. People of the internet, what you have to understand is, there are very few things that me as a Tennessean, a born and bred, orange-bleeding Tennessean, like, we don't get excited about a lot.
Barbecue, we get excited about that. College football, college sports in general, we get really excited about that. The only other thing that we get excited about is anything happening with St. Jude, because we understand that St. Jude is our biggest export. Yes. Yes.
And there are some incredible things that are happening. We're very excited for what is coming down the pipe, but I can't give any treats or sneak peeks, other than the fact that, because this has been public, I'm going to be in a little emoji pixel thing this year, and I'm very excited.
And I'm trying to decide if I wear, because I have an outfit that matches my little character now, and I'm trying to decide, do I, A, wear it for the photo shoot that we have, so it matches the thing, B, wear it as one of the outfits on the stream, or C, both? Mmm.
I mean, I'm always going to say, but like, you do you. I know. So that's what I'm sitting with. That is what I am trying to figure out right now, what I want to do with that. So that's exciting.
But yeah, we have some other plans, too, that Mike and Steven don't know about, that will bring some delightful chaos, but it's going to be a good show. We've started our meetings, and it's going to be great. It's going to be so much fun.
But also, all of the stuff throughout the year that we're planning is going to be fun. So that's awesome. Go team. Go team. And Laura asks, am I going to have multiple outfits on stream? Of course I am. Absolutely.
We'll see if Erica is going to do the similar bag of all-dress chips for each outfit that I wear, because that would be cool.
Also, how do we feel about possibly wearing stuff from previous years? Like, do we think that's okay? I'm thinking of bringing back, like, my Red Panda overalls, which were really, really comfy. But yeah, this is all future me, future me problems. I was like, we have gone off.
Yeah, we're very off the rails. Maybe your announcement was our one good thing. Oh, yes, absolutely. One good thing. For me, Taylor Swift is engaged. For me, my cat didn't die after getting into my plants. That's good. That's great. Yeah, so there's that.
Yeah, you know, we're shooting for minimal success here. You know what? I'll take it. That is good, especially since another one of my friends had to put their dog down. So, because of plants or as of? No, because of other. Kathy, this is the good thing. I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Good thing.
Yay. Your cat's not dead. Oh, God. Okay. Anyways, let's move on, shall we? It's time to zap a little bit. Time for the connection checks. Jay, how did you do? Okay. So, my connection was to try to play with Raycast a little bit. And I was, at first I was going to say, no, I didn't do this at all.
I really didn't. But what I did instead was, I did, I used Raycast for things that I normally would reach for other tools for. Um, so there was a little bit of like the, oh, hey, I know Raycast can do that. So, let me just do it the Raycast way. Yeah. And just like, let, just see, see if it sticks.
Um, but, I mean, if I'm being honest, I didn't, I didn't like, I didn't push it. I didn't like stretch it. It was more like, oh, I'll add some more snippets in here. Oh, I'll go do it. Like, I'm, I'm just slowly easing my way into it a little bit. Yeah. No, that's good. That's good.
Um, yeah, so I, uh, was able to clean out two kitchen drawers and instead of cheating and like only doing the one that holds, you know, like my aluminum foil and stuff that's like, there's five things in there and it doesn't take a lot to do.
I actually did the two junk drawers in my kitchen that had so many tools in it that A, we never use or B, duplicates. Like I had a hand-me-down meat thermometer that was, I feel like it was my dad's like 30 years ago and I didn't, it doesn't work. Okay.
It'd be one thing if it worked, but it doesn't. Um, I have another meat thermometer that's just the regular basic one that also didn't work consistently. And then I have a really nice one that does work. So guess what? I got rid of the two that don't work, which is fantastic.
And so, yes, I have a big green check mark because I successfully did my connections.
 Uh, and now normally this is where we would go and read our conductors connections, but, uh, as we stated at the top of the show, we are doing things a little bit different because of our cadence and we wanted to make sure that our team had, our, our conductors had time to do and send their connections.
And also it's a really good thing that we did not, um, actually have the conductors because we may or may not have had issues with the bot today.
And, uh, no, uh, it was just being worked on and someone who definitely shall remain nameless, um, and did not, no, not actually nameless, not the nameless of the show. Um, but, uh, they forgot to turn it back on when they were fixing it.
So, it's not on and it can't be until, um, that person gets home from work. So, is that, is that, uh, is that the same person that, nevermind, we're not, we're not going to play it. That, that absolutely destroyed my talking points. Yes, we're not, absolutely.
We're not going to bring any, no, no shame here. You know what? Nope. We, we appreciate you. And, you know, these, these technical mistakes, they happen.
Even I have been there where I've submitted a change and then forgot to actually push the button and then, yeah, sat there wondering why nothing had worked. Yeah, that's always really fun. That's fun. Or, same with like, when you, um, send a very important email and don't hit send.
That's really fun. Yeah, yeah, we love that. We love that. So, yeah, we don't have any conductors connections right now. Uh, instead, we're going to hop straight into our topic, uh, which is time to think different. Now, this has many meanings.
Um, but for us right now, we're kind of going through, both of us are kind of hitting a, an interesting time of life, shall we say. Uh, I'm reworking my business, probably going to be doing some big changes over the next few months. Um, and Jay, what's up with you? Um, not much, honestly.
I'm, I'm, I'm just chilling. Um, no. Uh, did you, oh, did you just aren't talking? Okay. What happened? You, I, hold on. My internet connection is unstable. Why am I unstable? I mean, listen, rude, rude. Don't even go there. I was going there.
I think my, I think the heat is getting to my internet, but I did not hear you. So if you could say it again, uh, well, there was nothing of importance that was said.
So, um, I would, I would think for me, the, the biggest, nothing really for me has officially changed, but yet I'm here wanting change to happen. Um, and that is a big, hmm, that is a, that is a difficult place to be in.
Um, like when we, when we look at, you know, we've, when we look at the last several episodes, we've kind of talked about this. Like, obviously there are the geopolitical frustrations in the world that we wish would change.
There are the, like, Hey, sometimes I just feel like being checked out, which is just a real feeling. Um, at the moment, that's like a mood. Um, there is the, me wanting to think very differently about, not parenting, but, uh, uh, I guess how I parent.
Um, um, then that, that has kind of been a big thing for me. Um, my, my kid and I, uh, took a fun trip to DC. Um, probably not the best time to take a trip to DC, but we did it. Uh, we survived.
And it was one of those moments where like this weird, spontaneous, very expensive, like act of randomness, I think did so much good for, uh, you know, our relationship, uh, just as, you know, dad and dad and kid. Um, yeah.
And then we followed that up with a weekend, you know, trip into the city to go build slime and, and things like that. Um, that was a, that was a fun time. I got slimed for the second time in my life because I am of that generation. I got slimed at university. Was it neon green? No. You did? Yeah.
As a kid, I got slimed at the Nickelodeon set. So jealous. I always wanted to do that. It's two different, like textures of slime. Um, some of the slime they do is like an applesaucey slime. It's literally just applesauce and food coloring.
Um, but then they also have like the, the liquidy like slime stuff that nowadays they make it with glue. Um, yeah. Don't eat that. No, no, no, um, but, but don't eat the applesauce one either. Why not? Because I'm sure the neon green food coloring is not very good for you.
I, I, listen, I'm not a professional, not, not, not a pro, but no, but I feel like that color of things is fairly unnatural. Not that I have any, any, uh, issues with that. Uh, Mike, yes, you can still submit your connection checks if you're not a super conductor. Absolutely. For two weeks.
But we're not doing that because right now is a surprise, not a surprise. We kind of warned ahead of time, but like an extra, an extra week. So we just did no kind of, we're doing no, um, conductor connection checks this episode. Yep. Yep. Yep.
Um, so all of that to say, um, I am trying to have very authentic conversations, um, with, with dads, um, some specifically with dads. Um, I'm not going to say I pitched a dad podcast, um, for relay, but I threw a teaser out there and, and, you know, the fish didn't bite, um, but it's fine.
Are you sure that the teaser was received? Oh yeah. A hundred percent. Cause it was, it was very much like if we were going to do it, it would be specifically this. And they were very much like, no, yes, but I don't want to do a podcast right now.
And I was very much like, I respect that, but also I would want to have these conversations, even if they weren't recorded. Um, which is actually a thing that I have been doing now. I have been actively talking with other like dads about dad anxieties. Um, Oh yeah.
There, there's a lot of things that I will say, whatever, whatever masculine culture, we don't talk about feelings. Um, I think dads have a hard time. Voicing their feelings, their anxieties about being a dad. Yeah. Um, the patriarchy did not just screw up women. Yeah. Yeah.
Well, and I don't even, um, it's, it's hard. It's hard to figure out again. This is like one of the things that like I was, I was telling said person, I have certain, I have very, very specific hangups in my life because what I was taught was I need to prepare my child for when I'm not here.
And just given, given like health issues and other things, I'm, I'm not, I'm not planning on going anywhere. All of my health charts and stuff say that I'm going to be here for a while. So like nobody worry about me.
Um, but there is like that anxiety around, like I, anybody could laugh too hard, fall over, hit their head on something and be gone. Yeah. Or I don't know, have a massive stroke at 27. Exactly. Just throwing that out there. Exactly.
Speaking of which, do you have, uh, documents in place? Do you have a living will? Do you have, um, power of attorney and that sort of stuff set up? Uh, no. Okay. Yes. I know. You do. Okay. Good. Good. Um, I do have, I do have a very healthy life insurance policy. That listen, that's great.
That's great. We love that. We love that. But that does not help if you are in the middle range of situations, like being, you need to discuss your wishes. Yep. Wishes, wishes have been discussed, but they haven't been documented. Yep. Document them. That is, that is the thing.
That should be your connection. Oh, no. Oh, Kathy. I know, but this way it'll actually get happened. Yes, Erica. That's like big snaps for you. She got her will and stuff done last week. Better late than never. Absolutely. Like this is, this needs to happen.
That goes in the same list as like get my veterans benefits. Why did you still? Oh my, oh my God. Jay Miller. Sir. Sir. I knew that was going to go. I knew, I knew that the second I brought it up. Jay. Anyway. So mad at you right now.
Anyway, I'm, I'm saying all of this because I am, I am in a place where, and I think I talked about this at the beginning of the year. I, I was kind of talking about like just accepting, I don't want to say accepting the bougie-ness, I guess.
Um, but accepting that like, I am in a different, I'm in a different place than where I thought I would be in my life. And that's a good thing. Okay.
But also that is making me think differently about future planning, money management, like all of those things in a way that I'm not comfortable with. And, and some of that is stigmatized just by like black culture in America.
There is this thing about like being black in Atlanta means something completely different than being black in the rest of the world. Um, and I have to live with that because there are expectations and all this other stuff that's really stupid, but it's whatever.
Um, there's, there's also like this making space for happy moments in, in life and prioritizing those happy moments. Honestly, above things that other people probably wouldn't. I hope my boss who is brand new, welcome to the company. Um, I hope you don't hear this.
My mental health is more important than my job. Yes. I, I strongly believe that I could get another job faster than I can recover from burnout. Um, and I am genuinely privileged enough to say that, like, I have the connections, I have the things lined up.
I have the people who are already asking me to come and join their team. Like I'm in a place where I can leverage that and take care of me and take care of family and focus on family a little bit more.
Doesn't mean I'm quiet quitting, not focus on the family, which is a James Dobson thing and not RIP to him who just died last week, but continue. Oh, I don't even know what that means, but that's, that's totally fine. You don't need to, but, uh, if you know, you know. Okay.
Um, but yeah, this is, this has really got me thinking about a lot of different things, but also thinking about them. Like before, before I do anything, the, the way that I'm thinking about things has to not fundamentally change, but it has to adjust. Hmm. Yeah. What about you, Kathy? Yeah.
There's a bunch of adjustments that, that need to happen. And a lot of it is not just in the business, but how the business is structured with my life.
We've got a big change happening in one of the businesses that I support, um, through being chief of staff for one of my clients, which it's almost been 10 years. That we've been working together. No, it's more than 10 years that we've been working together. Um, which is absolute bananas.
Um, and so like, we are working through that. And that involves a lot of juggling, shall we say, um, and is taking some priority, but I still have a lot of available time on my docket because I had made changes in the past for the client that no longer I'm working with.
And so a bunch of things are, are up in the air. I might have to actually market my business, which is very weird. Um, I've never really had to do that. It's all been referral based and like talking to people. And that's my favorite part of networking.
And like, actually like running my business is the fact that like, I don't have to do this like blanket. BS stuff, which I don't love. Um, but I don't know how else to do it.
So I gotta, I gotta finalize some of like that and, and kind of think differently about how, like about the services that I'm offering, being able to put examples together or like structural stuff or like better tell people what it is that I do.
Because if I'm talking to people that are not referrals, I have to explain what I do a little bit differently. Like the, the, the terms that I use and, and the structure of, of my conversations are different than people that are like, Hey, I heard from about you from so-and-so.
And so I have to, I have to do that. Um, I also like, I looked at my calendar. I am not going to be home every single Saturday until the middle of October. This isn't like long travel weeks, but I've got birthday parties. I've got weddings. I've got bachelorette parties. I've got podcast-a-thon.
I've got, uh, a cruise. Like all of these things are happening one right after another to the point where I will not be home on a Saturday night for a month and a half. So that, that's fun. And it is fun.
And I'm excited, but also like the added pressure of doing all of the, the changes and the things and, and setting up and making sure nothing gets through the cracks.
Uh, and, uh, so as I mentioned in my systems check last year, my structure of kind of what is going on with how I'm, you know, tracking and, and documenting and, and making sure stuff doesn't get lost is changing a little bit. So my system is changing just a bit.
Um, um, I'm trying to do it in a logical way so that I don't get overwhelmed and, you know, cause nothing's worse than changing everything. And then stuff fails because you've changed it all. And then you can't like catch up in yes, Erica, good stress is still stress. You're right.
And I, I collect stress like bouquets of flowers. In, in vases. Yes. Sorry. I tried to make a light of the situation. I know it's appreciated. It's appreciated. Yeah. Something, something that I thought about, um, and this is, this is a thing that is like processing in my head.
My plants have been dying, Kathy. Oh no. I don't like it. Um, but some of my plants have been thriving and what I have learned literally as of the last like week or so is that I'm not a, I'm not an overwaterer. Underwater. None of that stuff.
It has nothing to do with how much or how little I'm watering my plant. Okay. The situation is that my plant is often in too large of a pot. Hmm. Hmm.
And, and like for, for those that aren't familiar with how plants work, I mean, when it comes to like caring for them, if, if your plant isn't too small of a pot, it becomes what's called root bound. There's not enough soil to absorb moisture for the roots to stay healthy.
These are the roots die and the plant dies. If there's too much soil, then there's not enough roots to absorb the soil or to absorb the moisture in the soil. So the moisture stays wet and becomes a harvesting area for things like mold and fungus, which then causes the roots to rot.
And then the roots fall off and the plant dies. Um, so like in most cases, the thing that will save your plant is having the right amount of soil and the watering and the light and all that thing.
But like the right amount of soil, um, can often be the thing that keeps your plants healthy and thriving. Um, that being said, like it's really hard. Like that's a hard, it's hard to, to figure out like how, how big, like usually you have like a root ball or your ball of roots.
And they say that the pot should be like two, one to two inches larger than whatever that root ball is. But that's sometimes it's hard to think about when you have like something like a pothos, which is like a hanging plant and it's all viney and it wants to dangle and do stuff.
So when you've got like that situation, you got a big, big plant and you want to match like the plant, the pot to the plant, but really the, it needs a smaller, needs a smaller pot. Um, and I'm saying all of this because what I'm, I'm not moving. That's not happening. We're never moving again.
Um, that's been like a big, a big thing, but I, I have been questioning a lot.
I've been questioning myself a lot about like, am I, am I trying to put myself in a pot that is too big?
In some ways, like, and like, again, not to make this preachy or like a book or whatever, but like, am I, am I trying to think of like, Oh, well I'll grow into this or, Oh, this will be, this will be good when I'm at this stage.
And by doing that, what I'm doing is putting myself in a position to where it's like, Oh, actually no, what you're doing is leaving too much, too much around you that will cause problems. And those problems will be unseen because you're too busy focusing on the things that you can focus.
Oh, interesting. Yeah. I had an, Oh man, you're so good at that analogy stuff. I'm just like, just thinking about like the, you, you mentioned like being afraid, not afraid of like hating marketing and things like that. And being so good at the word of mouth stuff and like, okay, cool.
Hey, maybe you're root bound on the word of mouth stuff for, right now. And you can probably still do word of mouth. You just got to increase like slightly, like increase slightly how you're spreading, how you're doing word of mouth.
And, and like, I thought about that in Kathy, do you remember what you were doing when we first started the show? I mean, kind of what I'm doing now. You were going through a year of tech talks. Oh yeah.
And like, I'm sure that that taught you, you know, if anything, it taught you how to be consistent, but like it, it gave you like this level of like comfort and comfortability around doing tech talk stuff. Yeah. Yeah. But also, you know, there's, there's a couple of thoughts here.
One, that's a marketing vehicle. You can still be your fun unicorn self. By the way, I just got your text messages. Yeah. That's okay. I was so confused. Cause like, I was like, what is happening? For the record, for the record.
And we can cut this out of the recording, but I texted Jay to let him know. Cause Ophelia was whining on the chair. And I, so I needed to get her out of the room. And so I was like, Hey, I'm not going to be replying, but clearly it didn't matter. So we're good.
Um, but yeah, like you, you were doing all the tech talk stuff.
 So like maybe there's a way to incorporate like your ability to find trends, find things that you're doing and make them fun, make them the authentic, like Kathy, you know, style, but having the, especially right now, as I know that you have kind of this struggle with like AI and like all AI optimization stuff.
And it's like, Hey, perhaps here's a way that you can leverage that skillset to say, this is why you should hire me. Instead of thinking that AI is going to solve the problem. For you from a capital standpoint, but also using that to get the word out. Like it's still the same type of marketing.
It's still word of mouth. It's just, yeah, your, your group is a little different and it's not you taking out giant marketing campaigns or spending like hundreds or thousands of dollars on like Facebook ads or. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
No, I definitely have thought about utilizing my tech talk more. Um, I have one for the business. Um, and so it's definitely been on my mind. I'm just not a hundred percent sure what that looks like. And that is also okay. So yeah, that's, that's one of the things I'm, I'm looking at. Yeah.
One of the things we'll see. Yeah.
 But, and, and to be fair, the thing that y'all are yelling at me about with like the life planning and the other stuff and the, the VA benefits, a lot of the reason that this stuff has been set to the side is because of feeling root bound in some ways and feeling like there was just so much stuff going on that these are these, are these things that I could get some benefit from?
Yes.
Are they, am I going to get so much benefit from it that it's worth the sacrifice in time? Yes. Which is purely my greatest asset right now. I would argue that. Okay. I hear, here's why, because God forbid something happens. You're going to wish that you did it. And so will your family.
The, the life planning stuff, I will agree. And honestly, that's just been a thing that we just got to sit down, find a life planner, find somebody who's going to be able to go like, here are all the things that you need. Let me get all the papers together and do that. And like, make that happen.
Like that's yes, absolutely. That the VA stuff, like I know what my VA level was. I know what my disability level was when I got out and it's like, am I leaving money on the table? Yes. Is it. Are you leaving money on the table for your child? Yes. Yes. Ish. Because that money is still there.
Right. But. So like, if, if like my child was in college and I was like, I don't know how I would pay for all of this stuff. And then all of a sudden I'm like, oh yeah, that money that I left on the table for my child. Like, yeah. Okay. Then, then yes, absolutely.
Um, again, Lord, please let my mother never hear this because at least twice a year, I get a phone call. That's like, oh, you're going to do your disability stuff. Yeah. Yes. See, if even your mom is doing it, come on, Jay. That's not, she told my sister to rinse with hydrogen peroxide today.
So no, we're not, we're not doing that. We're not. Listen, a stopped clock is right twice a day. All of that to say is I have specifically not done some things that I probably should have done.
And a lot of that was because of the like feeling choked out in time in terms of like, I don't have enough time to do these things. Yeah. But the answer, the answer truly is I need to think about like adjusting the size of the pot that I have. Yeah.
And that, that means, you know, in our case, we're like, we don't get more time. That's not how that works. Right. We have to make more time and making more time often comes with like the, I'm going to do less. And it's funny.
Like I was talking to another person and like technically per hour of like work, I make more money on conduit than I do at my day job. What? It's wild. Cause think about how much time we put into, to conduit. Oh, gotcha. It's like four hours. Like in a, in a poor, per hour.
It's like four, it's like four hours a month, but like four hours a month versus what we're making off of conduit is like, and that's not me. That's not me saying like, I should quit my job and pursue like full-time conduit stuff. Like, no, that's, that's not it.
But what I, what I think it does say is that like, there are things that I do that are impactful.
And the impact is probably more valuable than the things that I don't do or the things that I like, I'm currently doing that are taking up just a lot of time and really starting to look at some of those things and maybe make adjustments.
Uh, another example of this, one of our advisors for a black Python devs, I had a call with them and I told them, I was like, you know, it's weird that I, I have to, I hate writing newsletters, but every time I write a newsletter, we always get like a massive donation after.
And it's like, the thing is, is the more and more that I talk about the, the nonprofit and the thing like that. And I, and I talk about like where the money is going and how like way more of it goes to actually helping people on the ground because of how small we are.
Like people respond to that by donating. I've talked about the nonprofit twice this week. And I will tell you, I used AI. I was like, Hey, here's what I want to say. Can you make this into a post? And then like, I went in, then I edited it and then I sent it and I, and we made $1,200 in donations.
That's wow. That's literally more than we made last quarter. In donations. In two LinkedIn posts. And it's just like, Oh, I should probably be doing less of all of the other things and doing more of this thing. Right. Yeah.
That's, that's the other thing that like, you almost have to take into account. Like, how is this going to. Yeah. Looking at the bigger picture instead of being stuck. In where you're at, if that makes sense. And I think, I think that's really hard to do. Um, yeah. Oof. I'm sorry.
But like that is processing, but I'm excited for what the future will bring. I think this is going to be. Interesting. Yeah. It's going to be an interesting year. And I will rest of the, you know, August issue, issue the invitation here of, if you are a dad, one, I'm not doing another podcast.
Kathy told me I can't do another podcast. Um, and be doing all the editing and stuff for it. And if I don't have, if I don't have a, I'm not doing another podcast, but if you are a dad, and you feel like you've had some anxieties about anything, um, please reach out.
Um, you can reach out to me directly. You can't reach out to me directly. I'm pretty unreliable person to reach out to directly. Um, every, everywhere that I am on the internet at gmail.com, you can reach out to me there.
Um, that's not the full, if you know, you know, um, if you use the feedback thing in relay and it gets to me, like it'll get, it'll get to me. Um, if you just say, Hey, don't put this in the show, but you just wanted to reach out.
I, I am very interested in having more and more conversations with dads and their anxieties. If only for them to hear someone say, you're not alone in this. It's something that I'm thinking about a lot. Um, I want to be a good dad.
Like, and I, I tell people like the advice that I have to hear myself say, one, your child woke up today, which means you did something right. And then two, if you're this concerned about not screwing her up for life, then you're probably, you're probably doing a good job.
Yeah, no, that's actually, that's something that I say a lot. I'm like, if you are worried about being a good parent, then you are a good parent. Yeah. Like plain and simple. That is, it's important to think about. It's important to know.
It's important to remember that like you are, because you care, you're, you're doing well. Bad parents don't care about being, if don't care if they're bad parents. Exactly. Yeah. Good times. Good times. So, uh, what are you going to do in your next, uh, fortnight? Sleep. Um, I don't know.
I mean, you can, I don't know. I, how about you at least do the advanced directive stuff? What does that mean? Uh, like what limits you want to do? Like, Hey, if I'm completely brain dead, when do you want the pole, the plug to be pulled? Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Is there like a website I can go to and get this? Probably. It's like, is legal zoom good enough for this? I mean, it, so the thing to remember about this is that it just has to like be written down. It doesn't have to be like notary notarized or anything. Yeah. There are definitely templates.
There are definitely a lot of different options out there. I can send you over some. Okay. I was going to say, can I like, can I just type what I want in there and then go like chat GPT, make this. Yeah. Smarter. Yeah, sure.
But yeah, the biggest thing where I need to put these things, just like, like, um, wills, the legality of a will, if it's going to be contested, like, you might want to have like the notary and that type of stuff for like a big will.
But for the most part, if you scribble, everything goes to my wife. Boom. That's, that's basically a will. But yes, Laura says, like, don't just write it down, talk about it.
Um, make sure that that connection and the, the, the verbalized thing of the really hard conversations, but like, it's important to have it spoken about, discussed with the people that might have issues. If something was to happen.
I think that's the problem is I did that part first and then I didn't do the other stuff. Yeah. Um, okay. Yeah. I will, I will officially make it, uh, where's the spot where we put those in there. There we are. I will officially make it, um, informal desires doc planning document. Perfect. Love it.
Okay. What about you, Kathy? I have something that I've been putting off for a while. I have to go get my, um, passport photos to renew my passport. It's not due for a while. So like I can still, you know, travel and whatnot. But I need to have, have it happen now.
So stuff doesn't, um, like, actually expire and have a problem. So I just need to go to Walgreens, get the pictures and send that in. That's it. That's all I have to do. Uh, and so I'm going to do that.
Do you have a white background? Listen, no, I know there are ways to do it yourself, but I would much rather just go and have it done because I have heard and helped and supported so many horror stories that it's just easier to go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're right. You're right.
I'm definitely, there are times that are, there are times that it's way better to just have somebody else do it. I deeply believe about that. Yeah. I usually just get mine done at the post office. Like, our post office doesn't do it. Really? Yeah. Lame. Yeah. Yeah. It's great. Just kidding.
But like, that's dumb. I mean, just have AI do it. Just take your photo, give it to AI and say, make this a passport photo. No, thank you. Nope. Nope. You might come out with a third ear, but like, right. Yeah. No, thank you. I think I'll pass. All right.
