From Relay FM, you're listening to Conduid, the show where we condue our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduid, the show that loves to give you a little audio hug when you listen to it. The episode is brought to you by Memberful. I'm Kathy and with me today is not Jay.
Instead I added on a couple extra letters to the name and I have my friend Jane Mattingley with me today. Hi, Jane. Hello. I'm so excited to have you here. For anyone that doesn't know who you are, which is probably a lot of people on this particular wavelength, but that's going to change.
Would you like to introduce yourself and let people know where they can find you? Thank you. Thank you so much. I'm Jane Mattingley and I am, I have, well, I'm an author now. Yeah. I'm an author with Penguin Random House.
I have my book, This Is Body Grief, Coming Out in just a couple weeks on March 18th. It's available for pre-order now and it is about making peace with the loss that comes with living in a body. So it's truly written for everybody. It's a universal concept.
And I've been masters in clinical mental health counseling. I live with chronic illness and disability and I started my career working with body imaging eating disorders and I'm just really happy to be here. Yay. I love that.
And I of course am so excited to have you here, but let's get done with the business part of things. So this week in the discord, we celebrated Mike and Adina for bringing baby Sophia into the world. His paternity leave started right on time for her entrance literally the next day. She was born.
It was, it was perfect timing.
And then last week in our co-working, our superconductors and I discussed the synology and backups and then they walked me through setting up my new computer, which involved a lot of yelling at Texas Fender and ScanSnap because the permissions were not working and it was so frustrating.
So there was lots of anger involved, but I had my superconductors with me to keep me calm and the energy was good. If you want to join us for our next co-working session in the off weeks with myself and Jay or live as we're recording in the discord, go ahead and visit I am a superconductor.
com to become a member today. That's letter I letter M letter A superconductor.com. All right. And then I did instruct Jay on kind of what the connection checks are and my connection in the last two weeks was to finish cleaning my desk, which did happen. So a big green check mark for me.
Part of it I did on the superconductor co-working session while I took a break from yelling at my computer. So that was kind of nice. What did you do in the last two weeks that you want to be proud of? My goodness. There's a lot of things.
I'm just, you know, I would say honestly booking a couple of doctor appointments that I've been putting off for a long time. Yeah. And I have a colonoscopy tomorrow that I'm like dreading. You know, I'm 33 and definitely wasn't planning on getting a colonoscopy, but here we go.
You know, it's one of those things. Yeah. Absolutely. I'm really proud of myself for doing that because it's like definitely something that needed to happen where my doctor was like, you definitely need to do that. Yeah. Definitely.
Well, and booking doctor appointments that is a fairly common connection check that we have because in something that like you know, you need to do, you know, it has to happen and all you need sometimes is a little external like support and like accountability.
And we love being able to support people's individual health and like giving them that love and support that they need to, you know, take care of themselves. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Let's see how our conductors did.
Tech podcast listener of the show, Pillix says, Connected Check, Green Heart, we did have everything for this ski trip and it was a super fun weekend. Even got to spend time with my godfather who I don't see super often. I also did work on the Balachro mod and I have progress. Awesome. Amazing.
We love some progress. Our identical twin of the show, Aaron says, Green Circle, been continuing to play guitar and started learning a new song. Yay. Let us know what that new song is. I'd love to know. Our robotics engineer of the show, Aiden says, Connected Check, Green Circle.
Little did I know when I chose my connection that it would start a week longer deal to actually find the dang plugs. But finally, after exhausting every other option, I managed to find the set. Did I replace them? No. But I'm still considering buying them enough of a win.
Besides, my car still runs so it's fine. I mean, it's a good thing Jay is not here because he would make judgments, but I say, yeah, you're totally fine. There's no issues. Our soprano of the show, Debot says, Connected Check, Green Heart, mended a couple of small items for the church. Amazing.
Our Oracle of the show, Sof says, Red Circle. I am not doing very well at life right now and couldn't even manage to go swimming once, although I did meditate. But I have joined a new gym, which has a pool, which is much closer and more accessible than the pool I used to go to.
Fingers crossed that helps. I definitely hope that that helps because anything that makes anything easier is a bonus. So good luck with that. Our checklist enthusiast of the show, Mike says, Green Checkmark reorganized remaining shelves in office.
Office is mostly tidied up, but I still want to make some minor tweaks. Now the, ah, of the show, ah says Connection Check, red phone. It was a crazy couple of weeks and I totally forgot to make that phone call. Ah, wow, we'll get them next time.
Our shark of the show, Chris says last connection was to try again to find my birth certificate. Green Checkmark. I didn't seek it, but I have not found it yet. Time is ticking.
Listen, I love that you gave yourself a green checkmark for this stone because yes, you were successful in looking for it. And that is something that you control, not whether you can find it or not. So good luck. Fish bear of the show, Fishy Kai says Red Circle. I did not exercise. Oops.
That's okay. There's still next week. The nameless of the show nameless says Connection Check, Green Book and the graduation hat emoji. Taxes appointment made. Also, I am officially graduation ready.
Don't know how it happened this quickly, but I have been given the clear and I have officially been awarded my MBA. Now the fun part can begin with a trip to attend the commencement. This episode of Conduit is brought to you by memberful monetizing a passion takes work.

So, I know I really wanted to talk about body grief with you because this is something that's so like obviously you are just an incredible like advocate for this conversation and discussing and like explaining what it is to people.
And I'd love if you could explain a little bit of what that is to our audience. Oh my gosh. Yes, of course. So body grief is a term that I came up with years ago when working with eating disorders and body image, but really it's something that we've all experienced in our lives.
We just never really had a language for. You know, it can start from puberty and can go to aging, injury, chronic illness, disability, menopause, infertility, pregnancy loss, hair loss, really anything that involves change in our body when we feel that there's a loss.
When we're grieving the loss of the life that we used to live in our body or the life that we were once promised to live. And so really when I've talked to people about body grief so much of that language has given people this like this collective like exhale, this collective like, oh my God.
Yes, like I cannot believe I've never heard that or oh my gosh, yes, that is me, that is me. And you know, in the Western world, we really aren't given this grief literacy, you know. And I think I talk about that a ton of the book.
And I think there's like a big reason for that because when we are giving grief literacy, we're given a chance to, you know, grieve and bereavement and we're given time to rest and have compassion and we're given time to lean into community and that is not helpful for capitalist society.
That is not helpful for, you know, individual soldiers to like keep on working and keep on going, going, going. And so the more we disconnect from that, the more we disconnect from our bodies and then the more we disconnect from the body grief, healing journey.
And so so much of that is connected to how we work, how we like maintain the hustle. And you know, that was so huge for me is that like I was a self-proclaimed doer. I still am. Yeah, very much so. And you know, there's seven phases that I identify through my research in this book.
And this book is not like your typical self-help book. There's no band-aid solution. There's no destination. And there's so many stories from all walks of life of body grief in here from gender dysphoria to menopause to racial inequity and all the things.
And it's about like leaning into adaptive coping mechanisms rather than burning out on maladaptive coping mechanisms. So it's really about like just, it's really about accessible tools rather than like, hey, here's like a solution to fix your body grief.
Yeah, especially because I can imagine that like, there's no fix because the grief is always changing. Like every day is going to be a little bit different. Anyone that's dealt with anything that's chronic or healing or anything, which is, you know, everyone, every day is going to be different.
So your grief is going to be different. How you're feeling what you can do, what you want to do, what all of all of that is constantly different. And so like, yeah, it makes complete sense that there's not going to be a fix for it because it's right. It can't be fixed because there's nothing wrong.
It's just learning and adapting on how to survive. Exactly. Exactly. And it's harm reduction in a lot of ways rather than harm avoidance. You know, the more marginalized we are, the more body grief we experience and the less resources and more barriers we have.
And so it's a book about all those things and it's a book where everyone hopefully can really see themselves in different stories. But, you know, the body griefs too, you know, and we were really never taught that.
And like, for instance, you know, eating disorders and addictions, that is a symptom of body grief. When we are, you know, those are symptoms of body grief because we're using those as coping mechanisms to like being like, oh, you know, I don't have another resource.
And so like, it makes sense why we lean into those things. Yeah. And it's an unhealthy coping mechanism. But it's definitely a coping mechanism. It works. Yeah. Yeah. It's not great, but it works.
And sometimes all you need to survive and to continue to move on and having some sort of coping mechanism. And whatever it is that makes you feel a little bit better, just like marginally, anything you're like, oh, okay, I can get through the rest of the day and do things that have to happen.
And especially in this capitalist society where, you know, you're basically required to provide a service to the world in order to be considered fit for life. You know, you have to, you have to contribute to society.
Or you're not worthy of being, you know, a human, which is ridiculous and as a whole other systematic conversation that I feel like we can go very deep into what we're not going to. No, but eventually it burns out, right? Eventually you become like it doesn't work anymore.
And like once, you know, I think it's so true where it's like if you don't rest for your body, your body is going to rest for you. And that happened to me very clearly, you know, where like my body was giving me whispers and whispers and whispers.
And then all of a sudden it just like literally knocked me to the concrete. And that was six and a half years ago where all of a sudden, you know, like I lost my sight and I needed my first brain surgery. And, you know, then, you know, I was a non disabled, quote unquote, healthy person.
And, you know, six and a half, almost seven years later, now I'm in a wheelchair and 19 brain and spine surgeries and a total hysterectomy later. And here I am. And that sounds like a cautionary tale, but you know, it's like, and maybe it is.
But it's like, but it's like that's and I think people are like, okay, well, that's not going to happen to me. But it's like these are that this is body grief in that.
 That is no different than like there's no hierarchy to suffering in regards to like I felt so much body grief in regards to that as someone might feel body grief in regards to like they have an injury and they can no longer, you know, work the same or, you know, dance or play the same, play a sport the same because they really feel and like opposing sides with their body.
Yeah. Yeah. Listeners to this show will know I've been working through some sort of possibly arthritis and like joint stuff with my hypermobility. And so like we're going through all of that journey, which has been super fun. So hard. So hard, especially.
So for a long time, I thought because it was mainly just in my wrists and I was like, oh, it's just RSI because I'm always on the computer. And so like, you know, my body's yelling at me. So I'm doing the stuff that it says that it's supposed to do. But then my ankle started like yelling at me too.
And I was like, okay, this is not. This isn't. Yeah. This is an RSI because I'm not typing with my feet. No, you're not. Which would be like a very particular like idea of like, I don't know money making scheme, I think. Yeah, that'd be cool. But it's not. It's not.
So that that was the the thing that finally was like, okay, I need to like actually try and figure this out.
Because it's, you know, this show always is trying to talk about, you know, listening to what your body says, not what society is saying, that your productivity does not, you know, is not your value to the world and that you can't do things if you're not taking care of yourself.
And part of that is. It's like, yeah, that's the thesis of this book. Yeah. That's why I was like, yes, it's finally out. Let. I mean, I mean, these people. Our, our conductors need to know, you know, what this, what body grief is because it's so funny.
Since you first like mentioned body grief, I've talked about it to so many people. And just like it clicks for people and it's something that makes sense because people understand grief. They understand whatever it looks like. And it's difficult.
I feel like it's difficult for people to acknowledge it in themselves because so often grief is tied to external factors and external events. And it's like, yes, I can grieve the loss of a family member. I can grieve the loss of a job or a house or a pet or something.
But I, there's nothing that I, like I don't have permission to grieve who I am or something that happened wrong. And it's, it's clicked so easily for people.
And I'm very excited to be able to direct them to the book to be like, here's other stories and like, some help and support in this world because a lot of people too don't want to talk about it. No, they don't. They don't.
And I really appreciate you talking about your arthritis because that is so, so, so real. Like things that just affect our daily lives. Because it's so easy, the first phase of body grief is dismissal.
And it's so easy for us to dismiss our own, our own stuff because we are, it's internal and external dismissal.
So like, you know, doctors who are actually very, very helpful for us, but they very also rightfully so get a kind of a bad rep because the, because of our health insurance, health insurance system and they, you know, they just have to run through cases.
So that's, and like, again, that's like another book. Right. There are books out there like this. Like, there's books like medical gaslighting is a really good book that kind of talks about this. But, and it's like, they have to run through it.
So then like, they're kind of forced to like be like, you know, they were taught to just think, oh, don't look at things that are rare and think really common things. Yeah. So, of course not as zebra. Yeah, exactly. So they're, they're thinking like, okay, I, I'm going to dismiss this.
And also they were taught to not think and study women. And they were taught to not study marginalized communities. So which is not right, but this is just like how doctors were taught. And so, you know, they're going to dismiss you. They will.
And it is our job as, as patients to advocate for ourselves, but when we're tired and we're, we're, we're in pain, we're not going to. So it's only natural for the first phase of body grief to be dismissal. And we're going to gaslight the shit out of ourselves. Yes. Yes.
And it's only going to exacerbate the fact that we are grieving. So much. But eventually if we do allow ourselves to grieve and feel our feelings without judgment, we will continue to move through the grieving cycle. The next phase is shock. And, you know, like we'll continue to move through it.
And it's actually like very beautiful and it's very messy. But it's, it is like worth it. And I think one thing that can be hard is if we don't allow ourselves to do it, we get stuck. What are, what are the rest of the stages for a little sneak peak of the blood? Yeah, give you a little nugget.
Yes. I'll give you a little nuggets. So we have dismissal, which is, I'm going to give you the chapter names. Okay. So we have dismissal. I am not okay. We have shock. This is really happening. Apology. Sorry for being me. Fault. Playing the blame game. Fight at war with what is hopelessness.
Slash hope. There is a way forward. And body trust, I believe in me. Now one thing to remember is that these phases that I have studied and written and created are nonlinear and multicyclical. So you can be in one phase at a time, like you can be in more than one phase at a time.
You can be in body trust and then go right back to dismissal. Like it is nothing is linear. Nothing is finite.
You know, in, in popular culture and in movies and TV and stuff, most of the time the stages of grief are seen as, oh, well, you're going to do each step for a certain amount of time and they're going to move on.
It's kind of like depictions of childbirth with the exceptional, like called the midwife. It's like, oh, gigantic explosion of your water's breaking. And then, oh my gosh, we've got to run to the hospital and then we're going to scream and then there's a baby. Reality is not that way.
And having an understanding that it's okay that it's normal, have different stages. And having to repeat them and having to go back or forward and moving along is kind of that level of acceptance almost that is needed to be able to heal that pain in yourself.
And that mental block that can, that I think can come in because you're just like, I don't know what to do. Truly, yes. And so, yeah, it's beautifully, that's beautifully said. And this book is, you know, it's not just stories, but it's also like reflections, affirmations, skills and tools.
And yeah, like it's just something that I think everyone could use and lean into and hopefully heal. Also, the loss of bodily autonomy that's really happening in this world right now.
Yeah, there's a, there's so many things happening in the US with that and other countries as well, but it's very, very, very, very relevant right now. I'm very excited to be able to send this link out. Yeah, pre-orders are available now.
It comes out March 18th, but pre-orders are like incredibly, I'm learning more and more and more and just so important. Yeah, so important because it shows the publisher that, oh, there's interest in this. Yeah.
And so links will be in the show notes, of course, for this and for Jane's website directly. Follow her, her Instagram is incredible. And you get to see her pets. Weedies. Yeah. Weedies. Weedies, the sweetest. Weedies. She's like, her is dog. He's, oh, he's the best.
We're going on a lot of trips in like a week. Oh, yeah. We're going to be traveling a ton together. Like a ton. Weedies. Weedies. He is Jane's service dog. And I met him before it was like officially like in your, you did. You did. Like meeting each other stage when he is such a good, oh, my God.
Yeah. Oh, wow. Yeah, so it's been a couple years that you've had him. Was that in my old place before I moved here? Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. That's wild. What is time? What is time? Wow. What is time? Yeah. Yeah. That's wild.
And I love, I love those, the discussions that you have with Weedie and like, here's what he's doing and yet still, you know, showcasing, he's still a dog. He still gets to play. I loved what he did not want to come inside from the sun. Oh, my God.
He's been doing that now where he's like, I'm not coming into. Yeah. Like, I need a break. Yeah. Well, it's also just been so cold here. Like unseasonably colds in Charleston. Yeah. And he's just like, it's sunny. Like we're just going to sunbathe today. Yeah. Yeah. With little brother.
I guess his older brother, but little. He's older brother, but very small. Yeah. So cute. So cute. So cute. Oh, and then, you know, the conversations that you have around accessibility as well, I think are really, really important.
And that's part of, you know, body grief too, because these are external factors that you can't control necessarily. And so it can take a lot to have those conversations and to point out things that people don't think about.
And I know, I remember when you were discussing accessibility in downtown Charleston and the wonderful people that made comments. God. God, I can't. I got canceled. I know. Yeah, because how dare, how dare you ask for some sort of basic desire to get in the building? Yeah.
And the daily mail came for me. I couldn't, I couldn't believe like I woke up one morning and I was like, where are all of these? What's happening? And yeah, I asked, I was just like, there needs first of all, someone's parked. Um, Charles, okay, let's start here.
Charleston is a beautiful city, but it's also built. It's built on slavery. I mean, that's where slavery is where slavery started. Charleston, South Carolina, it's literally where the civil war started. It's, and they, it's a beautiful, beautiful city. I love it.
But also it's like, let's, I feel like we could do a lot better here in Charleston. I'm not from here. I'm from Chicago. I've lived here for a while now and I feel like we could, we could do a lot better seeing that it's built on slavery and the civil war, like with reparations.
And like, we're just not. Yeah. Right. And, um, we think there's no side, there's no sidewalks in any of the suburbs. Like, um, and in downtown Charleston, when I went to college at Charleston, I was very non-disabled, meaning when I say very non-disabled, that doesn't make sense.
But when I say, when I say very non-disabled, I mean, like, I was so non-disabled in the fact that my mind, like, I had no concept of what disabled was. Like, I was so able-bodied. I was ableist, you know what I mean? Yeah.
And, and there's, I think a lot of times people will shy away from, oh, mentioning or acknowledging any internal ableism or racism or any of these isms that come around because, oh my gosh, it's immediately like a negative thing.
But the truth of the matter is if you don't, if you don't know something exists, you can't work through it. And that's- Yes, I didn't know it exists. Yeah. Like, and that's why I mean, but I was like, I was so non-disabled. Yeah. I was like, sometimes I was so white, yeah, I mean.
And so I, but like, there's this thing called the Charleston shuffle and it's when you just like walk around and fall. Because the cobblestone and the bricks are so uneven. And so like, you literally just like walked to class and you just fall on your face.
And so like, imagine doing that in a wheelchair or like with a roller or something like that. And so like, you cannot get around downtown. Like, it's just impossible. And secondly, like, there's just like, everything is protected by historical, like the historical cause.
So like, if you, you know, like you can't like build or something. Well, and of course, because we all know that disabled people only came into existence a few decades ago. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly right. We're new. Yeah, it's a new issue. Yeah.
And also like, the whole argument is like that buildings are people too. And businesses are people too. Right. And so then like, people start defending capitalism over people. But also like, they forget that like I'm a business. Right. And like, it's so weird.
Like, so I was like, in my mind, it feels like an easy way to get more capitalism. It's so weird. It's so weird. And I'm like, but I'm like, do you not realize that like disabled people make up like one and five people in the US.
And so like, if you opened up your doors to disabled people, like we would come in and support your business. Right.
And so I was like, hey, like it'd be really cool if your, if your store that I've been looking forward to going to like was actually accessible and that like if you opened up like the curb cut and it didn't have a truck in it like a truck in front of it.
And so I was like, taken down on Instagram on the Daily Mail, wrote it and people were like, she should be triggering. She should be tricked, like chained up in a basement to a radiator. And I was like, what? I like, thank you for sharing some of those comments.
Like because I was like, I can't, I can't read the original spot. I'm like, I am like, it's, it's this idea. Like nothing should shock me anymore. And yet it's still the, the, the low bar is constantly moved lower on what's acceptable for people to send out in public. And I don't.
It makes me so sad that these, how these people are living their life. Like, you know, how will they, you didn't become disabled at any point? Yes. Not like, oh, you clearly did something wrong, Jane. You're a terrible person who whatever. And so this is punishment for something.
Like there's no barrier to what, you know, it can, it can literally happen to anybody at any time. Yes. And I want to say, when I say I was ableist, I wasn't ableist like that. I was ableist and then I just didn't know about it. I didn't think about it. I just didn't think about it.
Like, you know, if I saw someone in a wheelchair, I'd like definitely help them and probably advocate for them. But like I didn't think about it. Like I didn't think like, oh, this place isn't accessible or, you know, it just wasn't on my radar.
But I definitely would not make any comments like that. No, I wouldn't be like this person needs to be chained to a radiator. I'm sorry. What? I'm sorry. Like that's just hate. Yes. And also, also like I don't understand that.
I don't like how does that even come to your brain? I mean, I mean, at that point, I mean, I think God, they're cheering it to me. Like, thank God the heat is coming to me at that point because I can handle it. Yeah. The unfortunate thing is it's not just to you. Not just to me.
But I'm like, there's someone else that they're really hurting out there. And that's so, it's so unfortunate. But that's another another great reason to follow Jane on social media. I mean, if I can do it a little on the end over on my social media.
But it's, you know, it's sprinkled out with great puppy pictures. I'm trying to think of, I mean, we covered most of the main things that I really wanted to touch on. Is there anything else you wanted to share? I don't think so. No, this is so fun. I love it.
I'm excited to more easily share you with an audience. Because I have a friend that has just hit some significant medical things. And I sent him over to you and he messaged me. I was just like, thank you for this.
I'm like, I hear that pretty much anytime that I've sent someone to you because it's so real. And it's, I'm excited that this can go out into a different circle in an easier instead of one-on-one way because it's really been extremely helpful to for myself.
And so I know it can be helpful for my listeners too because everyone is going through something. Everyone is going through something truly.
And yeah, it's one of those things where it's like everyone like goes through body grief, everyone, like no matter how old you are, no matter your demographic, it's just something that everyone goes through. And even a little thing like I stubbed my toe. Yes. Wait, yes.
It's not going to be this, it doesn't have to be, I had 19 brain surgery and spinal reconstruction and all of the things. No, no, no.
And if you have just these small moments, learning those, learning these tactics and ways to adjust with that can help other people if you're having them go through it.
But then also if something happens to you that's larger than stubbing your toe, you already have the tools in place to help go through it as much as you can. It's so true. Being in touch with our bodies and our minds and our spirits and connecting it all, it's a big deal. Wow. And it's resistant.
Yes. It's resistant to like, you know, I know we have to live in a capital society and be in it, but it's also like a little bit of resistance to it too when we can connect to our bodies. Yeah.
And say, you know, put those boundaries in place of like, yes, you know, my capitalism and society says that I'm only worthy if I'm providing a service to the world. But guess what? I'm going to take a nap this afternoon and it's going to be great.
And that's going to be a little bit, you know, of safety, safe resistance against the world and what it brings out because. Yep. Yeah. You don't have to go out and be protesting in marches every day to resist and support, you know, society as a whole and what you can do for your fellow humans.
