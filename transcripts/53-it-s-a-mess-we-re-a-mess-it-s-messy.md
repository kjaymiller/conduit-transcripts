From Relay FM, you're listening to Conduit, the show we Condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that messes with the messiness in a way that's probably messy. This episode is brought to you by MicroDop Blog. I'm one of your hosts, Jay.
And with me, the unicorn of time, the most famous internet's busiest unicorn, the absolute profound, possibly hoved celestial mythical creature that happens to probably be on all of the dawns, the skies, the tweets, the grams, the threads, the one Kathy Campbell. Hi, Kathy. Oh, oh, that's me. Hi.
That's intimidating, but you know what, it's fine. It's fine. I was with people this weekend and somebody was asking what I do in my job. You make magic happen. Yeah, that was kind of it. But then I mentioned podcasts and one of the people I was talking to says, oh, yeah, I know I listen.
I was like, oh, oh, there's people that actually listen to podcasts in real life. That have heard my voice that are in different spheres. It's very strange.
Kathy, if you'll remember, there was an episode of a show called Friends in Your Ears, where I promoted a potential podcast idea of the Los Angeles Yodeling Club. Happy to say Yodelae can be found kidding. Kathy, what happened this week in the Discord? Oh, my goodness. All right.
So first off, if you are a member of Relay FM, switch on, I highly recommend that you listen to this month's episode of Spotlight, where I talk with hosts from the show and the Discord asked them anything, sends questions so that I can do an AMA with them.
And this month was with Julia Alexander from Downstream. And it was an absolute delight. If you have not listened to any of them, please go listen to this one. Julius, Julius. Where's Julius? Where's Julius? Oh, that sounds good. Julia is incredible.
She is so entertaining and so fricking smart that it just like is brilliant.
But in addition to that, it's getting to be podcasted on time again in that we're doing the planning stage of it, which means we are I am collecting questions for the co-founders quiz this year, which I will get to be doing in person with our hosts, which is absolutely going to be fantastic.
So make sure to head out to the Discord if you remember to fill out the questionnaire thing so that we can get questions researched and time to have Mike and Steven answer them. So yeah, lots of fun in the Discord.
And usually in the off weeks, we have a super wonderful co-working session with our super wonderful super conductor friends. However, last week there was a holiday thing that was happening. I like to call it Terrifier Dogs Day. I was not happy.
But we thought it might be best to let all of our US-centered superconductors and our US-centered hosts being both of us. Take that time to spend time with family, friends, panicking dogs, and just take that time off. But don't worry, because next week, next week, it's back on. It's back on.
It's going to be, it's going to be, it's going to be amazing, Kathy. I can't even begin to tell you that this accent is probably coming to a conduit near you. I'm so excited. But we can't talk about that yet.
If you want to know why that accent is coming soon, the easiest way to figure out is to go to I'm a superconductor.com. That is letter I, letter I, letter A, superconductor.com. Become a member today. You'll get access to our pre-show where we talked about Jay's Fast Nation with Prince.
We talked about someone who plays a ukulele really badly. Well, we actually had no judgment on their ukulele skills, but they just do other bad things. And then we talked about why Kathy is about to be in the most trouble of all time if things don't happen.
And if you want to know why, again, letter I, letter M, letter A, superconductor.com. Kathy, it's time for connection checks. Is that a-up? Oh, jeez. You're right. That again. How'd you do? I did as well as you did, Jay, looking at our show notes here. I did not touch. I know. It's fine.
I did not touch a single box. My connection was to clear out the front room. Did not touch any of them. My July is absolutely ridiculous. It's not getting any better. In fact, it will get worse for potentially many reasons. And that means that it's survival time.
So I don't feel a little bad about my red X because I am still here. I'm still alive. I'm sleeping, which is all good. So yeah. I don't know. I don't know. What about you, Jay? I don't know. What about you, Jay? I don't know.
It would be more fun to do a show in my absolute most southern accent or to do a show in the 90s rock. I'm still alive. Like that whole voice. Oh, yeah. No, I didn't. I know. Yeah, we're moving. And I needed, I thought I needed some me time. And yeah, me time was not afforded.
The only me time that I got was like sitting in my room with a glass of whiskey watching a documentary about one of my favorite musicians of all time. And that happened last night. So there is, there is like not much time to do anything as we will talk about.
Not alone, get a manicure or a pedicure. Let alone both of those things at the same time. But it is absolutely needed. You can't hear them, but my dogs is barking. Okay. So I am going to... I'm sorry, your feet hurt. Yeah, that's... I'm so funny. So funny, y'all.
Do you need to go take care of them? No, no, I... That's exactly what I meant was my feet hurt. So in many ways, you are funny. But you know what is funny? The fact that even though we didn't do a lot of stuff, I'm seeing a lot of green from our conductors. Yeah.
So how do our conductors do? Yeah, Code Monkey of the show Douglas. Unfortunately, we're going to start with a red square, but that's okay. I didn't say that one up well. No, no, but that's okay. You're forgiven. I could have, you know, adjusted, but I didn't think ahead of the time.
So you know what, that's fine because real life is messy. Code Monkey of the show Douglas says red square made more messes and spent way too much time on work instead of getting my office more organized or me time because I got slammed at work.
On a positive note, my garden is very happy, which makes me very happy. That's green. Yeah. Green thumb. Yes. No, that's true. Green thumb for Douglas because I don't have a garden. I have a messy front yard and it's growing. What is that mode? How do I garden? Yeah, I don't know.
The blue dragon of the show, Skylar says blue heart back home from the beach vacation, making the time to relax. Sounds like someone's getting a vacay for their vacay. Hey, hey, hey, vacay. Yeah.
Our soprano of the show Debo says connection check greens square contacted an electrician and have them scheduled to come next week for an estimate. Yay. You did the hard part, which is connecting. So well done.
The, I thought somebody's not thought I said the super Canadian trivia card enthusiast of the show. I mean, yeah, we can call her the super Canadian trivia card enthusiast of the show. The super Canadian trivia card enthusiast of the show. Erica. Especially since she's in the live stream right now.
She made it. Her. Oh, Erica says green dragon finished and scheduled two weeks of TPK. So check out that podcast. Kathy's on it. There's a lot of fun things that happen. You said, uh oh. Just because chaos reigns, but yes, okay. Yeah. Yep.
Two weeks of TPK and picked and of the show, the super Canadian trivia card enthusiast of the show. And it works on two levels. She's Canadian. She's super and a bonus one. She has feelings about trivia cards and those cards are of Canadian origin. And that's why our trivial pursuit started.
I love this. And also I love the Erica's hanging out with us. For those that want to hear all of us hanging out with Erica, check out an episode of the show that Erica does that I was on. Random pursuit. Yes. Random pursuit. Hey, I had never got a notification that that episode went live.
I'm guessing that you could hear it. I'm guessing that you can hear us on the show at some point. If you can, we'll have a link to the show notes. We'll have a link in the show notes.
If there, but I'm a professional podcaster, I'm definitely not trying to find it on the internet because that would be silly.
So instead, we're going to move on to our panda of the show James who says, connection check, green check mark, 90% packed for his trips, 90% sensible life choices made, 10% inner piece achieved. I'll still take that as a win. Abs of flipping lootly. That's 190%.
That's a hundred and ninety percent. I like it. James, where are you going? Let us know. We already know. Yes. Yes. And it's classified if we told you we'd have to unsubscribe you from the show.
Our civil engineer of the show, Dan, says connection check, green heart, successfully organized my projects and made a priority list and got stuff done. It feels good. It does feel good. Congratulations, Dan. Yeah, getting stuff done.
Our shark of the show says connection check, sad face, my connection to develop and start a plan for a secret project was a fail. The plan was too ambitious and I got sick as I started to try to execute it. I will revise and try again.
This is great because trying and failing does not mean that you have failed as a whole. And so re adjusting, re-evaluating, recognizing your humanity and being able to turn around and say, okay, I'm good to go. Let's make these adjustments is the true sense of absolute amazingness.
So I'm super excited for you. Our train enthusiast of the show, Ralezy, says green circle, plain emoji, sorry, the text is really small. Plain landing emoji. Plain landing emojis. Made most of the holiday, had a good time, great time, only on day two of returning back.
But I have appeared to have stolen everyone's sleep as I slept for 14 hours on Sunday. I was intending to nap to charge my watch and phone for an hour. It was not a nap. It was a sleep and 11 hours last night. So yeah, that's kind of a lot. That's okay.
The body does what the body needs and the body needs to sleep. So you got your sleep back. Just try to stay awake at some point. And try to save some sleep for the rest of us, please. And thank you. Yes. Identical twin of the show, Aaron says, connection check, green Christmas tree.
I guess just green ever green tree because there's no Christmas lights on it. So green tree enjoyed the heck out of my trip. Hiked 51 kilometers over six days and saw so much beauty that the Rocky Mountains have to offer. If anything, I wish I was still there. I am so excited for you.
That sounds terrible to me, but that's okay because people are different. I'm so excited you had a great trip. Our Oracle of the show, so says yellow heart. I've mostly managed to swim once a week. Just missed one week. It's a good late one to we okay. Yep. Sorry. Nope. I can't I I process.
You're doing great, Jay. You're doing great. Mostly man. Swim once a week. Just missed one week. It's a good start to the habit. Yes. Agreed. Yes. Yes. Perfect. Correct. Swimming. Swimming in the pool. Swimming is really cool. I don't know where this is going.
Well, before my voice starts to get a little, hey, Kathy, who's next? Uh-huh. Our mountain dweller of the show. Hello, okay. Green square mostly. We decided to do a bunch of small micro housewarming parties with just a couple friends each instead of one big overwhelming one.
So we have the first one scheduled. That is such a smart idea. I love that idea. So you don't have to plan this overwhelming like huge. Oh, trying to find things where, you know, when everyone can come together and like have big food things or whatever. I love this for you. I'm so excited.
And we've got folks. We've got a double. A double because I think I added it wrong. So we're going to ignore what we said earlier. But that means, as I said before, it's all green around here.
The Code Monkey the Show, Douglas says, Greenheart delegated project to a subcontractor, which allowed work to get done on a time crunch and made for some awesomely stress free weekends and said no to a couple of other things.
And I say that as I immediately go, oh no, because apparently there was one more that I got that in as I just professed. It's fine. It's fine. We're doing great. The nameless of the show slipped in under the radar. Connection check, red circle.
I completely forgot about my connections and did not go to the puppy training class. You know what? That's okay though. Doesn't have a name. Doesn't count. Yep. We're perfect. Exactly. All set. This episode of Condo is brought to you by micro.blog.
Blogging is still the easiest way to share stuff on the web. And micro.blog is the easiest way to blog. Personal blogging is making a comeback thanks to all the disruption in social media. So if you have always wanted to build your own place on the internet, keep and share the stuff you love.
Micro.blog is for you. Micro.blog is the blog you will actually use because we've made it so easy to write short or long blog posts, share photos, keep a log of the books you read and even create your own podcast. There are so many things you can do with a blog at micro.blog.
It's a great place to host a site dedicated to your special interests or hobby. For example, check out stickerspotter.com, the brainchild of Mike Madira, who's a photographer and micro blogger in Lisbon.
Mike loves to find cool stickers on his daily walks around the city and he collects them on stickerspotter.com. Just sit at micro.blog. Check out stickerspotter and see how fun it can be to dedicate a blog to your hobby. You can follow Mike too.
He is just one of the most friendly, interesting people who make the micro.blog community such a special place. JD, have any micro.blog? Yeah, follow me. KJ Miller, micro.blog. That's me. Follow me. I try to post. I'm not feeling very social right now, K. But it's okay.
That's the nice thing about social media is that you can choose when to do it and when you want to be social versus not social. Micro.
blog hosting normally starts at $5 per month, but right now you can get their special summer of blogging introductory offer and have fun sharing your summer for just $1 a month. I'm not sure if you're going to be showing it in the summer of blogging. Summer of blogs. Oh. Had you micro.
blog? Slash summer to sign up now. Thanks to micro.blog for their support of the show and all of relay FM. I say thanks in a different language every time. We're going to try it into mill. You can do it. None three. I'm pretty sure I did that wrong.
I had to play that back about 15 times and I still think I got it wrong. If I got it wrong, if you speak to mill, let me know. But then also, I'm sorry. And we still love you. And thank you. Kathy. I have a child. Child be making messes. I have dogs. Dogs be making messes. Have a cat.
Cat be making messes. I have myself. I be making messes. I have a unicorn friend. I'm making a corn friend. You be making messes. You know, we were talking about this interesting concept. A few episodes back about what to do when you can't even or cannot. I say a couple of episodes back.
I'm pretty sure that was like a year ago. Yeah. If not more. But probably more time is weird. Maybe that time is, yeah. But what's interesting is we are often trying to figure out a game plan for navigating around like the messy, like you've got too much to do.
It's like you've got too many tasks to complete. It's a mess. Well, what do you do? Well, you say it less. You do less. You check your tire pressure and things, you know, and honestly, for both of us, the past conduit has been an absolute like, barrage of things happening beyond our control.
Like I think we've talked about it before. I'm moving. I don't know what people have, I don't know how many people have tried to move across the country before, but there's a lot of things that you have to think about. But you also have to figure out like when you need to do those things.
Because if you do them too soon, moving dates might move. And then you got to pay lots of money to fix them. If you do it too late, stuff happens and people aren't ready and then you got to find someone else and you got to pay lots of money and you go without sleep.
I wonder which side of the wheel that I'm on. No idea. But on top of that, I have my commitments with my family, my commitments, you know, here with selling this house and also, you know, my job, that's a whole thing. Got a whole job that I got to do. Life right now is a mess.
I don't know what the next hour or two looks like because up until last, like this past weekend, people were literally scheduling to come into my house and look at it to offer me money for it.
And that meant that like at a moment's notice, I had to stop what I was doing, grab everything and start moving.
Kathy, I've heard your condo, it's been messy too, right? Oh my gosh, it has been, so this past weekend, I pretty much spent more time traveling to a thing than I spent at the thing, which is fine. It was a good, you know, it's for a good reason.
It's for like an awesome, like group of people, like it was good, but I still had to fly to Atlanta, which is a very, it's difficult for our west coasters to do as a whole to go to the east coast. But I did it, I survived, I made it back, but I'm exhausted.
And in it, I am so tired because I also have, like this next condo, it is going to be even more bananas. And again, it's mostly actually even fun things. I'm spending time with people that I really enjoy and some that I haven't met in person before.
And like it's going to be great, it's going to be awesome. So many opportunities involved in there is also Taylor Swift.
Like it's, it's, it's going to be great, but it's also exhausting because anytime you go anywhere and do anything, you also need to like, I don't know, pack things and eat things and take care of other people that you have a responsibility for.
My kid is at dance camp all week, so they're not even like home to help with, you know, things, making sure everything's fine. It's just, I am so, I'm so tired. I'm pre-tired.
Again, we've talked about it before being pre-tired and whatnot, but like, it's, it's messy because there's so many things that could change at a moment's notice. So many things that easily could be a complete disaster that I can only do so much about.
And I'm, again, I'm just, it's messy and I'm doing my best and I'm trying to acknowledge the fact that this is okay. And everything's going to be all right. And whatever happens is going to happen and it's going to be fine.
Not only is it going to be fine, but it will be a success because in the end, good things will still happen. And yes, I'm doing my best. Thank you, James. But sometimes I wish that my best was better, but it's okay because I have people to support me. I just, folks, you can hear it in our voices.
There's so much. There's just so much right now. And the thing that, you know, ultimately we were going to talk about like, how are we even managing? And, and I would say, I don't know. Yeah. I genuinely don't know.
For me, I've best been managing by making sure, one, I've been leaning on my calendar way more. Everything has to go into the calendar because I have to be ready to tell somebody, know it like a heart, like at like a minute's notice.
 And I mean, it has to be as simple as like, oh, I have to add big grocery store trip to the calendar because if someone decides that they want to view our house right during or before a big grocery store trip, we're not there to clean, you know, to clean up and make sure things are looking their best.
So I have quite leaned heavily on just having everything blocked, not even like time blocking levels, but just like, hey, what are you doing? Throw that in the calendar. Hey, what are you thinking about doing? Throw that in the calendar.
Hey, what is, what could potentially happen in a one in a million opportunity to see the internet's most awesome unicorn and the internet's most amazing artist, apparently, at the one place at the same time, according to TMZ, just put it in the calendar.
Everything has like, I've had to be so meticulous and just on top of everything and up front and honest with my teammates at work and my boss and just say, hey, like, you know, this is coming. You know, this is happening. You know where we are with this whole process. It is madness right now.
Yeah, I think the hardest, the hardest part for this, for me, is the out of control nature of it.
 I don't know if you, if you know this, but I like, I like to be in control of things because so much of my life is out of control that it becomes difficult to be able to like, when there's stuff that's out of control and I can't fix it, I easily get overwhelmed and it gets frustrating and it's exhausting and, you know, it's, I was going to say it's fine.
And it is, I know that this is a, not a failure necessarily, but it's definitely a, like, a concern, a self-awareness that I have basically.
I know how difficult it is and how, how exhausting it's making me and I know I do deserve, you know, patience and like kindness to myself and all of that and I'm learning and I'm working on it and all of that. But it's sometimes I wish I could do better and again, it's, I'm, I'm okay.
Everything's okay. It's going to be good. It's going to be fine. I will, you know, I have forgiveness for myself. I know what's going on. It's going to be good.
Right in the middle of it, it's so easy to just kind of sit in this overwhelm and not be able to do anything because I see this long list of things that need to happen and instead of being able to do things, I shut down.
For example, one of the things I'm doing is putting together a grocery list for an event that I have going on this week. There's about 30 of us that are hanging out in Airbnb's and we're making sure that there's enough food for everybody.
So I collected people's like particular, what do you like to drink?
 What sort of soda, like put all of these things in a Slack channel and people answered and I have a huge list, but the thought of going into each of those slack threads and pulling the information and like putting it into somewhere else completely, like my brain just shut down and I was not able to do it.
But because I have amazing friends and people, someone else did it, it took them like 10 minutes to do. She sent it over to me and she's like, here you go.
And I'm just like, I definitely, definitely found like the stress of it hit harder than like the actual task would have taken, but because brains are dumb, brains are special. We love our brains. It can be, it can be too much sometimes.
And so I'm also, I'm working on forgiving myself and giving myself the support that I need. I'm also like, I'm doing dinner with a friend tonight that's not involved with the thing, like just to decompress and try and like take my mind off of everything.
I am also planning on taking a nap this afternoon and I haven't scheduled it my day because I know I need to be kinder to myself than even normal, more so than normal. And so it's, it's, it's interesting. So yeah, when you have a mess, it's difficult to manage.
But I know that having supportive people around you is also important. And so yeah, that's kind of where that is. Thank you to my community that are so awesome. I don't have to say everything that Kathy just said because she's awesome and said it. And I just agree with it.
Relying on family, relying on coworkers asking for help and you need it. Yeah. I've truly had to do that more. And I think something that we were, we're, I think over, we're shadowing on this is we're putting some of this on us intentionally for good reasons. Like I, I deal with my anxieties.
My partner has her own anxieties. And we know each other's strengths and weaknesses and rely on each other to pick up the things that it might be harder for me, but it could, it could be debilitating.
And with, you know, on top of all the messiness that is just life in general, you know, Kathy has the, the added note of being a caregiver.
And so a lot of these things are not just, we're not, because that's the thing that I always love when, when people are just like, oh, yeah, you just got to do less. And it's like, well, I mean, sure, sure, that was really an option.
Like, not not to get angry at the listener because you all did nothing wrong. No, not at all. But this, this is why we wanted to address the idea of messiness because a lot of folks try to attack it from the perspective of, well, you don't have to have the messiness, just, just don't be messy.
And it's like, sure. Okay. Yeah. I would love that. My, my child puts slime in her hair yesterday. Like, that's like, what kind of messiness? What, what book do I read to avoid that one? Yeah.
Uh, I, so I got home from the airport late Sunday night, um, after flying home from Georgia, uh, and the first two hours of being home were spent doing, um, caregiving tasks that needed to happen. I could not, uh, relax.
It took a while for me to, um, like calm down and, uh, like, decompress enough to fall asleep, um, because, you know, I had to do other things that I didn't plan for, but it happens. And there's nothing that I could have done. Phew. Excuse me.
There's nothing that I could have done differently to prepare separately for this. Like, it's just not, it's not possible to make those changes. And that's okay. I'm going to do my best. I'm going to continue to do my best and, um, be aware of it. And, uh, hopefully give myself more kindness. Yes.
And, I mean, the last thing I'll throw out there is, um, I've retreated into taking time to play video games every once in a while, you know, give myself an hour at the end of the day.
Um, obviously we're, we're not going to talk about what game I play because, uh, spoiler alert, Kathy's going to be playing it at the end of the show. Oh, no. Um, oh, no. Yeah. If you want to see that, you got to, you got to be a superconductor.
But, um, I am making time for myself, which, again, sure I failed on my connection check to get a mani-pedi. What I would say, in, in all things when it's messy, find the one clean thing that you got for yourself and like, hold onto that thing for dear life.
For me, that's putting my child to bed and then going into my room and, you know, stack in blocks or, you know, pretending that I'm a GM of a baseball team and doing weird fantasy draft things and like, I don't know, trying to win a World Series or something.
But I know that these things are limited. I can do that in a single run in like an hour and by the end of it, I can just be done, put it away and until next time and then come back to it and start from zero all over again, which is really what I need.
But yeah, find, find those things that aren't so messy and your messy routine when you, when you have these kinds of situations and do your best to make even a little bit of time, five, 10, 15 minutes, a little bit of time.
I started doing Duolingo again just because it gave me something to do other than doom scrolling when I go on my biologically required breaks.
Yeah, I've been playing a lot more Zelda because it's so peaceful to just get on a horse and ride around places and do kind of whatever I want in a world that is low key.
And if I don't want to, I still have, so I've got three of the big bad guys beaten and I'm too, I finished like a temple for the last fourth one. And I can't ever get around, I can't beat it. And I'm just like, you know what, that's okay.
I'm gonna just not do that and I'm gonna go around and I'm gonna just ride on my horsey. And so right now I'm kind of going around and trying to collect all of the extra special like weird horses that you can get. I just got the golden one, which is fun. I guess spoilers for tears of the kingdom.
And it's so low key to like just be like, I'm done with this, I'm gonna go over here. And if I die, it's fine because I'll just like I don't lose anything really. But it's also weird not having my kid home. They won't be home when I leave for the weekend either, which is also strange.
Just lots of things are messy and I'm doing my best. Kathy is taking her horse to the old town road. She's gonna ride it so she can't move. All right, once again, this podcast is over. But I'm better. Wow. Wait, why would a unicorn need a horse? Because I need support.
So the horse is just, it's a workhorse, I see how it is. Yep, yep, yep, it's the moral support horse. No horn, that means you get in the back when work. Yep, yep, exactly, exactly. Yeah, messiness is okay. Messiness is normal, messiness is acceptable and necessary in life.
And you know what, I will say this though, I have said no to things that I'm very proud of because I still want to do them. And but I knew that my energy wouldn't like my, my tire pressure was gone. And so I said no to something that I actually am sad because I really wanted to do.
But it's for, it's really for the best. And I feel so much better having said like no and canceling on this, which like good, good, good job for me. Go me. I am proud of myself. At the end of every ad reading, we'll say no thanks.
Just kidding, just kidding, we love our ads, we love our sponsors very much. To the end of our, well, to our messiness, we'll say no thanks. Yes, no to our met, our met, our methanes. Oh, we definitely say no thanks to our methanes.
Yeah, but to our messiness, we say we acknowledge you and just like you, but still realize that hey, this happens and do our best.
Yeah, speaking of doing our best, what are we going to do our best to do? Or what are we going to do? What are we going to try to do our best to do in the next conduit? Oh goodness. I am going to have fun. Make time to see your co-host. Yes. Yeah. I am going to live in the moment.
How about that?
 There are so many like really special moments that are coming down the pipe in the next two weeks and I want to be able to sit and enjoy the vibes as the kids say and really like live in the exciting things that are happening and be able to enjoy them and experience them fully in whatever that looks like.
You're going to do it for the vibes? Yes. I'm putting that in my connection. Do it for the vibe? Okay. I like that. That's a good one. I'm going to do a little bit of logistic stuff only because I'll explain why. I'm going to get our cable stuff set up for the new house.
And the reason being is if I don't, the first conduit in the new house will be in the middle of August. And if I don't get it done in the next two weeks, the internet probably won't be on for me to do it. Yeah, I think we need an internet. Exactly. Plus you couldn't do your work either. Yeah.
I mean, there is also that. But we know the real important things in life is conduit. That's my connection is to get a connection. An internet connection if you will. I love it. That's a good word. And for our conductors.
Our blue dragon of the show, Skylar says, New Connection, redo my resume and start applying for some interesting jobs. I love it. Job hunt.
Our soprano of the show, Devo, says, Next connection, stick with the scheduling things with trades people theme and contact someone to pressure wash our patio and possibly to restrain our porch. Oh, that reminds me of another thing that I got to do. Thank you, Devo for that reminder.
Our Canadian trivia, sorry, are super Canadian trivia card enthusiasts of the show. Erica says New Connection have a good time on her road trip, but not so good at times she ends up tired out and sick after the trip as so often happens after travel. Got to learn to take it easy more often.
Apps of freaking Lutley, taking it easy. There's a song in there, but I don't remember what it is. So I'm going to just pause and say, continue on. Please, Jay. Our giant black and white bamboo eating animal of the show, James says, have a good time on the trip, but not such a good time.
Wait a minute. Didn't you just read this one? I guess the spreadsheet's broken. Looking forward to meeting up with some very good friends. Good job, Jay. James and Jay. Anyways, Shark of the show.
My connection for the next fortnight is to get my office cleaned up and starting to have an effect on my focus. Yeah, I need that. And our training enthusiast of the show, Ralezy, says return back to the sewing of things and stop stealing everyone's sleep.
Yeah, we're going to call the the sleep patrol on you. Yes, the sleepy pop patrol. Haha. Oh, all right. Okay, fine. Our identical twin of the show Aaron says new connection. I shipped a demo of my side project this week looking to make improvements to it engage overall interest in the game.
Heck, yeah, super excited for you. I especially love the part where we show up because of course we're in it, right? Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Our oracle of the show. So, so set up a project box for the new journal article and do 15 minutes of writing a day at least five times a week.
 You know what, I'm going to give it to so if no one else wants to give so their flowers, I'm going to I absolutely love how Sof has been using these connection checks to just do some actionable stuff and to just turn out content left and right for going on two years now, which is I'm so proud of so dude, they are killing it.
Oh my goodness. The best way. I see this and I'm just like another one like this is just it's so good. It's so good. Amazing. Our mountain dweller of the show. Logan. Logan. So celebrate. Actually have the Housewarming parties take my wife out for our anniversary and enjoy both of our birthdays.
Oh, that's so awesome. We're I need I need to hang out with Logan. This is this is this is gotta I say that because again, Housewarming and anniversary, these are two things that are happening for us right now that are conflicting with each other.
So we we're very much in the same scope of planning right now. Yes. For sure. And then our code won't keep thinking that's the last one and then I'd go to the next page. I kind of like you have the show Douglas says keep simplifying and saying no and or delegating. Yes. Absolutely. Amazing.
Our final connection of the show comes from the nameless of the show new connection. Remember about the train puppy training classes this conduit. I also want to be better about listening to music instead of having three screens on in the background while working.
I am ending my work day feeling like I need more screen time while already feeling tired from having all those screens. I am only half watching. Don't forget about the puppy training classes next time. Oh, it was edited. Okay. Hold on. Let me try this again. New connection.
Don't forget about the puppy training classes next time. Also, I've realized that I've been feeling tired at the end of my work days due to having three screens on in the background.
I want to make a better effort to listen to music instead as I've been overwhelmed and tired by the end of the day, even though I'm not fully engaged with any of the screens. I hope that music calms my mind in the same way these screens do. That is a really, really great one.
Not just the puppy training, but also like learning what your body is doing and how it's reacting is so important and being able to acknowledge this and recognize it is pretty incredible. So well done. Yes. If you would like to submit a connection, you can do so in the relay FM switch on discord.
