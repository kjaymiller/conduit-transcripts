From really FM, you're listening to Conduid, the show where we condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduid, the show that is really privileged to have you listening to us. So thank you for that. This episode is brought to you by micro.
blog and finally I'm Kathy and with me today still somehow for some reason is my friend Jay Miller. Hi Jay. Thank you and you're welcome. I profess that with our members show this year. This year definitely made me question everything about my co host. It will be out in the next.
Well, when you listen to this not live in the next week, I think. So if you are a member of any show on relay, you have access to the crossover feed, which will give you access to the member shows that get sent out by a variety of different shows on the network.
Let's you kind of experience the energy and vibe of the host and do something a little bit and have them do something a little bit different, a little bit fun. So make sure to check that out in this year's episode Alex Cox and Jay and I play a game of cuddle Mary deactivate.

It looks fine. That's all I got. It looks fine. That's all I got. Thank you for your deep knowledge and information, I guess. I mean, hey, I've been an Apple user since 2000 and something. 2000 and nine, I think, or 2010. And I've kind of just stopped caring.
I think I said that the last, I think I think literally the last episode that I did of my old show with special guest host, Kathy Campbell was about us going through WDC and then me sitting there and waxing poetic about how like, it just doesn't hit like it used to. It's not the same.
And unfortunately, I don't think there's anything that they can do to really fix that. Like be boring, be reliable. If you're boring and reliable, I will continue to use you. You don't have to knock one out of the park every year. Yeah, I'm okay being reliable.
Like that's there's something, something special about having something that just works, which really in this world that we currently live in, something just working, it's pretty darn great. I will take it. Congratulations, Apple. You're the new windows. We. Oh my goodness.
Okay, well, what happened last week in the co-working session? We did stuff, a lot of stuff mostly stuff around planning a live event. And you know, that's not too much to talk about. It's not a real live event yet. We got to figure out how to get Kathy to the secret location.
And then we also talked about how long it takes to take a train ride into the city. And we talked about coffee gear because you have myself in nameless in the chat. Of course, of course, when we're asked about coffee recommendations or coffee gear recommendations, we're going to pop off.
Yeah, they're going to have so many thoughts. Yep. Yep, yep. Yeah. So yeah, that's what we talked about. Nice. Nice. Quick.
Well, and if you want to join us for our next co-working session in the off weeks with myself and Jay and some other friendly super conductors, you can visit I am a super conductor. That is letter I letter M letter A super conductor.
Com to become a member of this show in particular and have access to that. It's a lot of fun. It's been even more wonderful to get to know our super conductors on a one to one basis and learn kind of the projects that they're working on. And sometimes we even get some work done. So that's great.
I feel like since we've hit like episode 100, we've really been in our stride for like the like after like the post show and the co-working sessions and things like that. We've been really just doing some new. I feel like we've really figured out kind of what our pre show post show vibe is.
We've been really narrowing it down. So I'm really proud of us. Good job. Great work team. What about your connection? How do you do this past fortnight? I was supposed to make a note of what I do versus what I what I won't do. To say that I forgot about that was a complete understatement.
I totally forgot. But I did have this thing that came up kind of organically that took place of it. And I don't know if I want to talk about it now or talk about it like in another episode and maybe in another episode because I haven't fully finished doing it.
Yeah, let's let's check it out in the next maybe that could be our topic for the next episode. So we're ready. Yeah, because I've got a good post show episode, a post show topic. Kathy, I've started playing catch in the front yard. Oh, it's with with with your kid with Brittany.
Oh, yeah, it's your child just doesn't get a come play with you. That's kind of being well, we did play this afternoon while I was taking my lunch break. And I mean, basically we like hung out there for about 10 minutes and then she was very much like I'm done with this.
Yeah, that that that tracks that tracks. All right, well, I also did not do my connection. My connection was to clean my desk. And I did start not actually cleaning the desk.
I started doing the pre-work because I needed to find a shelving something to store things so that they are not on top of my desk because I went from a two file cabinet desk to a set stand desk, which has just one tiny little drawer. And it's been difficult change. But I'm working towards it.
So spoiler alert for the end of the show that's going to be my connection for the next four night. To actually finish what I said I would do. So hopefully it will not be in the 90s for every day for the next two weeks. So I will be able to be in my office because right now. But I love the 90s.
I love the 90s. All right, what about our conductors? Hey, all it's Jay here. Just a heads up. Apparently there is still a glitch in the Discord bot. I'm going to report that. But I think I have everything that I need to do the of the show. So without further ado, let's give it a shot.
The Oracle of the show. So says connection check. Broccoli. I've been using the exercise of bike a lot. Having it just downstairs is a low barrier to entry. And I can listen to conduit while pedal. That's that's the way to do it. Our tech podcast listener of the show. Pillax says Apple.
Green Apple. That is we did do the hoping and so far it worked. Mrs. Pillax has gotten news from the company and it's promising. We're still waiting on them to send the contract. But they seem very interested. Awesome. Our doll of the show. Dolly.
We're going to say Molly because that's the name there. Also welcome. Oh, also my name is Molly. Yes. Perfect. Greenheart. I promise myself I'd try hopping on the connections train doing that. Now I guess. Welcome. Welcome to this show.
Welcome to the connection train as we call it all aboard all aboard the connection train. Molly. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. We have Mike who is our checklist enthusiast of the show. Says with the check mark clean up my personal task list and get some projects off my list.
Knocked out a few projects and got more control over my projects list. Sounds like you've been doing a lot of checklist in the thoozy asm which is great. Our code monkey of the show Douglas says stop sign. Got nothing accomplished in the last two weeks due to ongoing health issues.
Still trying to figure out why they decided to flare out. Honestly, get better. That's that's the important thing. Get better. Get healthy. Our carl of all trades of the show. Carls says yellow paperwork. Job hunt continues.
Fill out an application for a job at the district that I previously applied for a director position at. Then took an online pedagogy test sent to me. This is for a programming teacher position, but I'm still emotionally unsure about my profession for both internal and external factors.
I did not have much of a chance to look or apply for other jobs. Hey, I think that's okay. I'm glad to hear that you are at least giving things thoughts. And I hope that you'll come to a good conclusion with that.
Our identical to one of the show errands says connection check made good progress on freelancing priorities and had a nice chat today to ensure that we have expectations set right with the client as well. Wonderful. I love that.
I'm going to need to learn how to become a good consultant just like you. Our robotics engineer of the show Aiden says I made the appointment connection check was the car and got the work done. Did it fix the problem? No, but that's a separate issue. Okay.
You know, that does happen and that do be happening. Then our profane sleeper of the show Mike said the biggest red X other ever I got nothing done and spent all the trip money. Oh, no. Hopefully we'll be able to get it all figured out soon, soon, soon.
Our Esperanto nitter of the show, Eris Anya says a ball of yarn and a sock. I survived the polyglot gathering and knitted socks. I finished three pairs and started my fourth saw amazing talks one in Italian and Mexican sign language. Neither of which I speak.
I was going to ask a lot of questions, but okay, those got answered. And I met some friends I hadn't seen in a while. I have ideas for talks I could do next year. And I wrote them down not to forget them. Oh my goodness.
I wonder and hope that bang bang, bang, is still around and if so that I would love for you to maybe consider taking that talk there as well. Our soprano of the show, Debo said green heart sorting and organized one drawer of clothing. Way to go, Debo. Our shark of the show one pair of shoes.
Whose name I can. Oh, Chris said my connection. Oh, never mind. That's just for next time. So apparently we didn't have one there, but that's okay. We'll get you back on the the real. And the ah of the show, ah, says my trip has been planned.
Not everything is booked, but at least I know where I'm supposed to be at and when. That is super, super awesome. And hopefully we hear more about your upcoming trip. All right. This episode of condo is brought to you by micro.blog. Blogging is still the easiest way to share stuff on the web.

Thanks to micro.blog for the support of the show and all of relay. Okay, Jay. So did we decide on this? We talked about this topic. I think in co-working. Yeah. Yeah. So we have this idea. I wish I could remember where it came up, but possibly co-working. And if not, that's fine too.
Basically, we wanted to discuss privilege. Right now, you know, there's a lot. There's a lot going on. And I know, Jay, when we started this show, I wanted, I know I personally wanted to make sure that I had a little bit of diversity in my co-host.
And being friends with you just kind of worked out that I was like, oh yay! I get to talk to somebody that is a minority as well. And we get to have kind of these different perspectives. But we also both have a lot of privilege too.
 It can be difficult sometimes to acknowledge privilege when, especially if you're feeling extremely, like, if you're feeling like the world doesn't care about you, or society thinks you don't matter, it can be difficult sometimes to not concentrate on all of the bad things in life, and not necessarily like recognize the privilege that's going on.
I think it's kind of where I'm sitting with this. And so also, I want to say this is, you know, this is going to be a difficult conversation to possibly hear. So I'm going to struggle with making sure I'm saying the correct things too.
I'm not because if I get canceled, not to get canceled, but I don't want to offend people that matter. You know, anyways.
I would say that in a world where like, I'm trying to think of like the phrasing, I've heard before, like, I think the best words that I've been told were, if the world is out to get you, be glad that it hasn't caught you yet.
Like, there's that level of like, you know, understand that yes, it might suck. And it probably does suck for someone a little bit more. And oh my gosh, like, I bumped into that like face first. The other day, where, you know, I guess, I can, I'm not going into too much detail.
I was in a call with a friend and we were body doubling and doing like the ADHD thing. And like, that was great. And there were people in the call that I didn't know. And, you know, there's, there is this moment where like, there was some chest puffery in there of like, oh, well, friend of friend.
This is, you know, where I, this is where I sit in the world. And they were like, oh, well, yeah, you're very, very new to this space. And it was like, well, how dare you, you know, let me talk about my bonafides, my bonafide days. I don't know how to say the word because I usually just read it.
Okay. But then, not the second time. But like in that moment, that person was actually kind of, I don't want to say lashing out because again, I can't speak for them.
But they were very upset with the privilege that I had gotten of being as new as I was in my career, which again, I'm not, I haven't been around the block a little bit, but they've been there significantly longer.
And they had been struggling with getting employed and finding a job, you know, in the current, you know, market and industry and all this other stuff. But there was this moment where I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, like I've had it hard too, but also like, I'm hot stuff.
And they were like, oh, well, I'm glad the world is, you know, easy for you. And I like, in that moment, I'm just like, oh, dang, like the challenges that make others more privileged than one another are not always visible.
And that's the perfect time to just step right right into it when you're not taking that into account. Yeah, because everyone has a little bit of something to not necessarily like pay attention to, but also to, yes, pay attention to.
No matter how difficult your life is, there's somebody that always has at worst, which I'm not saying this in a you should be happy with what you have type of a way because I would net that is not.
That is never my situation so much as you can be going through a difficult time and still acknowledge or recognize the luck and privilege and and joy.
In the life that you're living and sometimes I know when I'm having a really, really hard time when I feel like everything is just hitting hard sometimes that helps. To sit and acknowledge, you know, the basic fundamentals of the privileges that I have.
And it can be stuff as simple as my parents are still married and they have an amazing relationship that growing up allowed me to have.
You know, the privilege of knowing what a loving relationship is and to know the boundaries that I want to set for not just romantic relationships when I was, you know, looking for a spouse, but for friendships and.
 And acknowledging that basic privilege that I have to know when it's okay to say no to people on top of everything, you know, being white, being raised with parents that were solid middle class, having an opportunity to, you know, work from home having an incredible child who has so much self-respect.
 So much self-reliance and desire to go to school to do their homework to get good grades to all of these things that I am really lucky and privileged to have that it, it helps not to focus too much on the fact that yeah, I have a spouse who is fully disabled and that affects significantly things in my life.
My financial situation is not super great. It's not, you know, do I wish it could be better? Yes, and I'm working towards that, but I also was lucky enough in the fact that, you know, because I gave birth to another person's human being, we were able to financially afford a house.
So we own a house now and that's a huge privilege. Like all of these things can balance out and that means that I'm not going to be able to do that. So that's what I'm going to do now and that makes what my life is. And, yeah, I'm really.
But it can be difficult when you're having a conversation with somebody I think who, either whether and good intentions are not maybe comes to like poke at privilege, it can be really easy to be like, oh, and get defensive.
So, I think that's a way, all of the ways that you're not privileged in a way to kind of balance out in that reactionary state.
When a lot of times it comes from, I feel like it can come from a sense of their own unhappiness and the person might want to make themselves feel a little bit better kind of in that bullying situation. Sometimes can just be, I want to make sure that you know what you're doing.
Like, how could you have it type of a thing? And so it's a difficult, it's, man, it's hard being a human. Yeah. Well, and there is that, there is that desire to, I don't want to say always look on the bright side of life, cue the, cue the whistling. But like, there is the two sides of it.
There is the like, I want, I don't want the people around me to see me maybe in a position where I feel like I'm in a low spot. But then there's also the like, I don't want necessarily a people's pity either. And that's, that is, that is like such a hard, that's a hard thing to balance.
You know, a great example of this. I have, you know, we've talked about this at kind of ad nauseam, like I have, I have gone through a few jobs while being with condo it. And when I say like the, the growth, just the financial stability going from job one to job three has been significant.
And there have definitely been moments where like that has changed the conversation in many ways. And this was, this was a, you know, there's an episode of over tired that I did with Christina Warren and Brett, to her, to her, to her, to her.
And then we talked about this, we talked about like, how do you handle being the first person in your family to say like, hey, financially, like if we're living check to check, we're living check to check because we're making poor financial decisions, not, that's just how much we're making.
And it changes the landscape and there are cultural ties that come with that. There are, you know, I can, I have friends who probably make more than me, but have less of it to live on because culturally they're expected to provide for them and their entire family.
And that includes their extended family, not just them, they're in loss. They have different work situations. Brittany doesn't work a full time job. Brittany is a full time volunteer where she goes and she helps out at the animal shelter. And that's a thing that we're able to do and sustain.
But I think in doing that, it comes with its own issues, its own anxieties. And that doesn't mean that my life is easier or harder than anyone else's. It just means it's my life.
And I think that that is, to me, the thing that I would want people to understand more or less about privilege is that like just just because like there, I don't, I don't want to look at it from more privileged, less privileged. I want to look at it from being like privileged in different ways.
And there might be people who have quote unquote more, more privileged than I do. And, you know, congratulations to those people. But I also know of people who are incredibly wealthy and have horrible substance abuse problems or have horrible mental health issues.
And in my mind, I'm like, do I really feel like they're more privileged than I am that they can, they can sure they can buy whatever they want. But then also they go to sleep at night, like not happy at all. That again, it is, it's hard to tell. It's hard to gauge. Yeah. It's a scale.
And there's no solid like a final answer really. Like there's no, it's always moving around. And it's something that you can only really do yourself. You can't necessarily judge other people's privilege.
And I don't think it's, and this is where it becomes difficult because there's a lot of times people are aware of the privilege that they might have.
And if you're in a place that you can, you know, help and support being able to, you know, contribute some information about, hey, you're, you're, you're white. You live in it. I am city that has not you, you live in a city that has access to clean water.
There's always, there's always some sort of like safe conversation that you can have. I think with people that you're, when they call in the national guard, they don't just arrest you because you were in the area and you look like a suspect.
Yeah, or they don't try and deport you because they think, you know, like you're undocumented, you know, this, this is, there's so many layers in here. And it can be difficult to like, oh, well, I'm going to tell everybody, make sure that they know, you know, what's going on.
Like, yeah, so you got to, you do have to make sure that you're taking care of yourself in a way too. You can't just, there's, there's, you don't need to be the one making sure everyone knows that they're with their privileges.
And identifying that, that's something that doesn't necessarily, if you're identifying other people's privileges, you are wrong. You're wrong. Yeah. Sorry.
 But if somebody, you know, helping, helping them recognize privilege, if they're a friend of yours and they're just like, you know, oh, man, I don't, gosh, I don't even know what this conversation would have would be like, but I've definitely like talk to friends that have maybe made derogatory comments.
And I'm like, hey, that comes from a place of privilege. Like, let's talk about this a little bit. But again, only in safe places and only with a level of care for myself, because I also have a privilege in that I have family to take care of. And so I can't just run around and, and do things.
And, and that's part of, you know, the world that we live in, in the United States. Well, and not just in the United States, but in other places too, is, it's going through a difficult time right now.
And a lot of times you can, I don't know about you, Jay, but there are times when I like see things like protest going on. And I'm like, I wish that I was in a place that I could contribute my voice to that.
However, I know for many reasons that is not the best way for me to contribute my time of her and energy, because if I was in jail, it would be really difficult for my family to proceed to be where they're at.
And so I'm able to contribute in other ways and acknowledge that even though my heart is like, oh, let me, let me, you know, protest my specifically right now in LA, the protest against ice right now is what's what's front of mind. I have many friends in LA. Same and family in LA.
Yeah, you're even closer. Yeah. And like, I wish that I could be there supporting that, but I can't. And so trying to find ways to contribute and support them and their efforts in a way that works for me and my family.
I think one of the things that's interesting about this is I see two, two kind of glaring questions. And one of those things is like, how do I, how do I use my privilege or how do I make a difference in spite of being less privileged than others.
 But then the other is like, how do I support those that are maybe in a situation that would be considered, you know, less privileged without it being one without making yourself a target, because I do think that there is, there is like a self preservation thing like you said, Kathy of like, yeah, going and protesting is fine until you're in jail.
And then like all of a sudden now there are very serious issues involved, but like the other side of that is some is, is like sending a tweet ever good enough.
And I mean, I'm not here to tell you that the answer is no, but I would, I would tell you that probably talking to someone in person is probably going to be more advantageous to the thing that's sweet and probably better for your mental health.
And sending, sending letters or calling your representatives or donating to money to places that are doing the work that you want to support.
 And that's that's kind of the piece that I can specifically talk to, being being a founder of an organization that predominantly exists to support under like historically excluded people in tech communities, especially like the Python community like sitting on a panel, a few weeks ago at this point now, the conversation was very much tied to this.
It was with all the government policy saying if you do this, you lose the opportunity for government funding. If you do this, you lose the opportunity like there are going to be companies that will not work with you because they are afraid of backlash.
If you speak loudly about the people that you're helping, literally the government will like will protect and uphold lawsuits that will force you to stop doing what you're doing. Like we move differently now in 2025 than we did in 2024.
 And the problem with that is that unlike some other communities and really the reality is it doesn't matter how much money any of these communities make, I've seen lots of communities that had a lot more money, a lot bigger sponsors have to shut down because of just rapid changes that hit them too quickly.
But there are so many people that don't understand we operate on a year, it used to be 1.3 months. And honestly, when I was all the videos from the thing that I did tell us say 1.3 months, we just reviewed our budget. It's one year.
So we operate on one year's budget, which means at any given time, if we make no more money, then we have exactly one year of support that we can provide before we go out of business.
And that is with everybody being a volunteer, that is with people losing jobs, finding new jobs, having to find new jobs, starting new jobs, having to be involved in all those things.
That is even when the leader of the organization whose name might or might not be J Miller almost accidentally puts everything at risk by putting, you know, having their credit card, number stolen. And like, no, yes.
So like there are so many other stresses and things that you don't understand how much a $5 donation really does help. Like and Kathy and I have talked about this. We are incredibly privileged to have superconductors that love this show. And there are we love you. We love you.
There are things that we've done only because this show exists. I have gone to other countries and gotten to me amazing people only because this show exists. And there are days where I am looking at the calendar. I'm looking at all the meetings that I have.
I look at the like stress of am I going to lose my job or not. And then I think about the like comfort that I'm in of like, well, doing this is incredibly worth it because when I do get to like read off those connection checks, it is a reminder of like J sometimes life sucks a little bit.
But in this moment, you've got people around you who are like wanting you to give them 30 minutes or a sentence of recognition of that like they are doing a thing that sucks more right now. Yeah. Like don't don't tweet. Like if you see someone who's there situation. Yeah, don't tweet at all.
If you see someone whose situation just kind of sucks. Like it I think that it is okay to acknowledge that like, hey, it might suck and I see you.
If I could help you in any way, please let me know and let people know what your capacity is and I'm sure that they will be able to work around it because I can tell you there was there was a time where I had two people that helped me when I was in between jobs.
I didn't know when my job was going to start. I had no way of knowing and like there were zero questions asked about it and they were just like take this money, take care of your family and like don't worry about it.
And like I will say that that was so important for me because it reminded me that like, yes, my life sucks, but I have people around me who even though they can't fix the problem, they can make it suck just a little bit less. Yeah. Yeah.
And that's a that's a major privilege to is having a community around you. Yeah. Having the people. Yeah. I know I feel extremely lucky with that. But there are people who take that who just like take that. I want to say for granted, who take that and don't like appreciate it at all. Yeah.
And that's sad. And it makes me sad that it doesn't it doesn't sit. It doesn't you know, it's not necessarily something that's being recognized and and seen as a really good lucky thing.
And obviously it's not necessarily luck in that you have to do some work to keep it to keep the connections and keep the friendships going and whatnot. But having even one person in your life that you can talk to and go to if you need help, etc. is really special.
And I think that's a lot of people who are really happy with that. And I think that's a lot of people who are happy with that. And I think that's a lot of people who are happy with that. And I think that's a lot of people who are happy with that.

 But allow me, allow this show, allow, you know, what we do at relay, allow us to be that little bit of like, well, at least I have this community, at least I have these friends who are going to offer me advice and who are going to listen to the challenges that I have and consider them when they're offering up suggestions.
Yeah, agreed. Man, we're really lucky. Yeah. You have a, I'm so, also freaking awesome. Well, that is, that is very true. Some of us more than others. And I will let the audience figure out who I'm talking about. It's, it's Kathy. Kathy is, Kathy's answer.
Like, what are you, like, what are you talking about Kathy? For those that don't know, my, my role in here is to keep Kathy slightly, like, mentally unstable, just long enough that like, something revelational can, like, come up.
Kathy will say something and it'll literally foundationally change how I think about a topic. And the only way I can make that happen is by slowly pissing her off. Oh, my goodness. That sounds so terrible. But you know what? I'll take it, I guess. That's what friends are for.
Like you're not like some friends you have in life just because it reminds you of privilege you are. Oh, goodness. Well, it's really, really hot in my office. So I want to, let's, let's keep moving on. It's a privilege to have a roof over my head.
And one of these days I will be privileged enough to have air conditioning in my house. But right now that's not, it's not true. And it is currently, let's see. I got to, I got to look at carrot, whether because it will do the conversion for me. All right.
It is currently 94 degrees in Fahrenheit, which means it is Celsius 34. That is gross. Which is really gross. I mean, I live in a human and muggy place and that is gross. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, it's not fun. So I'm sorry if you can hear a fan.
In the audio, we're going to do our best to take it out. But yeah, it's a, yeah, not, not, hanging in there. But this episode of Conduette is brought to you by our friends at vitally. Vitally is bringing in a new era for customer service productivity with their all-in-one platform.

OK, Jay, what is your connection? My connection is going to be to. This is going to sound weird, but I'm follow along with me. My connection is going to be to cancel my cleaning service subscription.
And the reason that we're doing that is one we have someone that comes and cleans the house or help you know they clean the house like every other week. Which is great because we have allergies and we have shedding dogs.
So it's like we hold we hold it off and then someone comes in and does a really good job. And I'm very privileged that I'm capable to do that that I can we can afford to do that. The problem is we signed up through a service and the service makes things a little more complicated.
And then it needs to be because it's like hey, if that person needs to like reschedule all of a sudden or something happens or they're late or whatever. Then like now we have this weird issue where like we've already paid the service and like stuff hasn't happened.
And that's that's a pain in the butt to deal with. And the thing is we really like the person that comes in like cleans and we're willing to like work with them and work with their schedule and things like that.
And honestly, if they if we paid like the same amount just directly to them then they would make more money. So like they were even like oh well I'll just give you I'll just pay you what I'm making from the cleaning company.
And I'm just like or we could just pay you what we're what we've already budgeted to pay you and you can just make more money. That's nice too. But also like all of that to say we were locked into a one year commitment at that level.
And then now we're we're at we're approaching and we will have approached it by next con.
 And then we're going to have a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of an a bit of a deal so in the beginning.
My opinion is that we might have to deposit the amount of money so if we don't rah ed, the amount of money that we have to take. canceled, but I don't think that I can technically cancel on the date that we record without taking a penalty. I will look into it and I will cancel if I can. Okay.
That's that'll be do you want to have it be next? The next conduit? Oh, no, because if I wait another two weeks, then I've done something wrong. So I will definitely say look into and hopefully cancel cleaning subscription. And again, that doesn't cancel the cleaning.
It just cancels the subscription through the service. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, that makes sense. What about you, Kathy? I am going to just repeat last Fortnite connection because this is my life and I can do that. I'm going to clean my desk for reels. For Instagram. For Instagram. Sure.
You heard it here. The best. Yeah. The good news is is that I, it's only going to be in the 70s this next week. So totally way more doable to be in my office. So I will do that. If Kathy doesn't do it, then she has to do an Instagram reel. That's what I heard. Okay. Sure. Sounds good.
What about our connectors? The Oracle of the show. Sof says next connection. It's conference season. So I'm about to be driving around the country for work a lot. This is when I usually forget to eat regularly. So I'll be aiming to eat lunch five out of the seven days. Ooh, me too.
That is such a great, great connection. Tech podcast listener of the show. Pillix says install the AC and change the brake pads on my car. I need to go and buy foam to put around my window for the AC and buy brake pads for my car. Okay. I got you. I got you. I got you. Best of luck with that.
Our doll of the show, Molly says next week, get an incredibly basic personal website set up and hosted. I already got the infrastructure for it set up. All that's left is typing out a couple of pages and deploying it. Hey, that sounds really, really fun. Best of luck with that.
Love to share the link with us if you want to share it in the future. Our checklist enthusiast of the show, Mike says keep working on personal projects list. Not very exciting, but I think I can get a lot more done in another conduit. Sounds like you got a lot of checklist to enthuse about.
Our code monkey of the show Douglas says continue on the path to simplification and figure out why the health issues are flaring up again. Yes, please, please, please get well soon. The Carle of all trades of the show Carl says it is the summer. So I like to brush up on my swift programming skills.
So while I try to restart my progress in the 100 days of SwiftUI, I got distracted by a shiny API called Sprite Kit. So by next connection, I am going to draw a simple Sprite sheet to import into a test app to play around with Sprite Kit. That sounds really, really fun.
I can't wait to find the conduit game that you wind up making down the road. Our identical twin of the show, Aaron says with a half marathon coming up in October, I want to make sure I get a long slow run in each week. I think that'd be great.
Our robotics engineer of the show, Aiden says get ready for girlfriend's convocation later this week. Best of luck. Our profane sleep, I don't know what a convocation is. So I'm hoping that is a best of luck scenario. Oh, yeah, best of luck, best of luck. This will be, this should be great.
Had I gone to college, I would probably know a convocation was our profane sleeper of the show. Mike says still trying to work on sitting still long enough to relax and play some games. Stop what you're doing. Go play some games unless you can. Then I'm sorry.
The Esperanto Nitter of the show says I will go home two days. So for the next connection, it's more knitting and chocolate eating while I recover from an intense language filled event. Oh, that sounds really, really fun.
The soprano of the show, Debo says shorten the hem of a blouse that's too long. Getting in the stitch on. I like it. Our shark of the show, Chris says my connection for next time is to get my office cleaned up. It has been a decaying space of chaos for the next past for the past couple of months.
And I need to make it a space of peace again. Ah, but I love the chaos, but the piece is probably good too. And the awe of the show, ah, says I leave for Thailand in two weeks. So I've got to be completely prepared for my trip. I need to get fully booked and fully packed.
I mean, you got three weeks or two weeks. But if you're like me, then that'll become one week pretty quickly. So yeah, maybe we get on that. Hey, thanks for a jump, letting me do this for y'all. And I hope you'll have a good rest of the conduit. Okay.
