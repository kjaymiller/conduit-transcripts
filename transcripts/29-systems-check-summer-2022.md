From really FM, you're listening to Conduit, the show where we conduo our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that is down with the systems. I'm Kathy and I'm here with my not from Concentrate, Co-host Jay. Hi, Jing. Fresh squeeze all the time.
Oh my goodness, we are on the last episode over 20s. Happy almost birthday. I don't know we're going with that. Let's head over to our shout outs.
Jay, do you have a shout out? Yeah, I got a couple shout out to a new friend that I've made, Jen Jnod, who does a Twitter space every Wednesday around tech and mental health. Two things that I'm a part of. Or that I have to think about regularly.
I attended their Twitter space last week and it was great and I would be attending the one today, but I'm recording a show. So I wanted to just give them a shout out because we talked about a lot of stuff and Conduit came up and they were excited to hear about that.
But also there are other podcasters that are talking about things like mental health, especially in the tech space that I get to now talk to on a regular basis, which means hopefully, when I talk about it here, it'll sound smarter. Yeah, you always sound smart when you talk with me. No, smarter.
Oh, smarter. Okay, well, there you go.
What about you?
 I want to start with a shout out to a friend of the show and friend of the Discord water Brian, who recently got a diagnosis of ADHD and they wanted to thank this show and us and the hashtag break room for the support of like being authentic, and I want to tell you something about what you're doing and what you're doing in a way that allows you to kind of recognize features of yourself.
And I also thanks to the sport of the of you and others like being able to recognize things that aren't neurotypical to get like some guidance and be able to answer an answer. And ask the questions to get to a place that is really productive in healthy, journey type of a thing. That make any sense.
I don't know. I feel like it's one of those days because my second shout out is to hashtag break room for there's giving me more support than my back did yesterday, which is why this show is not recorded live. I'm like our normal episodes because my back decided it wanted to no longer support me.
Welcome to my 40s apparently. Oh, no, you mean your 29s. Oh, yeah. So 29. Yeah. So this show were the back pain begins. Oh, no. But I fully, I don't even know the words like I have the emotions, the supportive emotions, the happy emotions, the let me know what you need emotions for water, Brian.
For me, getting my diagnosis was like a relief because it told me that my brain wasn't broken. It just worked slightly different.
But I understand that for everyone, like it impacts people differently and I don't water, Brian, if you need some direct support or like conversation or whatever, just DM me and discord. And I'm, but other than that, I'm just here to celebrate to miss a rate and whatever rate with you, however you.
Yeah. Yeah. It's interesting how much the pandemic has helped with guidance in these types of things by, by having everyone kind of slow down and take some time to think in ways. It's been pretty beneficial, I think. For a lot of people, I know that I definitely wouldn't have gotten on my journey.
If I hadn't started therapy that it then became a concentration that that whole journey, you know, tumbling down.
And I love the supportive community that I've seen with people that are diagnosed with ADHD and being able to recognize signs in each other and be like, oh, yeah, I totally have that hyper fixation.
And then easily distracted and all of all of the little things that, you know, they make the comments and the comics and the jokes and the things about that hit really, really, really real. So yeah, it's, but it's interesting. Yeah.
If you haven't caught on to a theme yet for the show, we're not necessarily going to be spending a lot of time around mental health. And let's say comes up in our connection, but we are going to be kind of catching up with one another and seeing where we're at this, this week.
But before we do that, I did have one more shout out shout out to all of my friends right now in Kansas City. I had so many people message me asking me if I was going to be there. There's an event called KCDC that normally happens this time of year.
And sadly, I wasn't able to go, but that also means that I'm here to record conduit. But special shout out to my friend, Reselle, who actually messaged me saying, oh, hey, by the way, I listened to conduit and I absolutely love it. By the way, I'm in Kansas City. Are you here? Oh, oh, oh.
Alas, no, you're here with me instead. Oh goodness. Well, we love all of our really FM members, but especially the ones that are in our discord, extra love for them. It's a great community. So you hang out with other like-minded fans of the network.
We also record this show live almost every fortnight, and you can hang out in the chat with us while we do the show and interact as well as be exposed to some of our behind the scenes. Shamanigans. If you want to join us, you can become a member at relay.
fm slash conduit and be able to support J and I directly. But until then, Jay, let's head on over to our connection chat. Zap. How did you do this fortnight, Jay? So I've been back from traveling for a few weeks. I am four weeks away from the next big trip, which is a big trip.
So my connection last week was to expand on my paper system. And I think we're going to be talking about this a little bit more later. But I totally did it. I now have kind of a layout and format of how things are high like things.
And it's still evolving a little bit, but it's starting to come together. And I started, I spent some money to start archiving some of the old pages and documents. And the silksonic system. That way, if I still need them, I can refer to them as well. Nice.
Can't we to hear more about it? So would you say that you have a big green check mark? I would say something around big green checks. Sure. I don't know. I am harder on myself than than people tend to be. I will say that I have a green check. Even though I know it's going to be a work in progress.
Yeah, but it always is a work in progress. And I think by recognizing that, that means that yes, you did expand your paper system. And you made adjustments. And so yes, it's not finished, but your connection has been checked. Yeah. What about you? I also have a big green check mark.
And with no qualifications, I did my morning, me time every day, even on the weekends. And it was phenomenal, especially as the mornings became a little bit chillier, which was glorious. Yesterday morning, I even had, like, it had just rained the day, but like, then overnight.
And I was like, what was that extra good smelling outside? It was lovely. I documented almost every day on my Instagram. In my Instagram stories, where I do kind of a good morning. Post just kind of get myself ready for the day. And it was really nice to see Ophelia, the puppy.
And I realized that I was going to be sitting still for a little bit. And she would run around and then eventually come and sit on my lap and wiggle, wiggle, wiggle to get into position and then settle down. And usually by the end of my writing, the cat would come out too.
So at most mornings, I would have a cat and a dog on my lap, which made it really hard to get out of my very comfy outdoor seat. To come inside and work, but it did mean that I had plenty of time to do my brain dumping as well.
And I can't wait to talk about my adjustment on the topic leader today as well. And what that, what that change has done to my entire system. But until then, let's hear about our conductors connections. How about that? I like it.
So our first one goes to Deborah, our soprano of the show, who says, I've made good progress sitting up my new MacBook Air. It's so much faster than the 2013 MacBook Pro. It's replacing. Yes, I know that feeling. I recently received my M2 and it is faster and it is also an M whatever would.
It's funny because we're two years into this process and I still have things that are broken because they're like, Oh, you know, support the new system. Like it makes me mad. But anyway, this isn't about me. It's about Deborah. I'm glad that you con did it. All right.
Next up, our blue dragon of the show sky has a blue heart, which we all know means a green heart. Besides some last minute things packing is almost done. Turns out packing up your entire life into a few boxes is a good workout.
Yeah, that sounds like a very good workout and also kind of helpful to kind of cleanse junk out of your life. I can imagine as well. So well done sky. Speaking of workouts, I need to go put my Apple watch on. I'll be right back. Okay, I'm back. I'm kidding. I didn't go anywhere.
Our next person, our next conductor is God, our guitarist of the show who says connection check packing is almost done. My wife is finishing because she's a rock star that recognized how bad the move was affecting my mental health. See, we're back here.
Also, I had my third interview for a potential new job now just waiting to hear back from the company job watch. Okay. By the way, we learned that there is some ongoing themes. So I might just randomly shot watches. Uh huh. Okay, get ready for the watch for this next one.
The nameless of the show Robert has a yellow piece of cheese. That sounds good. Um, he didn't post his graduation pictures, but did buy some prints to put up of him and his fiance's new place. Oh, put up at him and his fiance's new place, not photos of the place.
That's my bad, not Robert's writing. He did start following up with guests, getting them to respond is another thing. Yes, absolutely. And he did get his own system off the ground for his tasks.
I can't wait to hear more about it in the discord, please hang out in hashtag systems and themes and let us know a little bit more about your system because as you will be able to tell later on in the show love systems love hearing about them.
I'm obsessed and it's also really helpful to learn how other people do things to get more reasons on to why you do your own things isn't a wedding just a love system. Oh, wow. Where's your, where's your wedding watch shout wedding watch.
Our slot of the show, Ankenus says a green book while I had less time and energy due to work through the fortnight and didn't get things as nice as I'd hope. I got my force painted like what? But there are many the miniatures, the little oh, okay, yeah, yeah game watch.
This is going to get annoying quick. I'm going to stop now. Okay, trying that again, leave all this in, Javier. And thank you.
While I had less time and energy due to work through the fortnight and didn't get things as nice as I'd hope I got the force painted well enough for the game and got the first session in yesterday and eat out a hard fought win way to go.
All right, connections that are like, hey, this is for my fun. Yes, can I have dedicated focus on fun things? Absolutely. I love, I love forcing fun kind of, but concentrating on it, having it be a part of, you know, life and existing and that's really important. All right, our Oracle of the show.
So their book came out and then they got the biggest waffle with ice cream and whipped cream. You have ever seen it was hard work, but they con did it. Heck, yeah, they con did so proud of the waffle ice cream deliciousness.
I really wanted some of that, but more importantly that the book is ready for pre order. Don't worry. The link will be in the show notes. If you want to learn a little bit more about disability in churches, this looks like an incredible book and I can't wait to read it.
I just want to say I guess you can close the chapter on this one. Really? Jamba, the hello of the show says a green box. Been a busy two weeks with wedding planning wedding watch. We managed to get see this is not going to end. I know you said you were going to stop.
We managed to get our rings sorted and some of some of the valves sorted. We met with our wedding planner, which added a bit of stress on what was left last week. I think it took like 50% of the stuff off. So great. And also just in a side, I have ADHD. I can't let some things go.
But congratulations on getting halfway there, Jamba. You got this. Rayal Z. The train enthusiast of the show has a green circle question mark. He did exist. He is moving towards his goals, but got denied for a job at the dream company. They are just not ready for me yet.
So he's going closer to home and applying for another post grad role. I love that framing of it. That yeah, your dream company just isn't ready for it for you. I hope that you're able to get a job that ends up being really positive and hopeful and happy and all of that.
And I'm proud of you for existing and being here and showing up. I will just say that the role that I'm in today, I first, like the exact role that I'm in today. I first applied for four years ago. So I totally get the like they're not ready for me yet.
And just because I mean, if it's a dream company and it's like a no right now, that's not no forever. So you got this and I'm glad that you haven't, you know, like I said, you have the right perspective on this and this isn't. It's not even a set back. It's just it's a step in the journey.
Absolutely. Our panda of the show James says connection check green check mark. I've been a lot better at listening to my body and stopping work when it starts to complain at me. Not perfect every day, but I still consider it good progress.
And I will try to keep up with that as the pressure mounts towards next month's deadlines. I've had a friendly unicorn keeping an eye on me, which has helped. I just want to say I have a coworker in Australia that tells me to stop working.
When they're done with work, I should have been done almost eight hours ago. So I needed to hear this. I'm glad that there are people who are starting to think about restraint in the things that they're doing work wise, especially when you enjoy what you do.
I know James really enjoys the work that he does. And just being able to say this is fun. I should stop like that. That's a really, really. I don't want to say mature because we're all adults here, but like that's a that's a very wise thing to do. Agreed 100% and I'm really proud of James.
In case you couldn't tell I'm that friendly unicorn. I was going to ask this like where's everybody finding all these unicorns at like it's your co-hosts of course. But when I we have we have timing down and I've been really proud that usually by my lunchtime.
He's either taken a break or is getting to the point where he's how working towards taking a break. And by dinner time, it's time for him to go to bed. And it's been helpful for me as well to check in on somebody else because it allows me to check in on myself.
But it also is a reminder for me that hey, how you feeling, how you doing, what's going on. And it's a good it's a good balance. And I really appreciate it. I'm so proud of the show Kate says I've kept working on the uni work and I'm getting there a bit by bit. Not long left to go now.
So I'm almost there. I know this journey has been so difficult and so hard to do, but Kate, we are so proud of you. And you can do this. Yeah, you're gone. All right. So it's time for our main topic where we're going to chat about our system.
So we realized that both of us had had fairly significant changes into what we do from our pre our first episode where we talked about our systems.
And so we kind of just like loosely decided, even though it's the middle of an official quarter, we're going to do quarterly check ins, ish maybe or at the very least when significant things have changed in our systems in our lives and how we do things.
It's important to check in not just for our own accountability and like a record and conversations with our audience. But it's useful to remember that systems change.
And making adjustments is good because it means you're adapting to whatever situation it you're in, how your brain is working, what your days are like. All of that and I really, really appreciate that idea. So come along on our journey as we check in on our systems.
So when we talked about this like, or I guess as you were explaining kind of this process, it reminded me of kind of two. Corporate business, things that are in existence, technically three. The first one are just performance reviews like these are things that we all dread.
And I think we dread them often because they happen like once a year. And it's like this, this whole like, how do I wrap up? How well or not so well? I did the entire year. So my suggestion with that is you should do them more than once a year.
And also they shouldn't be these big things that are like indicative of whether or not you get raises and things like that. It should just be like, hey, am I on the right track? And I feel like that's what we're doing with our systems.
Like the last few weeks, a lot of changes came because what we noticed was our systems weren't doing the things that we originally designed them for. Like maybe they weren't having the same outcome that we were hoping for. And that's kind of the other parts of that.
It's called an OKR or an objective in key result, which is like, hey, this is like my goal or my theme for this period of time. This is what I'm hoping, you know, softly, what will happen.
And then the other one is like a KPI, which is like a key performance indicator, which is the hard like this number of things done, this number of widgets cranked by like this time. Like, and I don't think that really works here.
But I do think the first two, kind of that performance review and OKR definitely come into play. And it is my system continuing to move me in the direction that I want to be moved or moving in. So Kathy, has your system moving you? Yes, my system is moving and changing and adjusting.
Oh my goodness, it's so different than it was a year ago with some intermediate steps in between. And I definitely am seeing some potential additional changes. And I think that the pieces of it have been like incrementally been adjusting over this entire year.
So right now, because of course, again, I expect it to change in the future, especially because part of my system is very fresh. But my morning me time, I have, I'm writing, you know, journaling, just writing down what's in my brain for thoughts.
But then I also, so my notebook has like a back pocket. And I have a field notes that is tucked in the cover of it is tucked into the pocket so that I can open it up. And I have like that page that I'm writing on be there.
So I don't have to like search or find or anything, which means that it's upside down because the of the direction of the pocket. So what I do is I'll write my journal and then I flip my notebook over and brain dump tasks.
And then I use that need to get done or should get done or I want to get done, etc. Then when I come inside, I sit down and instead of using the piece of paper that I've used in the past, I've started using my iPad mini.
Used to have my iPad pro live on my desk, but it was so big, which I loved that I wouldn't bring it out. So I realized that, oh my gosh, I have this mini that had been living by my dad, by my bed, why wouldn't I have the little one on my desk like that just duh. So I've been using for now.
So I use notability for notes with my clients. Because of the infinity pages, I just can write it down and it's all in one document and it's easy to use. So for my morning, like to do list, I've started using just a single good notes page and then I just erase the date and anything that got done.
So I have tasks that maybe were from the day before that are still there that I haven't done yet. So to rewrite what needs to be done, it stays in the page.
And I've pulled those things out from my brain dump in the field notes and they live just in that good notes page and that's where they live, which it's easy to view, because I can just turn on my iPad and it's there.
And I also easy to keep it away when I'm working and focusing on a specific project. And in this, this world of loose, you know, adjustments and changes to my system, I am slowly working on possibly having to do is be a digital task management.
And I'm really looking forward to having a new task that is going to be done right now. And I'm looking forward to having a new task that is going to be done right now. Very loosely playing with that, but I think something like that might work.
And the reason I'm using to do is is because I already had it previously set up before I stopped using it. So it has all of my clients as folders and tags and that sort of stuff already situated. So it's easy to add things to the inbox and just blog, blog, blog, it in there.
And then I can sort it out when I have a chance usually at the end of the day when I'm starting to wind down and I'm like, I need to feel like I'm productive, but not actually have the energy to do anything. So I can just sort things that are in my inbox.
And because it's not super time time sensitive, it's okay that it gets sorted later in the day. So I have so many questions. Let's start with me time. One is this a protected time.
I don't want to spill all the beans, but Kathy and I have this thing where we wind up texting each other at like seven in the morning, like with regularity, more regularity than probably should exist. And I want to make sure one I'm not invading me time.
If if me time is supposed to be in that time, I want to make sure that one, you, you like obviously have permission to just ignore me, but then also you shouldn't have to ignore me if I know that that's your meat. So yeah, is me time protected. Yes, I actually have set up a focus.
Well, I put it on do not disturb right now, but I'm working on doing a focus type thing possibly, but I play. I use, you know, some ambient noise and soft music, things while I'm doing it playing with different apps.
So I don't ruin my Spotify algorithm, which is what it had been for a while trying to find something that works with my brain. So that'll be updated. But yes, I put it on focus mode. So I don't reply.
 If I'm in the middle of that or if I'm towards like the beginning of it is when it's really, really deeply focused and then when I'm like, dilly dallying at the end of it because I don't want to leave the pets on my lap, then I'll turn off focus mode so that I can start like spreading into the day.
If that makes sense. Yes, and that actually segues really well into the second part of this, which is so you have this continuous view of what was happening before. And then you're also doing like this morning brain dump. Do these like invade each other at all.
Like I know that some people prefer to do like there. We'll call it a review. They're morning review or their weekly review or whatever. Some people do it at the beginning of the week or the morning. Some people do it at the end of the day or at the end of the week.
Do you feel like having it in the morning helps because you already have this continuous view of what was happening before or do you think that maybe having it in the evening would allow you to add all add like even more to it or do you not want to add more to it, I guess is another question.
Definitely don't necessarily want to add more to it. It's not it's never a problem of like needing more things for the list. We don't need more things to do. I know it's shocking. It's shocking.
But also if I did it at night, I would then be concentrating on what needs to be done, not taking the evening for what I want to do.
 So by doing it in the morning, it kind of starts my brain working towards work as opposed to like, okay, let me just get things out of my brain because if there's things on the list that I need to add things throughout the day or like, oh, tomorrow, I need to do this or whatever, I add it to the list right then because otherwise I'll forget like what I don't need to wait for the morning to add it to the list to do because that's what's on my schedule.
If I think of something that needs to be done, but I can't or don't want to do it today, then I just add it to the list and then it's done because it'll get picked up in tomorrow morning's transfer from my brain to my to do list. That's that's wild.
I definitely I love how brains are so different because I can't form sentences in the morning, which is why we usually record in the afternoon.
Which usually just means that like my morning is like, where did I leave off on something at the end of the night when my coworker in Australia is like, J stop working. Yeah, let me just pick that back up. Yeah. But that's awesome.
And then I do love the continued inertia of to do us like, you know, spoiler, I look at to do us every once in a while and I go, I should play with to do us. And even even in this process of looking at like my own system, one of the things I was looking at was like, could I digitize my own system.
So I did the worst thing that any person that has like a starts too many projects problem should like ever do. I messaged Brett Terpstra, who is just notorious for I needed to do a thing. So I built the thing. Right.
Safe to say I did build some stuff, but to do us didn't make the cut just because, you know, again, it's it's a inertia thing like I think the same reason that you pick to do is the same reason I keep looking at to do us as an option because I've I lived in it for so long for three or four years.
Right. And I've lived in my paper system equally as long. So there's like this fight of resuming the inertia that to do is to add versus the continuing inertia of the current thing. Right.
And that's that's something that's really interesting to try and like look at and and understand, okay, why is my brain trying to tell me to do X Y or Z. Like what is this what what is going on. And I'd I'd love to hear kind of where.
What like push you to make this change and where you're at and what you do. But I have one more question for you. Okay, fine. Okay, the this was originally called the unicorn method. Is it still the unicorn method or has it earned a new name? Oh, yeah, it's always the unicorn method.
Whatever I do is the unicorn method because I am the unicorn. So, okay. I am the unicorn. I speak for the method. Yes, exactly. Okay, okay. Okay, so fine. I will I will do my stuff then. Yeah. So obviously the last couple of weeks, there's been a lot of chatter around this.
The desk pad system, desk pad planning. I don't know we're calling this. I'm not calling it the desk pad system. It won't be called the silksonic method anymore. We're going to rename it to a different song that I I really enjoy. I haven't figured out what that song is yet.
No pressure because it'll it'll come to you when the name is cracked. Exactly. It will come to you. It'll it'll happen as it as it happens. But basically I use a suite of tools that are all integrated together called the plotter system.
I will add a link to the actual like foundational piece of this system. But ultimately it's just a three-ring binder system. If you know these things, they tend to get kind of pricey. I'm a few hundred dollars in at this point. I'm not happy about that.
But the alternative is buying more technology pieces that I won't ever use. So anyway, the the key piece of this is an eighteen dollar desk pad. And it's actually it's just the sheet of a four paper, a four being one of the larger pieces of paper.
And then as you increase that number, fold that paper in half. And then you keep folding them in half and half and half and half until you have the dimensions. CGP graded a video on on the A system of stuff. Go find that. Maybe there will be a link in the show notes. I don't know.
But anyway, this A four piece of paper and the only reason I talk about it like that is because the fact that if you fold it in half, it's... Or sorry, yeah. If you fold it in half, it's a A five piece of paper.
That's perfect because the other pages and the other pieces of this system are all A five pieces of paper. So I think you know what I do at this point. I write on this big piece of paper for the entire week. And then when I'm done, I fold it and I put it in my notebook.
And because my notebook is actually a three-ring binder, it's already in my notebook. So I just have to fold it into its A four size and then turn the page. And then now I have a fresh new big piece of paper.
So on that paper, I have four boxes and think of it as if you split the paper in half horizontally. You have like two long sections. And then if you cut that top section into equal thirds. In the top, and this is all subject to change. In the top right now, I have projects, tasks, and events.
These aren't concrete. These are just where I do, quote unquote, my dump of things that I know I have to do. Here are all the active projects that I have. Here are all the loose tasks that need to get done that aren't really associated with any of those projects.
And then ultimately, here are some events that I need to have on my radar. And then the bottom half is just notes. These are loose notes. These are notes like, hey, so this book just came out and it's available for pre-order. This little piggy is the darkest nursery rhyme.
Thank you, Brett Terbstra for breaking my brain with that for a day. And then also that like, hey, my daughter is going to be spending time with some of her friends this weekend. So like, these are things that are like, I don't really have much action that needs to happen from those things.
It's just I need to know, or I will go back and look for these things later. And having them all in one place is really nice. And then on the back side of that piece of paper is where I put all of my notes for those events that I have, those meetings that I have.
That way the entire week is encapsulated mostly on a piece of paper. And if I run out of paper, I do have loose A4 pieces that I just slide right next to it. So everything every week is kind of self contained. And that's kind of my system. So many questions.
So you use just one sheet of paper for the entire week. I do everything as much as possible on that one sheet of paper until that paper is full. Okay. And does it live folded or does it live spread out? So the plotter A4 paper, it doesn't fold in half.
Like you just fold it up like you would close a book. It kind of folds in like a semi accordion thing. So like you fold two thirds into the one third and then you fold one third of that last two thirds. They've got markers on it and makes it much easier if you go to the website.
It like makes more sense. So like it lives folded up. But unfolding is literally like you just pull on one side. And then now you can see the entire page. And then when you're done, you just kind of it just folds right back in. Okay. Yeah. Gotcha.
Because I'm looking, I'm looking at the website and it looks. I think I'm confused. I don't see the pull out pages. That you're talking about. And so I don't know if I'm looking at the wrong spot or. So all of their notebooks, they all have like, they're all like six hole punched or whatever. Yeah.
But they're also like attached to like a book. But you can easily tear those pages out like they, they come like right out. Yeah. So then basically you just take them off of whatever your book is and you put them in your actual plotter notebook. Gotcha. Okay. I see, I see the fold out one. No.
Okay. So it's like a file of facts, but with a different type of paper. Yeah. Okay. I think I get it. Thanks to this very boring. Section where Kathy tries to figure out paper. Yeah. It was one of those things where I think last, actually, I know it was last year.
It was last November because again, I have all of paper from what I started doing this. When I first, I bought like way too much stuff at one time.
Just to like try different things like I have like grid paper and they call it like there to do paper where you have like a section on the side for like, oh, how far along are you on this? And honestly, I don't use anymore.
And then I have like loosely like dot grid paper and then these big pages that I have. And honestly, the thing that I was using, I was using like the regular dog grid paper the most, but I wasn't liking how again, I didn't have that continuous view of what was happening through the week.
I would have to like start like flipping pages and figuring stuff out. Right. So I like having everything for the week on one page. It means I have to do less digging for other things. But in the end, I wound up just leaning on the things that I was using most, which was the big piece of paper.
And then like using that dog grid paper is just like, okay, hey, big piece of paper is now full. But all of the key things are on that front page and that rarely ever gets full. Like I don't, I don't put absolutely everything in there. I usually like put things that I know I need to do.
And it's usually just a brief explanation. It's enough context for me to know like what needs to happen next. Gotcha. Gotcha. Yeah, that's what it is. That was going to be my other thing is like, it doesn't seem like there's a lot like there's no extensive planning involved, which obviously like.
That's. You don't need specifics in that if it's something that can tweak your brain, right? Like this is just using. Like you have notes on the other side, obviously, like for your meetings and whatnot.
Do you ever like go through those notes to add them to the next day's stuff or like, do you transition or do you start fresh each new week? Like, how does that process work?
I've sent you a couple of pictures that will just kind of show like where I met midweek since we're recording this in the middle of the week.
I've been toying around with this idea of a backlog. What I've kind of chosen to do instead of having a backlog is I'm a pen person. I have multiple pins. Those pins have multiple colors. I need to get one more pin because I have one color that I think is going to become the backlog color.
And so basically when I go into things that are unfinished, I use kind of a bullet journalistic system of like, you make a dot for a thing. If you finish the thing, you cross out the dot. And if the thing needs to be migrated, you do a little like carrot, you know, saying, hey, that thing moved.
And then I just add it to the next week from there. And like I said, I think I'm going to start doing those in a different color. I just haven't found a pen that I want to spend, pen money on. To figure out what that color is. So right now I'm just using red for those.
But that's supposed to be things that are super important and sometimes things that are backlogged aren't necessarily super important. That's why they're backlogged. Right. So I'm still trying to figure out that piece. Okay. No, that makes sense.
Yeah, I think this, this is great, especially because it has it all in that space. Like you can see what you need to do. You have it available to write things instead of having it. Oh, I'll remember to do this later type of a thing, which I think is the most important piece.
Like I understand that very much because if it doesn't get run down, it will disappear. And I have a feeling a lot of our audience feels the same way. Yeah, the overall goal of this was to have a single place where I could see all the stuff without feeling overwhelmed.
And that's, I feel like this is kind of been that having to be able to see everything but having it all like quadrented off into its own sections means that at no point in time, am I looking at the entire page like, well, that's a whole lot of stuff.
Similar to how like to do is does like tagging and filtering and things. I've just never been able to put those practices to like effective use. So anytime I use any digital system, it's like, here's a laundry list of stuff for you to do.
Have fun with that and know that is in an invitation for people to tell me about why their system works because they use confilter tag label. Thank you. Like, no, this, this is working. So I like this. I'm going to do this.
Yeah, but but I will, I will say I don't remember if I showed you the picture of like, I am trying to replicate this for digital gardening.
I will say like not necessarily notes, but like links to things for the week and interesting articles that I could bring to my team for work that, you know, we can create content on and stuff like that.
This has been super helpful, but of course, as a paper system, it has all the same paper problems that they always have. So at least having my personal productivity feeling like it's a little bit more under control.
I'm now looking at can I replicate this digitally for not productivity, but for items for for things that are in my space so that I don't have to be constantly hunting things down. I love that.
Yeah, that's the biggest thing that I've started like with this idea of today's projects, I don't need to keep track of so I don't need like a dated planner to keep track of the tasks.
I'm just going to have this idea of what needs to be done just needs to be done today, like that's all I want to concentrate on. But occasionally there are things that I want to work on the future and trying to figure out how to do that input.
And I'm working on like Siri adding things I thought about adding reminders, like utilizing reminders for my stuff.
I it doesn't work in my brain for that like for me reminders is very much like location based or like repeat tasks that are long term so not like do is for my daily reminders that you know I need to eat and that sort of stuff.
And I have a reminder as I have reminders remind me you know every three months to give the pets their fully medicine that sort of long term reminder thing. And again, like it's so brains are weird.
And this journey of understanding kind of how someone how your own brain works can better adjust and tweak your systems to let it work easily because you shouldn't have to fight with your system to get it to work.
And I think that's important to remember that your system should work for you you don't need to work around your system like I'm not saying you like it needs to be able to help guide you and help support you.
So you need to have a little bit of like pressure from your system so you're because nobody can really be glad to do anything ever.
Even retired people you know have to take up the trash that sort of situation that so so having your system work for you and work with you is important to remember I think. Too often a lot of like these toxic productivity places will be like alright it needs to be really rigid.
You need to if you're not waking up at 4 a.m. then you're you've already failed and you need to stay on target.
You do everything on the list regardless of how you feel regardless of your day regardless of your energy level just keep doing it be consistent you know fight against that and I think that's really not helpful.
Just like why diets don't work if you're restricting what you're able to do you're going to push against it and it's going to be harder to stay in a state of productive happy life if you're if you're constantly fighting what you have to do.
But the biggest challenge that I have with you know you talked about reminders like reminders has been really great with you know hey here's this thing that needs to come up you know pay your car registration once a year like.
Yeah, those are great things to get little reminders on that are like, I don't wanna even index for this. Like I just need a little bump that's like, hey, registration's coming up, like that's great.
And again, I think that there's a difference between actionable, and I mean, I know that's actionable, but like actionable tasks versus like a little nudge. And I feel like the place where a lot of systems fail are they often want you to have everything in them. Yeah.
And I have clearly just stopped doing that. It's like, no, I put these types of things over here, and I put these types of things over here. And that's to say, like the source of truth in our house is still the giant wall calendar behind me. Like that is the thing.
We've been planning, you know, I'm gonna be visiting family for a month. And I have like phone calls with relatives that are just like, all right, hey, you wanna do this thing? Let me hold on, let me go to my office so I can look at our giant calendar.
And like all of that is being managed from there because anybody can just walk up, go to the giant wall calendar in the house and see what's happening. And maybe what I'll do is I'll like take a picture of that wall calendar and take it with me when I go on my trip.
That way I can continue to use it in the future. But and honestly, that has been the biggest challenge of this system so far is I know the, and the thing that I was, there was causing some panic was I travel a lot. And I don't know how well this system works on the go.
And I won't know until I'm on the go again. I think because I'm gonna be gone for such a long time, I'm probably gonna just take my system with me and just see if it works.
But I think for smaller trips, the nice thing about all of these systems being their own little like pad is I could just take the pad with me. Yeah. So maybe when I'm, you know, while I'm at a conference or something, I just have the pattern.
I know that they make like smaller versions of these systems as well. Like they have like eight, six, and they call like Bible and mini size things. And I think that that's, that might be the solution is say, hey, I have my little travel, the travel system. And then I have my, at my office system.
And then when I'm done, the travel system, I literally just included into the office system because everything is designed to work together. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's really beneficial and super helpful to be able to make those adjustments when you travel.
But keep that space where you have what you need and you can still feel like your system is working, even if you're in a different location, which I really, I like that awareness of it. And I think that's important to remember too. Situations are different.
You know, your adjustments are going to be different. What's happening is going to be different. And I think that's really special that you like are able to bring that awareness into it. And like mindfulness for it before it becomes an issue. And I still haven't come up with a name for it yet.
I was, I was, I was hoping Frank Ocean would save me on this, but unfortunately, no. You could call it the Frank Ocean method. That's always good. I've really been listening to a lot of like older Frank Ocean stuff and a lot of odd future stuff in general.
But we'll, I'll find some, I'll find something soon. Maybe that'll be my connection. I was just going to say maybe that's your connection for the next Fortnite is to come up with a name. Yeah. Close.
My, my connection for the next Fortnite is to look at some of the stuff that I've really been getting into lately. There's been like this whole like area of music that I've just fallen in love with recently coming like not out of, well, I guess out of our future.
So groups like the internet and the individuals that came from that band itself, like Sid and Steve Lacey and Matt Martians and all of them. And like, I've just been diving deeper and deeper into their discography.
And I put out a tweet the other day about how like I listen to Regina Specter's like tiny desk and how it literally just sounded like my brain set to music. Which is so wonderful, which it might be called, it might be called the Specter method. I don't know.
I'm not going to, I'm not going to make that canon right now. But I want to examine the music that I'm taking in because music is a very fundamental part of my life. I grew up around music, all kinds of music.
I have people in my family that are musicians still to this day like career musicians, studio musicians, things like that. So I just like the psiloxonic method came out of what I was listening to at the time. I think that this system will do the same.
I love that, especially because of the way that you name your stuff. It lets it kind of has a statement in your day like where you are in your life. I love that. So your connection is to come up with a name. Okay. Whatever that means to do. Perfect. I love it. Okay.
So mine is going to be a little bit different. So next weekend, I'm going on my surprise trip. I used the pack up and go service.
And so I should be getting a letter here in the next couple days to start planning my trip in that like it will send me the weather and like suggestions on type of things to pack.
And I will be using that time, not just to relax, but to do to concentrate on the unicorn business a little bit more than it has been. Over the past year, I've added. So I now have three mini unicorns that work with me and work for my clients and. Yes. And I really want to sit.
I spend so much time creating systems for other clients that I've kind of forgotten to do them for myself. And so I need to I'm planning on spending this time to really solidify my business as a whole because it's a business and not just me.
And so my connection will be to solidify business systems on vacation. So it's not a vacation. It's work. It's a workcation. It's like, you know, my gray method, like week to run away to the Alps, but not I'm not in Europe. So I can't, you know, go to a different country.
But it's it's going to be like a workcation very much like it's a business trip for just me. I get that. You're, I mean, you're working from a different space because you need to.
What was that? I think there was a computer company that that wants to use this slogan like think differently or something. Oh, interesting. Yeah. I think I've heard something about that. I wonder if I should I should look that up. I should. Yeah. I really like this.
I like the idea of of saying I am I'm getting out of my existing space to go focus on space that like a thing that is my existing space.
I'm needing to step outside of it to think about it in a way that's I don't want to say productive, but in a way that allows you to again think differently about stuff. Yeah, especially because because I'm framing it as a vacation in like like I'm I'm not reachable by clients. I'm not reachable.
I mean, my family can contact me and you know what not, but like I'm not going to be worrying about them because you know they're they're travel is is taking care of there's people to support to get my kid to dance and and that sort of stuff.
I'm I'm not I'm not here to think about anyone else, but me and my business in a way that I can't do when I'm working with my clients. And and so and in between that because I'm going by myself, which I'm very excited about and because I have some things that are planned.
I think that the company has like I have a will have a reservation made for the first night for dinner and potentially events or maybe not or ideas or or something like there will be plenty of relaxing done because obviously I can't like work on this 24 hours. Because it's just me.
I don't have to like I can think on something while I'm sitting in the hammock or I can you know go for a walk on the beach or in the matter whatever's going on just with myself and let things kind of.
mull over in my brain before I am like okay let's sit down and we're going to work on this like being able to just kind of go with the flow for a weekend just with me I think will be really beneficial and I think this is something that i'm going to do.
At least once a year hopefully twice a year maybe might do a unicorn retreat this way i'm not sure we'll see we'll see how it goes and so this next episode i will let you all know you know how this happens like how it worked that is awesome you know what else is awesome.
 Okay i'm not going to guess just tell me our conductors and their upcoming connections let's start with Deborah our soprano of the show whose new connection is to try to make some preliminary travel plans for their cousins for travel plans for her cousins wedding in September but you can't finalize anything because you have to wait for her brother to figure out his availability which you won't know for another couple of weeks oh my goodness I like this.
Like this whole vibe I feel deep in my soul anytime I plan something with my brother it's that same way like little things like okay i'm ready to plan but he's not ready so I wish you the best of luck and I hope you can do at least the baseline of planning without knowing what you can.
 Our next connection is from sky our blue dragon of the show who says I remember some of my first connections were getting ready for first semester semester and it's that time again yes in the next fortnight i'm moving in and starting classes i wonder if it would be beneficial sky for you to go and listen to those first episodes again not to pad our numbers at all but maybe to get some of that same.
 I'm inspiration that got you through the first semester absolutely alright Scott our guitarist of the show his connection is to move this weekend and unpack make a decision on the new job possibility once he's heard back from the company I hope that you get everything that you want and you come out ahead in this deals got you can do it and then robber are the nameless of the show as his next connection start crossing names off the list the guest list that is because.

 Full evidence matrix for personal decision and i'm here for it like whatever you need to do you can do it but i'm also really excited to hear about it so let us know in the discord so is up next the Oracle of the show they say my coach is making me do networking which is the worst i've rebranded it into my head is research okay but I still have to talk to people i'm going to email four connections and try to meet up with at least.
 One by the end of the month i love how you're rebranding things that are a little scary to things that are not so scary and things that you enjoy doing and maybe putting a spin on it and even then understanding like a rebrand has to also come with like okay but baby steps let's let's set the goal to be this not this over our children.
So i'm just going to be watching bigger number yes yeah. All right our hello of the show jumbo in wedding watch part two. His next connection is the seating plan is the biggest thing we need to sort out we need sorted only three and a half weeks left so jambos getting closer.

And if you would like to submit a connection you can always do so on Twitter by tweeting at conduit FM using the hashtag my conduit or hang out in the relay discord you can use question mark my conduit anywhere.
In the discord or you can always head on over to chant the channel show follow up and starting your message with the conduit icon you can throw in your connections there or any other questions comments concerns about us or the show going on.
Thank you so much for listening hey j did we can do it yeah i think we can watch the outside we can did it yeah we watch this condit it no i'll be watching our we can did our system check i will see you next quarter there we go.
Oh wait no we'll see you in one conduit okay there we go yeah we'll see you in a conduit. Have your headphones on. I'm sorry.
