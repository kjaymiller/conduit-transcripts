From Relay F.O. you're listening to Conduit, the show we Condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that has bones, has knuckles, and likes playing knuckle bones from time to time. This episode is brought to you by E.Camm and Computex.
I'm Jay and with me is, nope, nope, can't use that one, is the knuckliest knucklebone player of them all. The one that Kathy Campbell, who has never actually ever played knucklebones. Nope, it's true. It's true. Hi, Jay. Hi, Kathy, you've been traveling. Jay, you've been traveling too.
We both been traveling and we're both tired. We have. We have. I only, well, okay, so I've been in three different states for three different conferences in a two week period. You traveled all the way to a different continent. Yes, I went to Spain. Yes. I was excited.
I told my friends I would come back and be that person. I was like, you know in Spain, they. You know in Memphis. I know a lot of what they do in Memphis and some of it we don't talk about. No, it's true. Including the fact that I learned that there are no car testing rules.
So you can get a lift with cracked windshields and parts falling off the car. So that's that's that's fun. Tennessee, baby, that's how they roll. We'll talk more about our adventures in Spain and Memphis and Atlanta and other places in the after show.
But what happened this week in the discord? Oh, yeah. So this week because we were in Memphis, there was a surprise little meetup with a couple of hosts and we were able to slip a group picture into the discord and cause the correct amount of chaos. We also visited the pod cabin and St.
Jude and getting to do some planning in person, y'all are not ready for podcast. The thon and September, you are not ready. I'm so excited. My only hope is that I can be in Memphis to relish in the awesomeness that is podcast the thon this year. I did tell Steven this.
Steven was like, that sounds fun. And then that was the last I heard of it. So I'm just thrown out there. I'm still interested. And if if a country, if country beard, here's this, still interested. You'll probably have to message him directly.
What happened to you? I'm just going to go in London and be like, Steven, Steven. Yeah. Totally. I was going to ask you to tell us what happened last week in co-working, but you weren't there. I wasn't there. I was in Spain, as mentioned, and I proved it by sending a photo. It's true.
Apparently there were naps and emails. Yes. I nicely was bullied off of the co-working stream to go take a nap. That's nice. Shout out to the people who are nice enough to bully Kathy. It's true. Yeah. Very true.
I also shout out to the fact that when Jay is not at a co-working stream, things get done. It's almost like you distract us. I mean, I do play a very good distraction. And sometimes that's needed to get the most out of your productivity.
You just need something to take your mind off of things for a little bit. But yeah, if this discord business going to Memphis, visiting pod cabins, doing co-working, if any of that sounds like fun, yeah, become a super conductor today. You get this show with no ads.
You also get access to the pre-impost show where we kind of set things up for the show. And then in the post show, sometimes we play games. I think today we're just trying to figure out what all happened in the last two weeks while we've been traveling so much. And we both have stories.
I stuck out of a corporate retreat. And Kathy survived Memphis, which is an adventure all in its own. And so, indeed, especially this escaping of it because that was a journey. So if you're interested, visit I'm a super conductor.com and become a member today.
That's letter I, letter M, letter A, super conductor.com and become a mentor today. Kathy, member. A member. A member. A member. Shout-outs. Kathy, you have a shout-out? I have a shout-out for you. Because you bullied me into finding time to take a break, which was great.
And we had an amazing lunch. And also, you are so much taller than I expected, which when you come out of a very small car, it's even more scary. So, yes, I drive a rather small vehicle. It's not a, it's not a Mazda Miata. It's a Mazda 3. And it is a smaller vehicle.
So what I step out there is like this little vehicle, six foot something, human being stepping out of the vehicle. It may, maybe, yeah, we are talking about getting a new vehicle at some point in the future. And maybe, maybe a larger vehicle is in the works, I guess.
Just to remove some of the comedy out of it. But thank you so much. We had amazing occasion food. It was really, really good. Even the leftovers were really, really good. Oh, Jumbo Laya, that's what I had. Oh, yeah, that's right. And it was fantastic. You also got to meet Brittany.
And my Brittany, as we have titled her. And it's so weird that there was this moment where Brittany and I have this thing where apparently I get to go and try like new restaurants and stuff and then I always go back. And she's like, I want to experience new things with you.
And we were in the car and I was like, Hey, you got to meet Kathy at the exact same time that I got to meet Kathy in real life. So congratulations. That's awesome. I love it. Yeah. Technically, you met her before I did because it's true. You were closer. She got out of the car first. Yep. So yes.
And thank you for finding time in your very, very busy schedule to sneak out and have lunch with me because, man, that day was stressful. I think for everyone I left. Oh, yeah.
I got out of a meeting, jumped in the car, sped on the freeway, got to have lunch and then sped back home to jump into another meeting almost immediately after. So yeah. I'm glad it worked out when it did because definitely after that, not. And it would not have been possible.
My, the rest of that week was so busy that it was just bananas, how busy it ended up being. In fact, it was so busy. We might have forgotten to do some of these things we call connection checks. What? Who would do such a thing? Uh, yes. So my connection check was to stretch for a week.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, sorry. I'm sorry. It didn't zap because you. Sorry. Sorry. Forgive me. Connection check. Zap. Okay. Okay. Okay. So I did not stretch four times a week. I did not even stretch once.
I did use my TheraGun a couple times specifically on my calves because I did a lot of walking, but it was not enough. And I really should have stretched more. Were you tired, like soreness, all those things? More. I feel the ramifications of your lack of stretching. Yeah.
I definitely, I know I would have felt better if I had stretched. And I'm sad that I did not. That's fair. Yeah. That's always the tough part of like, especially like right now. At least out here, the allergies are in full swing, which are caused. It's causing sneezing and all these other things.
And I'm pretty sure it's been mentioned before on this show or in a pre show or something. But I get to this point where like I sneeze so hard that it hurts my entire body. Oh, that's not good. Yeah. And it gives like the prickliness. I don't know.
I don't know the best way to like describe it other than like a prickliness across my back like when I sneeze. Oh, yeah. I'm pretty sure that's called nerve damage, but yeah, that doesn't sound great. I'm not a doctor, but that does not sound fantastic.
Well, you know, when I went to the doctor, they were like, hey, idea, don't do that. And I was like, you know, okay, I won't sneeze. Sounds great. Totally fine. Yeah. So, yeah.
Yeah, I learned that like stretching and doing extra stretching in that time is like the only thing that slightly helps with it and by slightly, I mean ever so slightly. But a little bit is better than nothing. Yep. Right. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yeah. Yeah.
And then you call again and you provide copious amounts of feedback. Eventually, things happen. Now, luckily for me, they basically said, hey, your agent is in mandatory training and won't be available until the 26th. And I was like, okay, cool. I will reply back on the 26th and by the 27th.
we had finally progress. And now I have a meeting tomorrow with the contractor to get the process started and do all the things and insurance is paid out all the stuff that they're gonna do. So we are good to go. That's amazing. Yeah, I'm excited.
Like hopefully by the end of May, we'll have brand new floors and our refrigerator seems to be not flooding the place anymore as well. So like, you know, knock on all the things because goodness, it's been like eight months of dealing with this in some way, shape or form.
And I'm just glad that our long, our long standing nightmare is reaching its end. Huzzah. What about our conductors? Yeah, our conductors did great. Carly, our artist of the show says, Green Circle, I'm giving myself a pass because I reached out to two people.
They were both busy, which is understandable. So I haven't gone to coffee with anyone yet, but I reached out so I'm giving myself the win. Absolutely, absolutely. Yes. 100% our identical twin of the show Aaron said, connection check, green heart, train tickets and bus tickets are booked.
I still have two more to do, but some of the sites wouldn't let me for early August yet. All right. Our checklist enthusiast of the show Mike says, previous connection, green check mark, continue cleaning up task system and prepare for wedding anniversary and my daughter's fourth birthday.
System isn't perfect yet, but I have made significant progress and have the momentum to get the cleanup finished as a background activity celebrated sixth anniversary getting stuff done around the house and preparing for my daughter's birthday party. That sounds pretty great. Good job. Sounds fun.
Our pathologist of the show Laura says, green heart, my connection was to track a few activities at work other than some brief frustration over lack of service, sometimes leading to a delay in the timer starting. Yeah. I did pretty consistent.
I did pretty consistently track the few activities I'm interested in. The time of their timer didn't work well unless issues with disconnecting and walking away. So I'm doing timer in toggle. I want to keep this up.
So I do have a new connection this week, but plan on checking in on this as well again next week. Laura, yeah, the time you learn a thing, it sounds like you ran to some of the same problems that I did. And yeah, just gonna leave it at that. Just gonna leave it at that. Yeah. Yeah.
Our soprano of the show Debo says, connection check, green heart. I contacted the landscapers and them in the process of getting spring cleanup scheduled. Awesome.
And our tech podcast listener of the show, Pillix says, green circle, I've met up with my granddad and I have a total of three hours of voice memo of our conversation about sign making and all of that. Applied for jobs and kept learning about SwiftUI. Awesome.
And now you say sign making are like baseball signs like, you know, how it's still second or like making those signs that are all the rage on TikTok and like YouTube shorts. I'm kind of okay with either. And I think both would be really cool. I just kind of want to know. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely.
Let us know. Well, Pillix answered in the chat and said, what science which are, that's even cooler. That is really cool. Nice. Yes, please share pictures in the hashtag creativity. That'd be awesome. All right, our shark of the show, one pair of shoes, Chris says connection check.
My connection was to get ready for my in-laws to visit. Check. We are ready for their arrival. Nice. And our Canadian trivia card enthusiasts of the show, Erica. Erica, welcome back. Says question mark. I've been scared lately because of health and grief.
So I don't even remember what my last connection was. And that's OK. It is 1,000% OK. And I hope that health and grief concerns have been addressed. And as always, we are here for you as much as you need us to be. Indeed. A robotics engineer of the show, Aiden says connection check, green circle.
Many job applications were sent out. However, the job search continues in earnest. Hey, you are doing the work. Put in the work. Love it. And our mountain dweller of the show, lalalalalogang says, greenheart, parental leave has been the best month of my life.
I love having time at home with my wife and both daughters. Yeah, I remember this moment, I remember this moment where there was, it was like super, super chill. And then all of a sudden, I got the itch to go back to work. I personally have a problem. Yeah. It works out though.
Our mountain dweller of the show, lalogang. No, that was me. You just did that. Yep. Our fish bear of the show, Fish Kai says connection check, yellow circle. This conduit has been the opposite of less stress, but I did get back into a fun project.
Hey, you know what? I'm proud of you, given that yellow circle. And I hope this next conduit is a little bit easier for you. Something interesting about that. I love how putting a conduit as like a start and a stop to be like, hey, yeah, this last conduit kind of sucked. Next conduit, maybe better.
But like, being able to go, did the thing, the thing was done, and now we're at the end of it. But you know what, we're not at the end of? What are we not at the end of? My love for today's sponsor, this episode is brought to you by Ecam.
Ecam Live is a leading video production and live streaming studio built for the Mac. Ecam does all aspects of video, not just live streaming. It's perfect for simplifying your workflow.
It's easy enough to get started quickly, but powerful enough that you can create just about anything with video, and you can do it all with the Ecam app. I've been waxing poetic about Ecam ever since they first became a sponsor. And I have officially become a non-official Ecam advocate.
Hey, if you really want me to become an Ecam advocate, send me an email, you know, sadada, because I have now told other people about how they can use Ecam for their workflows. And this is for people who are doing live streams.
This is for people who run local meetups and just want an easy way to record things. This is for people who are just like taking business calls and want to be able to record it, but also have like a highly integrated like call system.
Like the nice thing about Ecam is that you have this virtual camera that allows you to share what you're sharing as your actual webcam.
So if you've ever had those instances where you're like, in a call, you've got a share screen, then you got to change screens and do the other thing, but you still want your face down at the bottom. And it's all a mess.
Like Ecam makes that so easy to do in that basically, the same way that you would be recording or streaming or doing whatever you would normally do with Ecam. That's just your camera because of that built in support.
So again, whether you're streaming recording, podcasting or presenting, everything is there for you in Ecam, including support for multiple cameras, screen sharing, a live camera switcher that lets you direct the show in real time. You can stand out from the crowd with high quality video.
You can add logos, titles, lower thirds, graphics, you can share your screen, drop in video clips, you can even bring on interview guests or use a green screen. You're that much of a professional. And Ecam does that and so much more. It does it all.
Their members are entrepreneurs, marketing professionals, podcasters, educators for some reason. I thought dancers, dancers may be too. Musicians, church leaders, bloggers, and content creators of all kinds. And you can get a month free today at ecam.com slash conduit, using the code conduit.
That's a whole month of ecam live at ecam.com slash conduit and use the code conduit. Go there now and check it out. Our thanks to ecam for their support of this show and relay FM. We also, so last night I recorded an episode of an incomparable game show and we streamed it onto YouTube.
And let me tell you, so Mr. Jason Snow hosted it, like not hosted it, but hosted the stream and used the ecam live zoom integration. And did some really, really cool things with the stream. I've included a link in the show notes.
And if you want to watch some people be really silly with a silly game, you can watch that. But more importantly, check out the fact that ecam was able to make it look this easy. And it was so easy, especially when you look into the fact that one of the players lost internet consistently.
And with the previous way that we used to do this, anytime a video dropped, it would mess up the feed and you'd have to like adjust and like manually make changes to it. And none of that happened in this. And it was pretty cool. Yeah, shout out to ecam.
Like ecam has like really just made my life so much easier and it sounds like it's making others as well. Indeed. So Kathy, are you familiar with knuckle bones? Well, I am now because you sent me like a little video thing.
And I think I remember like reading it in a book at some point or like somebody mentioning it. So now it kind of sounds familiar, but what would other people say? Or how about you explain to other people what the heck this is? So I found out about knuckle bones a few nights ago actually.
And it was, I just fixed my 3D printer. So I've been printing things again and it was funny because there's like this level of like when everything's working with your 3D printer, people tend to get bored because you printed all the things.
So now it's like, well, I printed everything that I needed. Now what do I do? And it's like you just keep printing more things, but you don't necessarily just want to like print Chachkis all day.
So one of the videos that I watched, which I will also add that link into the show notes was like things to do with your 3D printer once your board. And they basically said make fidget toys.
But then they also mentioned that you can make games and one of the games that they mentioned was knuckle bones. And knuckle bones, as I know of it comes from this video game called Cult of the Lamb. It's a relatively new game.
It came from Devolver Digital, which has made some really fun games in the past. And Cult of the Lamb had knuckle bones inside of it. So like knuckle bones was a game inside of a game.
And when you play the game, basically it's like a way to do high risk high reward moves to determine whether or not you can outscore your opponent in dice rolling. And ultimately you have nine dice that you roll, not all at once you roll them one at a time.
And then you can play dice of a certain number. And you just, you put them in their positions on the board one at a time. If you get duplicates, the number increases. But anytime someone else plays that same number across from you, then it wipes out your numbers.
So ultimately the way that you think about it is, it's my job to kind of try to have the highest score while also protecting myself from quickly being overtaken. So it's like a super, super reserved, followed by hyper, hyper aggressive, or maybe you get aggressive to try to get an early lead.
And so you're doing all these things and it's incredibly easy to play and hard to master. And this may be think of like other games that are very like high risk high reward.
But I wanted to ask you, Kathy, and are there things that you're doing in your life that you feel are extremely high risk but also extremely high reward? And just like with knuckle bones, there is kind of this casual to aggressive, or I guess conservative to aggressive strategy that you can play.
What is your strategy for managing some of that risk? Yeah, I don't think I call myself, okay, well maybe, okay. Yeah, that's the answer to you, like. I'm not sure how actually high risk my choices are. I don't consider myself like the type of person that will make a lot of like risky choices.
And yet I think back to the fact that I am self-employed and freelancing and those types of things. And I guess it could be considered fairly high risk in that it all could go away in a moment, which I guess is also the same for like any other job too.
But I like having at least a partial understanding that everything's gonna be okay. Like having at least like an 85% chance of success maybe. What about like if the risk is like, I was explaining the stock market to my sister, the whole stock market, all of it, in a nutshell in five minutes.
But basically my sister is picked up on the whole sports betting craze. And I was like, okay, you know how when you do a sports bet, you can do like $5. And if you win, you get like $20. But if you lose, then you just lose the $5.
To me playing the stock market in some ways is a much slower version of that except for, you put in thousands of dollars, but even when you lose, you don't necessarily lose all of your thousands of dollars unless you just aren't paying attention.
You might lose a few hundreds of your thousands of dollars. Or you might make a few hundreds or thousands of your thousands of dollars depending on how you play depending on your patience and all these other things.
But even with that, like with the high risk high reward, yes, you probably shouldn't put all of your money into the stock market or go to Vegas and put all your money on black because that's very high risk, very high reward.
But I do think that there are ways that you can do high risk in a way that is, the risk is distributed. Yeah, I think it, I, okay.
Do I understand the stock market? No, because do I think, well, okay, I understand it in the sense that I think it's dumb and that it's all, okay, I don't put anything into the stock market.
It's too risky for me, but also I'd have to pay too much attention to something that doesn't, that I don't care enough about, if that makes sense.
And so I don't do the stock market, but I can see how it could be seen as something that will like potentially pay off, but you have to like know when to actually send that out, like when to sell. So, so, so, so, bye, bye, bye, whatever.
That's the part that I don't get, like how, I don't understand how stock brokers like do it and that's their job, but yeah, I don't know. I think with that even, and again, I, I'm, I do have stock, most of my stock came after I worked at companies where they were like, we're gonna give you stock.
So then I was like forced to pay attention to it. The thing that I have learned is one, don't buy stocks and things that you're not interested in because yeah, you won't, like you just won't pay attention to it and then you're like, oh, that money.
What happened to it? Where did it go? Sometimes that's good. Christina Warren, relay FM switch on alum would say, you know, your money, just pretend that some of that money doesn't exist and like don't think about it, it doesn't exist. It's not real.
Like, especially that's good when they give you the money and you're like, oh, yeah, here's some money in the form of stocks. Just like, okay, just pretend that it's not real.
And then later on, you can go look and maybe you have more money or maybe you have less money, but ultimately you have money. Is the question, is the answer? I think for me as someone who has recently started buying shares, there is like this balance.
And again, this isn't a financial advice podcast. So everything I'm saying, this is what I do. This isn't necessarily what you should do.
But out of my paycheck, I take a little bit of money that allows me to buy one or two shares into a company that I am paying enough attention to that if something were to happen, I would know about it and be able to make decisions.
I don't have to go out and do too much research to be like, oh no, dump all the money. Cause like, at the end of the day, just me listening to the podcast that I listened to on a regular basis, I'm going to hear about something if something so devastating happens.
 And even with that, there are considered high risk stock and low risk stocks, like there are things like penny stocks, there are things that are like, you know, you have the big companies that are trillion dollar companies that could run for the next 10 years off of their savings at the same rate that they're currently operating at.
And you would never, they would never have to make another dime for that decade before anyone would notice. Like there's, there's a lot of things where like, yeah, you can put money in those, you're not going to get the big wins, but you're also, you're mitigating your risk.
And that was one of the things that I thought about with this, you know, moving this away from finance and bringing it into quote unquote productivity.
I, I think that, you know, one of the things that we're going to talk about in the after show is I stuck out of my corporate retreat to go visit, you know, a Spanish city that used to be a Roman colony.
And were there risks in sneaking out of the like, and I say sneaking out with a lot of like, it wasn't really sneaking out like people knew where we were. Yeah, I was like, you didn't leave in the middle of the night and nobody knew what was happening, but it was not where you were supposed to be.
Yeah, it was like, hey, everyone is expecting you to be at this thing. Instead of here over here eating really, really, really good food. But in doing that, we took, I took steps to mitigate the risk. I didn't go alone. I went with a group of people.
I went with a group of people, one who had been to Spain before, not that particular part of Spain, but at least knew how to navigate the landscape.
How do I call a cab if, you know, I can't catch a bus or where are the train stations? And how do I get to the train stations? How do I pay for my train ticket? Cause these are things in America that we just don't do. Right.
You know, and it was doing like, what is this food? Am I going to get sick for meeting this food? Luckily we were in Spain. We weren't in like an area where like you just, you know, you're going to get sick for drinking the water.
But there were a lot of individual pieces that as I was looking at the risk, as I was getting ready to roll the dice to play knuckle bones here, in the end, it was, let me do this and address all the risks up front.
Let me work to mitigate them and let me cheat a little bit to get the odds in my favor. And I think this is what, you know, Kathy, when you talk about running your own business, well, one, you don't run a business. You run, well, you run a business, but you also run several businesses.
And a lot of the effort that I've seen you putting in is like, how do you make it so that the risk is distributed across the businesses? So that if one is underperforming, you can lean on the others a little bit more. Yeah, I'm going to stop talking now.
Yeah, no, it's, and I think I think that's, that's a really good point.
It's why like I don't see myself ever not having multiple, you know, streams of income and like communities and like people in my life to use as support and friends and, and the like because you don't know what's going to happen.
And you don't want to put all of your eggs in one basket, regardless of what those eggs are in my mind.
I, so I don't, I don't have that in my brain of a high risk option is easy or, let me just, you know, stop everything and put all of my attention into this one company to help, you know, make it grow because would I be better? Like, would any of my stuff be better if I didn't have my other things?
Absolutely.
If all of my energy was being put into X or Y or Z instead of X, Y and Z, I could get some things done, but I don't want to because there's also the chance of it not working. And if it doesn't work, I have too many people responsible to me to be able to just be like, okay, bye, everything's fine.
I'll just, you know, go work at McDonald's. There, there is this level of like, there's the one like we just don't want to. Like you and I both, oh, the community that I talk about all the time is now officially one year old today, not today. Happy birthday. Yeah.
One year's old as of a few days ago. But the, there is this conversation of in that of like, Hey, if I focus full time on that, what would that look like? Well, step one, I would be broke because it doesn't make any money. And the money that it does make doesn't go to me. It goes to the community.
So like immediately like, okay, that's a high risk that I can't take. But when I look at my day job, when I am taking the work that I and some people in our relay of them switch on community have worked on and I say, Hey, I want to take a big swing.
I want to take a high risk swing here and create this content that is going to really make us stand out. As I'm thinking about it, it's like, okay, how do I do this in a way? That combines my passions.
One, I want to have accessible content, you know, for everyone to consume and do in a way that is great. So by inserting some risk, I insert more focus, which is great because some risk and focus can be connected. The higher the risk, the more you're paying attention to the things that are risky.
Even if it fails, there was progress. I think that we spend too much time focusing on the outcome and not enough time. I don't want to say like the journey was or was it the goal was the destination? Something like that. No, that, oh gosh, yeah, I don't know.
The desired outcome was the was the journey, not the destination. Yeah. To that effect. Sure. Basically us doing conduit as a podcast that yes, we are professional productivity experts because we do get paid to talk about our thoughts on productivity.
But that means that we are able to do it on our terms in our way. And there is a slight level of risk in that in that our sponsors could go, well, we don't like the way that you do it. But that's by the amazing beards that make relay of them. We're smart enough to think about that.
They were smart enough to think about the market and they said, hey, we're going to create contingencies.
But meanwhile, Kathy and I don't really spend a lot of time thinking about how many sponsors do we have? We don't think about, you know, the, you know, what's our CPM or what's our overall audience. Kathy yells at me every time I look at the numbers. Yep. Don't look at the numbers. Absolutely.
I avoid looking at the numbers unless I have to explain it to someone and they're asking me. And then I'm like, I don't know. Let me go check. Yeah. But we're able to not think about those things. We're not able, we're able to not think about the risk because the reward is the destination.
The reward is getting on these calls to every other week and talking to one another. The reward is getting on the calls in the opposite weeks and talking with all of our friends and kind of goofing off and having fun.
And you know, the sad thing is like, yeah, if, if conduit stopped happening, then a lot of those things would go away. But we don't have to stress about the risk because the reward isn't a lump sum all at the end. The reward is a continuous stream of dopamine rush. Yes. It's happening. Yeah.
Every time, every time I think of this show and the connectors and conductors and the connections that we've made, I just, my heart sings a little bit because I know that it's not, this show is really special.
The people, if you're listening to this, thank you for being the special person that you are because you are what makes this show this show. And the fact that you all come here and listen to us and support us and, you know, our still are still here is really, really special.
But also it, it helps make the show what it is. This is such a, it's such a unique setup in that it's not necessarily about us, which I think is a, it was pretty risky.
It was a, it was a risky choice to, to do, which is why we kind of like hedged our bets a little bit when we started and now we're just all in and I just love, I love that you all are here with us and listening and hanging out. And yeah. So thanks for that. Yeah.
The suits were definitely a little concerned about the risk of our show. Not, not to say that they didn't think that we could do it, but they were very much like, here are some things that you might want to consider. You should think about. Don't give Jay too much time on the mic. It's a danger.
That was not what they said. That's not what they said. But to wrap this up, we, we get that you are probably in a period of your life where there is some thing that you're looking at that might have a high risk, high reward scenario.
And just like with knuckle bones, yes, you should take risks because those risks will pay off. If I put down two sixes and that person is struggling to find that third six, eventually all of the other fields are going to get filled up, which means that I have a better advantage in the late game.
But that also means that I have to think about what they're doing as well. And I need to be prepared for that. I need to balance my risk with concerns, with some conservative plays. And at the end of the day, I need to spread that reward out as much as possible.
Waiting to make a big swing at something that's going to result in either a strikeout or a home run if we're talking in baseball terms, that's rough. There are very few people who will always either strike out or hit a home run.
But on the other side of that, if I say, hey, you know what, I'm going to do the risky thing because the reward is high, but the payoff is distributed over a longer period of time.
Then I get to reap the benefits and I get to see the warnings that my risk may not be paying off and be prepared to deal with it in the meantime. But also be careful. Yeah, all that's to say, be careful. We understand risk is scary. It's okay to take risks.
Have plans, have backup plans, have backup to your backup plans. But most importantly, we believe in you and that you can do it. Absolutely. Kathy tells us about our other sponsor. Yeah, this episode of Condo It is brought to you by Computex 2024. It's one of the world's largest AIOT.

So, Kathy, in our risk-filled world, what's you going to do for your next connection? I am going to take a risk by taking naps. You're kind of risk-sleeping through your alarm. Yes.
I'm going to do risky naps in that they are going to be short periods of time, where really a 20, 30-minute nap is perfect. That is what I need.
And I should have, it looks like I do have time and availability this week to do that probably less chance next week, but definitely definitely opportunities for napping. And if I put it in my connection, I will not feel guilty about taking naps.
So, thank you for the accountability here, because my body needs to recover from all of the travel and all of the awakeness. And yeah, I'm ready. I'm ready for naps.
What about you, Jay?
 Well, I'm going to double down on the risk that I did take with my job, and that is I am going to do my job and finish the workshop, but I'm going to do it using this repeatable pattern that I kind of developed at my last job and brought to this job, and have really hopes to get people on board with.
And this is kind of important because the first workshop that I did, I had to kind of create a hybrid version of it to kind of fit the existing structure of things. This time around, we've created the workshop from scratch, and I've been responsible for it from the beginning.
So, I've had the ability to come in and just do it the way that I wanted to from the start. But the best part of this is that we're going to be taking this and turning and creating a new workshop out of it after this. That's very, very similar, but there are some key differences.
And if everything is done the way that we expect, then what we should see is our ability to quickly turn around these workshops faster than anyone who's been doing these workshops previously has ever been able to do before. And that's that's kind of the key.
That was the like the missing piece was like, okay, hey, if we if we have a formula formulaic approach, we should be able to do these quickly. And yeah, my the workshop I'm giving is on Wednesday. So that gives me about a week to do this.
And then after that, I have to immediately start working on the next one, which we'll see. We'll see how that works. That's exciting. I love that. What about our conductors? Yeah, our artist of the show Carly says new connection. Keep trying to grab coffee with someone.
I need to reach out to more people. I like coffee. Our tentacle twin of the show, Aaron says 10k is on the 12th. So make sure I prepare and take care of myself to ensure I'm in good shape for it. Yes.
Our checklist enthusiast of the show Mike says new connection finished preparations for my daughter's fourth birthday party for such a good age. Yes. Oh man, I remember those I remember those times.
Our pathologist of the show, Laura says I like to recommit to do my reviews daily, weekly, monthly, et cetera. I did this very consistently for January and February and fell off a bit in March. It was a really good reality check. Oh sorry, it was a good reality check and way to get perspective.
Also, it was so nice being able to have a written overview of my months. And I sometimes feel like my days aren't connected to each other. Thanks to how my brain works or doesn't sometimes also keep tracking things. You can do it, Laura. Absolutely.
Our soprano of the show Debo says next connection, a friend died of cancer recently. And she requested that people submit memories for her of her for her children to read. So I need to write something up for them. That is so sweet. And I'm so sorry for your loss.
Our tech podcast and or yeah, listener of the show almost said tech podcast enthusiasts of the show. Pillik says so it's now time to overcomplicate a website that can and should have been made with just a bunch of HTML and CSS for my granddad's project that I still need a code name for.
Keep going with Swiss UI and recurring connection and keep applying for jobs. Pillik's I'm just going to throw it out there at sea Shopify. Do you need much more? And if you're not selling them. Squarespace. Even if you sell. Yeah. Yeah. I would never recommend anybody go on at sea anymore.
Oh, just because it's so deeply saturated that it becomes next to impossible to get any sort of like traction. Yeah. And then charges keep going up and it's way too expensive. So Squarespace indeed. Squarespace. Our Canadian trivia. Nope. Our shark of the show. One pair of shoes.
Chris says my connection for next time is to get the back patio power wash to get ready for warmer, drier, winter, weather, not winter, warmer, drier weather. Exciting. I'm excited for the for the warmer weather for sure. Yes.
The Canadian trivia card enthusiasts of the show, Erica says give myself another two weeks of grace before I aim for accountability. I like it slow and steady. Take the time that you need. A robotics engineer of the show, Aidan says next connection. Keep working on pumping out job applications.
Also look into doing some freelance work in the meantime. Feel like I should build up more of a portfolio and hopefully getting some money to do it seems like a win win. Yes. Yes, it does. That's a great idea. Our mountain dweller of the show. Low gang. Says next connection.
All the time off gave my mind a much needed rest. I realized the change I need to make in my life. I'm going to transition out of my desk job and become a personal trainer. What? This conduit I will figure out how to make a website get my certification and talk to my boss about going part time.
Whoa. Was not seeing that coming. We are definitely not the same person because transition out of my desk job. I was like, oh, that sounds fun. And you said, become a personal trainer. I was like, never mind. I'm so excited for you. That's incredible. Congratulations. And you can do it. Absolutely.
Our fish bear of the show. Fishy Kai says new connection. Sleep has once again slipped time to make it a priority again. Yes. Come and join me in the nap zone. But not actually that be weird. And our distracted Colombian of the show. Ramon. Says very distracted Colombian here.
I've been away from the gang for a very long time. I don't remember my last connection. So I'm declaring connection bankruptcy and starting fresh. Absolutely valid. Totally here for it. New connection.
Create a powerful reminder shortcut that will allow me to either manually type or use Siri to enter a reminder into my phone to help me remember every idea that pops into my super ADHD brain in an organized way. I started playing with the app. And I think it'll help me a lot.
I know there are a lot of better apps out there. But I want to start with reminders and see how it goes. I'm not great with shortcuts. So wish me luck. Ramon, this sounds fun. Keep having fun with it. One suggestion. Data jar. Data jar. Keep all those ideas and data jar.
That's just what I would do. But keep it simple drafts. Drafts. Also an option. But I think keeping it in reminders could be a good choice too. Especially nice and easy with all of the options available. So yeah, keep it simple. Don't try and overcomplicate it. Felix. Excuse me.
And it'll all be great. It wasn't me this time. Yeah. It was me calling you out. Now you can do it. And the best part of this Ramon is getting all the stuff done in the shortcut and then swapping out the end piece makes it very easy. So I you got this. You can do it. Yes, we saw the Y-Pilix.
It's fine. It's fine. Yes, it's fine. I'm just teasing.

I am so happy that this option is here and I can't wait to decide which one I'm going to order because there's so many good choices but I definitely will need something to take with me for July that says conduit on it.
But all of our three designs that you can get in stickers are also available in the drinkware. So check out youconware.com. That's y-o-u-c-o-n-w-e-a-r-i-t.com. I'm kind of filling the tire water bottle. I also think that the water bottles make really good sticker caddies.
So if you have a bunch of stickers and then you have one that's just baked onto the can. So like yeah. That's perfect. And then I'm fairly certain that means that they are dishwasher safe which means you won't have this gradually like stickers peeling off after you've washed it which is helpful.
Yep. So you con drink it. But first you have to go to uconware.com to go to our merch store and wear slash drink conduit on your body and inside of it apparently. Oh wow. That way weird. Yeah. I went in a direction that I wasn't fully prepared for. Clearly.
