Hey friends, Jay here. In the last week, we saw violence once again directed towards black folks this time in Buffalo, New York. This hits me in a few ways, one being a black male, two being a black male that has experienced racism and violence because of it in my life.
And three having a few friends in the Buffalo area, I can only say that my heart goes out to the families that were impacted, my heart goes out to the community as a whole. That being said, we, and by we, I mean, Kathy and I talked about it and came kind of the two conclusions.
One, we have to make a statement. We have a platform, we have to be responsible with that platform and we have to speak up against hatred, violence and the things that, the things that impact us disproportionately as underrepresented people. That said, this is that statement.
We don't want to amplify the hatred or the violence anymore than we have to. We don't want to, we want to give folks listening that may be impacted by this space where they can step away from it for an hour.
So that being said, we're not going to talk about it during the show, but we did want folks to know that our hearts go out. I want to get into the community, the people, the family members, all of those impacted by this act of hatred.
That said, we're going to be a little bit more excited, we're going to be a little bit more happy, but know that this isn't our hearts, this is something that we are thinking about. So with that being said, on with the show.
From Relay FM, you're listening to CondoEd, the show where we conduo our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to CondoEd, the show that doesn't have all the fancy toys, but we're still getting by with what we have.
I'm Kathy and I'm here with or well, and here with me, or I'm here with, I don't know, either way, we've got our big bad, finally, cobbled free boy Jay. Hi Jay. It's like the big bad wolf, but it keeps coughs and set of blows and sounds down. Okay, we are now copywriting this idea.
Please I need an illustrator. We need to finish writing this out. I think this could be a really good explanation. We have the pigs give the wolf a mask. Are you saying? Okay, so for those that don't know, as we recorded the last episode, I had actually contracted COVID.
Yeah, didn't know it myself had tested right before and it was negative. And then Kathy was all like, well, false negatives can happen. And then yeah, the next morning, I tested positive. Thanks, Kathy. It was Kathy's fault. No, it wasn't. Excuse me, it was not my fault. Thank you very much.
I'm going to solve the details as a whole. Yes, yes, all our options. Anyways, we're here for CondoEd and we're so excited that you are joining us.
And let's start with some shout outs to people in the community and our community that we love and adore and want to point out, Jay, do you have any shout outs today?
Yeah, I've got two friends and I'm shouting them out and they know who they are and they know why they're being shouted out and this is all.
Oh, okay. That's cool. I'm keeping it vague. Vague is great. I'm going to be the opposite of vague and say, hooray, our first CondoEx screen social happened even though it was just me and the fantastic editor, Javier.
We went to Salt and Straw on Sunday because Javier is in town for work, he work and it was super exciting to finally meet somebody who has been editing my voice for many years.
So many, many people know inside of our relay FM switch on discord that I love ice cream and when I give a talk, I celebrate with ice cream and when I meet with friends, we celebrate with ice cream and beers, but mostly ice cream.
I am so mad that we waited until the day Jay got COVID to do an ice cream social. I know. We will do more ice cream socials. There will be ice cream happening and I will be there. I will make sure that I am there this time. We will make sure that we schedule it when you are able to be here.
Yes, yes, yes. But also Javier, thank you so much for all that you do and I hope the ice cream was amazing. I have been told that you went to a really great place. Yes, it was so good and this month was like flower floral flavors and they were very good.
I had a pistachio rose, something something something along with my classic favorite pair and blue cheese and Javier had the Jasmine tea with milk and and also honey lavender.
I need to make sure that the next time you are in San Diego, we go to Anz dry cleaning which is my favorite ice cream place in San Diego. I have many questions. Yes, it is permanent press. Perfect. Questions answered. And it might be star tree, I am not sure.
Let's move on to a little hint of something coming. Yeah, a more specific shout out to one of our amazing relay FM members. It's got. Really FM switch on, I am sorry.
Scott, for hearing my request to have a custom intro music done and they may or may not have started on something that we indeed did request. So shout out to you, Scott or not.
If you haven't started on it, do I have to take the shout out away? No, but we'll cover it a little bit in the connection in the conduction, wow, in the conductor connection section that it's started but it's not done.
So we're not going to play it yet, but we're very excited for whatever you create for us. And that happens. No rush. We're going to get there.
Am I the only one that thought of conjunction junction when you said that? No, because I started to like say it and then I wanted to like sing it and I won't. So you're welcome. Conduct your connection. That's your section. Anyways.
So it is membership month in Relay FM and there's a fancy thing for, sorry, switch on and there's a fancy thing for us to read but I actually don't know where that is which makes me a bad relay community leader person. Steven don't hate me.
I could look for it but instead I'm going to make it up as I go along. Basically through the end of June, the relay host will be submitting a variety of really fun bonus specials coming down the pipe. I have heard there's a couple as of today.
There are a couple that are already out and there are so many more coming including a very special conduit episode. Now that we've scheduled it, do you think we can tell people what is coming or should we let them? Have I ever spilled the beans on anything on the show? No of course not.
Why would you have done anything like that? But I don't know. Are our conductors, do you think they deserve the awesomeness that we are going to say to say something? No, they deserve nothing. That is a lie.
So we don't have an official name of it yet because I'm going to tell our listeners what's coming just because we love you and I love you more than Jay does. Like I said, we don't have an official name but right now we're kind of thinking something a little bit like make, roba do it, roba do it.
Basically we don't have a great name but we have a three way cross over. We're going to have so much fun. The fantastic friends over at Make Do and Roboism will be hanging out with us on Monday to record something.
We'll see what it ends up being because it's going to be something very special and I'm very excited for you all to share. So to get that, if you are not already a member, which if you are not already a member, what the heck are you doing? But if you would like to become a member, go over to relay.
fm slash conduit and you can hang out, give us money which we greatly appreciate. The financial support that you can contribute to us.
But more than that, you have the ability to not only get the amazing members episodes that are coming out this year but also members episodes from the past which are fantastic and I highly recommend.
But you can also join the discord and hang out with some really fun people including all of our conductors that are hanging out in the discord right now because surprise we record live for some reason.
I am excited for this as it is the convergence of creativity, productivity, are we still productivity show? I kind of forgot. Sometimes. When we want to be and all of the isms that are associated with that.
So if you have an ism that helps you to be productive or creative, then yeah, I think that this bonus is going to be just for you. Yes, it's going to be something we're very excited.
And I can't wait for you to listen at some point in the future because I'm going to be nice and let Javier because of course I do the scheduling. So I get to put us in the schedule wherever we want.
So I'm going to give Javier all the time that's needed to edit the chaos that will come and it's going to be great. It's going to be great. But let's stop talking about the future and talk about the present or the past. I think we're going to talk about the past. Let's do our connection chat.
Oh, something's at me. How'd your connection go, Jay? Did I tell you I had COVID? Why? Why you had COVID? So for my connection, which was to create an automation for file maintenance, which I did get a reminder to also write something about that.
And then I got a fellow reminder of that my website is still broken. There was a lot happening. And at the end of the day, I did some things that were file maintenance processes. But I did not automate them. And my website is now working. But secretly it's broken again. Oh, no. It's fine.
I know why it's broken. I just need to figure out how to fix it without iCloud like overwriting everything that I did, which is, yeah, iCloud going to iCloud. Yeah, there's a lot happening there. But at the end of the day, I mean, I had COVID. So that's been my excuse for everything.
Why having you called your mother? I have COVID. Why are you ignoring everybody's calls? COVID. It's definitely been, I've been throwing that thing around. Not the COVID around. I haven't been throwing the COVID around. That's not good. But my excuse for everything so far is I've been sick.
I did nothing but self-care, which is equally as important. So yeah, I'm going to take a yellow circle on this one. I think that's great and totally valid and might even argue that you probably could take a green. But I'm okay that you didn't. That's okay, too.
How are you? I now currently have more than 500 gigabytes free on my two terabyte drive, which previously I had about 340. So that means that I have a big green checkmark because I got rid of more than 100 gigabytes files on my hard drive.
But the fun fact is that most of these, so I stopped using iCloud photos because it was freaking me out, not being able to easily access them in ways that I like to manage. Like I liked to better manage my phone storage. And so I turned off iCloud photos years ago.
And basically I did a very complex, difficult, not recommended way to get my photos off of iCloud photos into the Mac photos version. And at some point in there, I also discovered that I had a couple separate photos libraries.
And so at one point, I exported all of the photos from one of my, I, sorry, photos, libraries into the desktop so that I could import them into the new library so that everything would be all in one. I take a lot of photos and these aren't even the professional ones.
These are just like my work, like my phone photos. And I had a lot.
So what I did this morning, because I definitely planning ahead and in charge of, you know, my life and my connections and connections, I started getting rid of the photos that were on the desktop by putting them into photos and then deleting the extra.
So the duplicate photos are no longer on my computer. And so far, I've gotten rid of 150 gigabytes worth of photos. So that's great. So yeah, green checkmark for me.
I'm sure we'll talk about this in a little bit, but I did put in my purchase order for my new machine that I'm going to be using for work. And one of the things that I made sure of was like, I need all the space possible.
I will say Microsoft was not excited when they saw four terabytes on that request. I managed to get to. Hey, you know, you got to ask for high so that you get what you get and you don't throw a fit. Exactly. Exactly.
But that being said, I did let them know that there would be future requests for external hard drives of all sorts and sizes because they refuse to give me my extra two terabytes. But you also work a lot with video too for your right.
And there's also like, I mean, I tried to do a TikTok thing when I was in Salt Lake City and I panicked and I did like one video and did not publish it because I never got to doing the other part for the video.
So it's literally just me panning back and forth between two buildings, which made no sense. Oh, no. The credits give us next time. Next time. Next time. There will be next time. So. Yes. Yeah.
I'm just glad that you were able to get your storage stuff under control because mine just is still move all the things to another cloud storage that I pay very little money for and then delete everything off my computer until it fills up again about two months later. Right. Right. I, yeah.
I definitely don't understand at all what you're talking about. Oh, hey, look, it's time for our conductor connections. Papa bow. First up, we've got Debo, our soprano of the store. What? What the, what, why? What? What are words? Seriously, soprano of the show has a green check mark.
They kept, she kept her husband fed and hydrated after his surgery and made him stay in bed with his foot elevated. Certainly prevented him from trying to help change the battery on a smoke alarm because she didn't want him balancing on a ladder on one foot, even though he wanted to help.
Well, frickin' done. It's so hard to help people like not do what they need to, what they feel like they want to do, especially very stubborn, humans in life. I definitely don't know anything about that. So well done on making it so that he didn't hurt himself worse.
Next is our fancy music boy of the show, Ryan. And Long Term Connection Check, Green Checkmark, finally been able to get my brain bits properly looked at and things seem to be on the upswing in that department. That's awesome. Congratulations.
 I still need to get some brain bits looked at myself, but I'm glad that, again, Long Term Connections, I think that's a thing that we don't think about too much because of the format of the show, but I love that you've been able to put something down and say, I will manage this over a longer period of time because it's that important to me.
And now you can say, finally did it, finally on the upswing, this is great. Yeah. The idea behind the connections was initially to make sure that, to have these smaller ideas.
 So not a theme, not a yearly theme or quarterly theme or anything, just something that you can really concentrate and work on in a two week period of time, but it's 100% okay to have a longer term, especially if it's something that you tried in the shorter term and didn't fully finish or feel like you succeeded.
So I love this and I love this idea and I think it's super, super great. I'm super proud of you, Ryan. All right. Next up, Arca Tarris of the show, Scott, he has two connections.
Number one, fitness, green check mark, he finished the 5K training program that was working through and was able to get through the entire program with no injuries. Heck, yeah. No injuries is super great. Number two, learn logic.
He says an X, but I'm going to say like an orange circle maybe because he's working on it. He's learning. He's finished learning something like this, but he says he's not utilized any of the resources he found for learning logic, just didn't have the motivation this fortnight.
He did spend a little time working on J's request, but didn't make much progress on that either. So I think having a smaller connection of like specific points to work on, not just immediately learn logic. I love how as we're recording, Zoom keeps cutting your voice out half like so it fades out.
Did it change my preference? If it did, no, it's not automatically adjust. That's just me. Cool. I just broke it.
Similar to Scott's learning logic, one, one does not simply learn logic, but also I just found out that one of the tools that I use, isotope, actually came out with a major update like in December.
And because Kathy has refused to let me edit the show, I completely missed it, but also I've not been in a position to where I just have a random thousand dollars to just drop on software just because I think even my business planner is like, no, no, you don't get to play with this toy right now.
Yeah, especially because you don't need to. Exactly. And I will continue to not let you edit the show. But it takes the voices out of the music and it takes the music out of the voices. Anyways, I think it's time to give Sof's connection check. Okay.
Our Oracle of the show Sof says connection check, green apple, I finally cleaned out the closet this afternoon and I've been easing back into work but managing not to go over my part time hours. I love it.
I go to therapy on TikTok and one of the, one of the people that I follow a lot was very much like yes, part of self care is setting up boundaries even when that includes work, which is a thing that we tend to often neglect.
So by all means, congratulations for not only getting back into the swing of things, but also keeping it under control. Yes. And that being aware of kind of where you're at and what boundaries you need to put on yourself is really important. Our blue dragon of the show has a teal blue heart.
I'm stealing that for you, Sky. So you don't get yelled at by Jay. And they've gotten into the summer routine and also got a bad sunburn, which sunburns are bad. Where sunscreen your mom is telling you to wear sunscreen. But other than that, I'm glad you've gotten into the summer routine.
I hope you are able to continue doing everything that you wanted to do in the summertime so that you can enjoy it and relax and breathe, but also don't get any more sunburns. Yeah, because then you'll be a red dragon. Anyway, Chin Toss, our tire advocate of the show says, connection check, sick.
Yes, 100%. This is Chin Toss message to me. And we were, we were both sick together and we were like, this isn't fun. But yes, I planned on how to organize my craft stuff, but family wide COVID outbreak got in the way of actually implementing it. Everybody's okay now.
I'm glad to hear that everybody's okay, Chin Toss. And also, yeah, everybody on my side of the family is okay too. I haven't given any updates on that. So we're all good. But then also connection check, green check mark, the assignments and exams were submitted on time.
Uni is now done now on to the future. That is massive, massive congratulations. I didn't realize like university was completely done. I just thought it was like semester done. So I don't even have enough volume in my voice to like celebrate this. So know that I'm jumping up and down for joy inside.
But if I do that on the recording, both Kathy and Javier will be very upset with me. I mean, Javier would be more upset because I'm also jumping up and down, but not making noise on the recording. So I'm very, very excited. I just muted and jumped up and down for joy inside. And then I'm muted.
There you go. Perfect. We all celebrated with you. Oh, and no sponsor today, but that's okay. We're going to dive right into the topic. Or did you want to do another bit for the member section or? I want to I never read the ads. So I actually wrote this ad.
So today's sponsor is everyone listening live, become a member today at relay.fm slash conduit. You may wonder what you get for supporting conduit. Well, you get access to all the things from relay fm switch on.
Like the crossroads feed, full of bonus content and access to the relay fm switch on discord. Also, if you support at the conduit link by going to relay.fm slash conduit, I'm being told something. It's actually called the crossover feed. I'm sorry. Javier.
Javier, just throw some AI on there and fix it in post. Don't do that. Please. You can keep my mistakes in. I just don't do that for the record. I did not proofread this section. So you get all the errors as I wrote them. Also, if you support at the conduit link that is relay.
fm slash conduit, you are showing us that you want to see the show continue to develop and grow. And if we get enough people supporting us, we can look at doing more events like ice cream socials and special episodes in the future. And these things take a lot of work to put in place.
And we can't do it without the support. Also know that Jay has a ban on editing the show because he will nitpick it and is often too busy to do so. And then he'll get stressed out. He'll get burned out.
And your support doesn't only support us, but it also helps us to pay our wonderful editor, Javier, whom we love dearly. So support the three of us and keep J from editing and burning out by becoming a member today at relay.fm slash conduit. That's so good. Good job, Jay.
I'm so proud of you with that ad read. Well done. I did my best. You did great. You did great. And now we're going to jump into the topic, which is making do with what you have. The show makes you with Tiff Arment and Julius Scott. No, just kidding. We are not stealing this from them.
We are not doing their show, which is fantastic if you haven't listened to it. Please go check out Make Do with Tiff and Julia. Even if you're not creative, you will be so inspired to try something for fun. It's incredible. But what we are talking about is dealing with what you have.
There are so many things that you, oh, if I just have a better camera, I can take better pictures. Or if I have a faster computer, I will finally edit video. If only I had an Apple Pro display, I would actually know I'm kind of actually content with my LG 5K. Take that, you ATP. I'm kidding.
We are not pulling down other podcasts. We are here to support other podcasts. Absolutely. Take that, ATP.
But anyway, there was a huge part of this that kind of focuses on me and my job because, as we mentioned in the last episode, there's been a lot of effort for me to like get off the ground running, do all this stuff, make some videos, do TikTok, do all these stuff, do all these things.
Unfortunately, I'm working with a Mac Mini that I got in 2018, I think. I think it was 2018. Something like that. It's an Intel device that doesn't have a lot of power on it. If I try to do too much like Open Logic, my computer crashes.
So we've kind of been wanting to talk about how do we make do with what we have, but also communicate to the folks that rely on us to make end do that we kind of can't at the moment.
But Kathy, I remember you saying when we were talking about planning this, was you not only have to make do with what you have, you also have to make do with what other people have or don't have? A lot of times people that I will work with are at a certain level in their career.
The things that they have are not necessarily the goals and future and ideals of what they would like to have. And so they have to make do with what they do have. This really was big when I worked exclusively with photographers.
Photographers are even more like gear hungry than quote unquote regular tech people because there's always new cameras, new lenses, all of the goodies to come in and buy. And so I would have people say, oh, you know, I'm saving for 24 to 70 lens right now.
I have as my 50 and it's like, well, you're making money using the 50. Your income will not necessarily change if you change lenses unless you also are using it to make a difference in what you are offering, what you are providing.
Coming, do it, my journey of business ownership and things that I've done has come from making very, very little and working a regular job to where I am at now, which is not that.
And working with what I had and only being able to have what I was working with kind of changed my mindset into even now when yes, I could if I really wanted to, I could buy, you know, the Mac studio and the studio pro display and be fine. My family would still eat. But I don't need it.
My iMac Pro, you know, the last Intel version or whatever, it works great. It does exactly what I need it for, especially since I'm not editing video anymore, so I don't have to fight it. It does exactly what I need it to do.
And instead, I'm just going to save that money and do other things, you know, for the future. And I also, last year, did upgrade my camera body to a very nice camera.
And I justified it because of the, like, things that I was using it for and the reasons it doesn't really matter because it's not, you know, this isn't that show.
But my limitations that I was finding with the gear that I currently had on top of the fact that I found something for a very good discount allowed myself to mentally give permission. But I know that it took that additional, like, oh, this is on sale for me to allow myself to buy something.
As a creator, I can definitely speak to the idea of putting cost in comparison to equipment. And we often use that as a limiter to the things that we create and their value, being someone who podcasted for the first several years of my podcasting career.
I strictly would blame, like, oh, well, the audio quality isn't great because I'm talking out of a blue Yeti or there's other thing. And I hear, I hear people talk about that all the time.
I hear people who are professional podcasters, you know, complain about, oh, well, the first thing you need to do is upgrade your microphone. And one, I will say that everybody recording this is in a wonderful place of privilege to where we can do that.
But also some of my favorite conversations now come from Twitter spaces, which require you to talk through your phone. And I don't know how many people have tried to connect, like, a wave XLR or, you know, Charlotte, whatever, whatever into their phone, but it does not work that well.
That sounds horrific. Exactly. And I've seen so many people, and I've acknowledged so many people who actually charge more because of the limited technology that they have and their ability to still put out amazing quality in spite of it.
I mean, I've something I've been on a kick of lately is watching people on, it's called so expensive. And I can't remember. I think it's from business insider, their YouTube channel.
And the entire, like, premise of the show is like, why are these things so expensive? Like why is this mirror $50,000 when it's a handheld mirror?
Like, and it's because it's literally made using mud and clay and like copper from the ground and into like these things that are strung together with code hangers and it's a family tradition and they've been doing it this way for generations.
And they're really good at perfecting what they've been able to do with what they have in that it's considered the best mirror zero distortion that you can buy.
And in my mind, I feel like if we stopped looking at the tools that we have as the reason why we can't do a thing and instead start looking at how do we create quality content within the boundaries of what we do have. Yes. And I think that gives us the justification to charge even more.
In fact, I've done that. I've looked at like, hey, this is what it takes for me to make this. This is the time that it takes to make this. If I'm charging you based on the hour, you're not paying me anything. So I need to increase my rates on like freelance work.
And people were like, oh, well, I love the quality of work that you put out and I didn't realize how much time it was taking you. So yes, I will indeed pay you more for it. Yes. Yeah.
It's interesting to be able to like use that as a way to validate, justify, isn't the right word because whatever you charge is the great thing to charge unless you are charging too little. And then I'm going to tell you to raise your prices.
But being able to say, oh, I don't have the best equipment doesn't mean that what you are providing is not fantastic. Like John Bo says in the chat content over quality, over sound quality specifically.
And I'm thinking about podcast specifically and the fact that most of the time people can't tell the difference between good and great audio quality.
Like you can hear if somebody, you can usually hear somebody's using like an AirPods, not AirPods, the AirPods with the like string microphone going on because like it'll hit things and like rustle and and and whatnot.
But most of the time people can't tell the difference between a blue Yeti and whatever fancy microphone Marco is saying, especially. Take the ATP. Especially if somebody doesn't have good microphone etiquette.
So there's always something that you can learn and work on regardless of whatever equipment that you have. Some of the best photos aren't like from a fancy camera, you can get incredible photos with your iPhone.
Obviously, I can't take dance photography with my phone because it will not give me what I need in the low light fast moving, etc. But if I'm taking a beautiful picture of the sunrise outside, yeah, that's going to be great. It's going to be the perfect thing that I'm looking for.
And that definitely talks to kind of the second part of that conversation. Being realistic with the people that whether you report to them, whether you're client, whether they're a customer or a manager, sometimes you do need the equipment to do the thing that they want you to do.
And I will say that in most cases, asking will definitely get you the thing that you're looking for faster than not asking. As we as we mentioned, like just in this moment of, I got hired to make video content, to make audio content, to be able to edit and do all of these things.
And one of the conversations that had to happen very early was, here are the tools that I need. If you want me to put out this level of content that you're asking for in this format, in this method, then yes, I need the tools that are going to make that possible.
And it's, there's a balance of what can I do with what I have, but also what do I need to be realistically able to do these things.
And I feel like this is such a good conversation to continue on with the folks over at Make Do because they have adjusted, they have created things based on what is available to them.
And they've also looked at like, if I want to go and do this other thing, there's going to be stuff that I have to get. Working to that point, doing things to get to that point. And the nice part of that is what they didn't have never stopped them from making or doing.
It just meant that they had to make and do things different, or they had to make a different thing or do a different thing to get to that point. And that's just something that I genuinely believe that we often block ourselves from making or doing because we're like, oh, well, I don't have this.
Well, they make or do something else with what you have. I mean, I give Kathy all the props of like, Kathy is able to do so many wonderful TikTok ideas with the equipment that she has.
And could she do other stuff? Could she do the fancy shots of walking through New York City and asking people to do photo shoots? I'm not sure, but Kathy doesn't have the location that is New York City. So there's a lot of things that you can't do.
You can't put up a skyline when you're not in the city and there's no skyline around you. Or you can't put up the Empire State Building unless you're willing to fly to Vegas and get really creative with scale.
So yeah, I just think that this here was kind of a reminder to me of like, hey, your team wants you to do a thing and having a real and open conversation about like, hey, I don't know if you've heard, but there's like a chip shortage.
So getting my fancy Mac studio with all the chips and all the rams and all the GPUs and things, probably going to be a bit. But in the meantime, here's what we can be doing in the meantime, here's what we can create outside of that and also asking what other tools and resources are available to me.
Yes. In the chat, Sky says something that they keep selling telling to themselves that you have a voice and making your voice heard leaves an impact on the world no matter how small that impact is the exact methods of how you get out there don't matter as much as the act of getting it out.
And this is so true, whether it's in a podcast, TikToks, random photos, blog posts, whatever you are creating and however you are creating it is valid and can be beautiful and contribute to the world.
And then if you think nobody's looking at it or if nobody is actually seeing it because you know, it's in a sketchbook at home.
But the active you putting that onto paper is changing who you are as a person and the creativity that you are creating allows you to put that out into the world in a different way.
And so what we're saying is don't wait to start until you have the perfect equipment but figure out what you can do with the stuff that you have to make something beautiful for the world. And the last bit for me is even if it's bad, make it bad.
I mean, I tell people, I love that I'm a professional podcaster in more than one way. Like I get, you know, I'm a professional podcaster on Relay FM. This is, you know, that whole thing.
But then also I've gotten jobs and they've said, hey, we hired you because you're a good interviewer or you know how to do podcasting and we want to get into that game. So we're going to let you guide us in how to do it. But you're also on a payroll.
And I'm like, that's amazing of like I work for the man. Yes, I am okay with that because I am now a professional podcasters in my, my own unique way while also being a professional podcasters.
So like it's, it's really cool to be like, I don't think the stuff that I made was horrible but I also don't think that it was like the best quality ever. It's not on, you know, the New York Times or Vox media or I heart radio or whatever. It was like I liked making a thing.
So I just made the thing. And then I said, I want to do this professionally and then someone was like, yo, you want to, you want to get a paycheck while doing this and getting better at doing it? And I was like, uh, okay. Sure. Like that. That sounds great. Like I, I like money. Yeah. That's. Yeah.
And, and I guess, you know, when you don't tie yourself to what you're making or doing as much, it, it makes it easier to, to do that. Um, just tying back to one of the connections that we had of like, it's been great getting back into work but also not going overboard with it. Yeah.
So being able to say like, if it takes me longer to do a thing because I don't have the equipment, well then vocalizing it and just saying like, well, you got two options. You can either spend the money and like get it for me.
You can pay me more so I can get it for myself or we can work within the boundaries of what I'm doing. Yes. Yeah. I, uh, absolutely.
 And I think it's, whatever your situation is, um, just taking a moment to, to think about where you're at, you can absolutely dream and plan out and think about where you want to be, but looking at where you're at right now and seeing what you can do with what you have, um, can also help you not only be able to like really work using what you have, but also when you do get to the point that you have something, you know, fancy or nice or more expensive, whatever, you're able to appreciate it more because you know why you wanted that thing.
If that makes sense. That said, Kathy, I think I know what I want to do for my connection. Oh, do tell because it's time for our connections to come. So I'm, I'm going to use my platform selfishly and say that I am going to talk to Kathy and I will release one video on TikTok. Just one.
Just so excited. I have no idea what it will be. That's okay. That's okay. I am definitely pushing myself on this because, uh, unlike some of our folks on, uh, analog and yes, I listened to all of the relay FM shows switch on. I don't feel like I'm too old for TikTok. So, uh, yes.
And also I want to be able to support my friends who feel like they may need to use TikTok to advance their businesses and advance their stuff. So, uh, people give me ideas on what to do for TikTok. Dancing will not be allowed. I don't even have to dance. It's totally fine.
And you know what, on that same vein, um, I am going to try and I'm going to work on getting back to my daily TikToks. I took a break because it was not enjoying me as much. I haven't even like watched as many TikToks. I haven't really been a part of it, but I have started to miss that creation.
So, after, you know, I did daily TikToks for two years. It was going to be just a two week plan, you know, during lockdown and two years later, I guess what, COVID still exists. But I, I think I'd like to get back into, um, that sort of creation.
So, um, I think maybe next episode will be more TikTok related. Oh, wow. The TikTok episode. Yes. Yes. Was we have to talk to clockwise about that? Oh, my goodness. Uh, keep watching the clock. We're just stealing all of this stuff.
That said, if you have, uh, we have a few friends that do make things, um, I will not always promote their stuff on TikTok. But if I have it or if I can get it and you want some free advertisement from someone that has your own followers, uh, yeah, let me know.
That'll give me at least an idea of where to start. So, started at the beginning and work your way up. Exactly. Uh, and also that means you get, you get all the bad stuff for free while no one's watching and then I get better at it. Yeah, because practice makes perfect.
And you can't, you gotta start to get started. Okay, so we've got two TikTok connections in, in the works. Um, what, oh, never mind. This is your show. Yeah, this is my stuff stealing my show, Jay. Man. But, uh, hey, look, it's time for our conductors connections.
Um, did you start last time? Do you want to start again? Nope, that was you. Okay, then you start this time so that we have different connections for our different peoples.
Cool, the soprano of the show, Deborah, says, next connection, plan a retirement party for my church organist and choir master who's retiring after 29 years at that job. Whoa, that's awesome.
And I love church organs, um, growing up in the south, I think I had a different kind of church organ, uh, in mind, but I also like those church organs too.
Uh, so I think this is going to be great and ain't no party like a retirement party because retirement party, uh, is the stopping of you going to work every day. So yes. Yeah. I love it. I'm so excited to hear how it goes.
All right, uh, Ryan's our fancy boy, sorry, our fancy music boy of the show, um, his connection is to get through this semi last minute road trip to New Mexico. Um, and now, um, I'm going to go to the next one.
And now, uh, spoiler for the discord conversation, the reason that he is on a semi last minute road trip is very on brand because he's doing something fancy with his fancy boy music instrument.
Um, I don't remember what it is, but it's hilarious, uh, that this is why he is taking a road trip to New Mexico. So I believe that you can do it and you can travel. Next are guitar.
So the show Scott says new connections again, one in fitness run three times a week with at least one of those being a 5K. I think he has already done this, uh, but since he's not here, he's going to do it again.
Um, and then to learn logic, the recycled connection to at least take baby steps in learning logic. Uh, Scott, let's, let's work on re phrasing this to be learn a thing about logic or learn a thing in logic.
That way, you don't feel like you have to complete the entire process, but you can just take a step in the right direction. Yeah. Like a very, like pick one thing, um, and, and that's a great place to start. And I'm going to not sing, um, for the song from, uh, whatever, uh, sound of music.
That's the song that I'm not going to sing. Um, instead, I am going to go to so, uh, oracle of the show. Uh, their next connection is to prepare for a panel. They're speaking on that they're a little bit scared about. Fight that imposter syndrome. Absolutely. You can do it.
But a cleaning project part two is go through all of their bags and give away the ones you don't use. Oh, by goodness, I have such a hard time, um, with this, uh, with bags, I collect bags and I need to get rid of them. So, um, I definitely, uh, feel you on that.
I, uh, believe in you, you can do it. And then once we unmute, we have the dragon of a color that will not be referenced.
Uh, no, our, our blue dragon of the show, uh, Skylar says figure out the next year's situation at college and iron out some complications that they have come, or that have come up recently. Uh, complications are always complicated and, uh, good luck with, uh, uncomplicating them, but you can do it.
And of course, we are always here for support in, uh, that help. I'm sorry for all of the complications, especially emotional ones that's so rough, but yeah, we are definitely here for you.
And our tire advocate of the show, Chintas, uh, their next connection is finally managed to find someone to hand off, but of my, uh, handoff, okay, they managed to find someone to hand off their job too.
So, they need to document everything to pass it on and hopefully in two weeks, they'll have more time to do the bits of the job they actually enjoy. Oh, handoff bits of the job. That makes sense. I, words are hard.
Words are very hard, um, but I love this idea of documenting what you do, um, and being able to create systems and processes and pass that on, not just for your, like, not just for others, but for yourself as well. Like that's really great.
And then our, our, all of the show, Kate says their connection, keep working on the deadlines. Uh, my final master's project is due by the end of the month.
So still working flat out on that consistency is key and being able to check back in with this week by week, uh, as you continue to push through that process is great.
Honestly, I need to start making like micro connections that are just do the thing that you said you needed to do because I constantly put things off, uh, until later. Yeah.
Uh, and this is another good, I a good example of like a long term connection that's, you know, steadily checking in, letting us know how it's going because we're here to support them. Um, but also you're almost done. Kate, you could do it. All right. You mean you can't do it. Yes, you can do it.
Uh, rails of the show, Dave, their new connection time, time to start the process of getting into the world of being high-robo. Uh, they're going to watch some content to start the IT certification certificate train.
Uh, and maybe actually do the thing that they said that they would delay and start tracking them side projects. Uh, yes, track the side projects, do the side projects, make money from side projects or not make money from the side projects. All are valid. You come to it.
And you may have heard some typing and that's because we got some new conductors listening to the show. Uh, the what's his face of the show? What's he says? I don't know what I'm doing, but hey, I'm starting a new job next week. My goal is don't mess up. Uh, yeah. Right there. Right there with you.
I am in week two of new job. We have some other folks that are in like week three and week four. Uh, very much don't mess up is the name of the game and you can mess up in plenty of ways. The one bit of advice I can throw at you.
Don't do what I did and show that you can do a lot more than you, uh, want to be responsible for doing one weekend. So yeah, you couldn't do this. Face yourself. Make, make some low expectations to start so that you can surpass them when you want to.
And keep it steady so you're not over working yourself right off the bat. Oh, good. What's he says that they made that mistake in the last role? So they know not to do it again. So kind of you. Sadly, I made that mistake in the last role as well and thought I was doing a good job.
Uh, and then, and then I goofed. I was okay though. Got one little fight. My mom got scared. Oh, that's wrong. That's the wrong thing. If you would like to submit a connection, you can do so on Twitter by tweeting at conduit FM using the hashtag my conduit.
Or if you hang out in the relay FM switch on discord, um, you can go into the show follow up, uh, channel and put in our fancy conduit logo and then type in your connection and it will feed into the spreadsheet.
And you can also anywhere in there, uh, go question mark my conduit all one word, um, in the discord and it will also feed it into the magical spreadsheet because our developer of the show, uh, Maddie B is incredible.
Um, and uh, it looks like, uh, we've got a last minute connection from our dice of the show James, uh, who says that, uh, his connection will be to think of a connection for next time. I love that. Love James and I love all of you.
So thank you, everyone, for, uh, joining us on this episode of conduit. And I apparently switched into friends in your ears mode there for a second. So it happens when I have finished that show in a while. I will start it saying go to friends in your ears. Come. That's not the show.
I think there's one question you might want to ask though. I think that sounds like a great idea. Uh, hey, Jay, did we conduit? I mean, we didn't have all the tools we wanted to, uh, but I think we made do and did conduit.
