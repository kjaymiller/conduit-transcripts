From Relay FM. Welcome to Condoit, the show that is here even if we're not actually here. I'm Kathy and I am the only one here today and it's going to be a short one.
This is difficult for us to do but sometimes life comes in and one of the biggest things that we do here at Condoit is make sure that we give you permission for give yourself for being human.
Whether the situation that you're in or the body that you're living in or whatever is happening is going to be a living we're all doing the best that we can and sometimes that means that some things have to change or we have to make adjustments for that.
In this case that is not doing a full episode.
Jay is currently sick with no voice and originally I was just going to have a guest and I currently have a family situation happening that is making it difficult to spend the time at home to do this recording in addition to not being able to find a guest.
However when this situation came about I hadn't found a guest yet and that's okay. So instead what I'm going to do is say thank you so much for listening. Thank you for being a part of the community and we appreciate you so much.
This will give you an opportunity to either expand your connection for the next fortnight or you can also pick a new connection. Either way we appreciate you. We love you. We thank you for being here and we cannot wait for the next episode in two weeks.
So in the future if you would like to submit a connection you can do so by visiting myconnectioncheck.com. Make sure to include your of the show name and both your current and next connection to submit it via feedback. I am a superconductor.

And did we conduit? I'm going to say no we did not conduit but that's also okay. So thank you so much for listening and we'll see you back again real soon.
