 From Relay FM, you're listening to Conduit, the show where we condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that has some anxiety, but guess what, it's going to be fine. I'm Kathy and with me today is Jay, but Jay is not in his normal spot. So if the headphones, because of course he left his other headphones in a lift probably, and is trying to charge, yeah, you know what, it's going to be fine. It's going to be fine. Hi Jay. I know for a fact I had them on the plane, and I think I had them in the company office that I had to go to, and I'm hoping that maybe just maybe they're sitting in the company office. At least then I could say, hey, can you all send those to me? Yeah. Because they're in a lift. They're gone forever. Yeah, probably, but hopefully the headphones that you're using right now are definitely not going to die before the show. Yeah, and I'm doing the smart thing of I'm only using one ear. Oh nice. And I can just put the other ear in. Perfect. Love it. Let's see how this goes. So as we were talking a little bit in the pre-show, what went on at co-working? Because I was only there for a part of a time because I was stuck with a bridge that apparently is a drawbridge that I forgot is a drawbridge because it's never open. Well, we talked about a lot. There is a lot of talking. Normally, sometimes it's quiet, and it felt quiet, but it also felt like there was a lot of talking to you. So in this last co-working, Kathy was stuck on a bridge. We got to see said stuck bridge. Yep. That was fun. Home lab, it's a hashtag, or is it a lifestyle? I don't know. I'm still figuring that out. Meeting people at Taco trucks, because that's the best way to meet people is with tacos. Obviously. Empathy in the global news. That was, yeah, you kind of need that. Yeah. The news kind of sucks, and it sucks to hear, but it sucks even more for the people who are actively involved. So empathy in the global news. The death of MTV. Yes, I was here. Apparently more than everyone else. No, no, no, no, I was here for this part of the conversation, and I was shocked that it was still around, honestly. Yep. My new cat is a jerk, by the way. Today, we officially adopted said cat, since cat was technically a foster. But now it is a forever cat. Not a forever cat. Yeah, foster fail, because now it's adopted. And then we tried to convince people to maybe buy a 3A printer, because we're bad influences, but it's okay. Because these 3D printers are good. So, yes, for a forever cat, even though said cat is a jerk, said cat literally would come into the office, and then when I would try to show him off, he would run all the office. That sounds about right. That is a jerk. Yeah, like most cats, but that's okay, because cats teach you consent, which is. The cat also tries to bite my hair, and it's annoying. Oh, yeah, that less great. But understandable. You will attack my head, please. Yeah. Yeah. Good times. Good times. Hold on, we've got a last minute connection. Thanks, nameless. Well, if all of that fun stuff sounded fun to you, any of those topics you have thoughts on, you should join us in co-working by becoming a super conductor. Go to I'm a superconductor.com. That's letter I, letter I, letter I, superconductor.com, and become a member today. Yes. As a cell cat, he's select all. That's okay. Yeah, it's fine. Everything's fine. What is your one good thing? What is my one good thing? My one good thing was going to be that I didn't lose my headphones. I had a really good sandwich while I was here. Shout out to sweet bird. Or sorry, street bird. In Washington, DC, it is a really good chicken sandwich. They also have cornbread, like, and it is the biggest piece of cornbread I have seen. It's a fast casual restaurant. It was so good. The coleslaw was even good. I'm really picky when it comes to coleslaw, but this coleslaw, very good. Oh, interesting. I wish I liked coleslaw. I'm picky on the coleslaw. I feel like the tangyness of coleslaw is very important to get right. It can't be too tangy. It can't be not tangy at all. It has to have a little hit to it. They did pretty good. Overall, it's still fast casual food. I'm not on the fast casual scale. I would give it a 9 out of 10. But out of food, I would probably give it a 7 out of 10. Okay. That's good. I don't know if anyone could hear this. It almost sounds like a hiccup. The past guy is here putting stuff around our house. And Ophelia has a lot to say about it. But she needs to stay in here so she doesn't mess with them. Or the stuff, but she has opinions. So I am sorry if you hear her in the recording. But you know what? That's fine. We're going to keep going. We're going to keep rolling because that's how we're rolling. My one good thing is my kiddo and I at Mini Soup and I are doing more cooking together. They wanted to try some recipes. And so we're trying it. It's much more fun to cook with someone else in the kitchen. We made these sweet potato fritters, which were really, really good with some chopped up kale in it too. It was delicious. So I love that. That sounds amazing. Amazing. My kid tries to cook and it causes problems. Well, your kid is also a lot younger. I think when I got when I was traveling to Chicago, when I got home, apparently, Brittany and the kiddo decided to make cakes. And then like they had made a cake once and it was really, really good. And for like a week after that, she wanted to make a cake every day. I mean, yeah, yeah, absolutely. Then she, but she didn't, she wasn't willing to be patient and wait. No, for other. Of course not. So we got like the icing with the raw egg in it. The random like cake batter that's like was half half brick. There was flour all throughout the house. Oh, no, this is. Oh, no. That's like I love the excitement, but also please put the things down. Yeah. Oh my goodness. That's crazy. Let's hop over to our connections. Zap, zap, zap, zap. Jay, how'd you do? Well, my connection was to start thinking about my JZ winners. And I did this and it's, this is going to be very in connection with, I guess, the topic uh, for this episode. Yeah. But while just thinking about this year and the things that happened in it, I was like, a lot has happened. Yeah. I've been, I've been around and I clearly see some very large gaps in and things. So yeah, that's, it's going to be tough. It's going to be, I, I haven't picked a winner, but I have picked the candidates. That's a good, yeah. That's all you needed to do though. That you needed to plan it, which is what that is. Yeah. So I have, I have my, my nominees. I kind of know who the winners will be. Uh, I think for the first time, there will be a winner who will not be notified that they are a winner. Oh. Because they are a, I don't know, they're a celebrity, but they are a professional of sorts who, like, I don't have a way of being like, hey, congratulations. Yeah. Is it 50? Is it 50, 50 cent? Because that was not 50 cent. That was a winner. Um, anyways, what about our conductors? How did they do? No, what about you, Gat? Oh, yeah. I totally forgot. It's fine. We can talk about me a little bit. I, my connection was to put up some pictures on a gallery wall. Now that my big shelf fell. And we did that. And we did it instead of like doing any sort of planning, many soup and I sat and we just put, we knew that what picture we wanted to have in the center. And then we just kind of put up others. And it's chaotic in the best way. Nothing matches. Nothing is level. Oh, well, it's, the each individual photo is, picture is level, but they're not like lined up at all. And so we can just add things or take things away really easily. And it makes me really happy. And then I have another wall that I think I'm going to fill out to, um, but I haven't decided yet. But either way, it makes me happy. And that is great. What about our conductors? Um, our checklist, the use of the show, Mike, said green check ready for the holiday season and end of the year. Honestly, I thought this connection would end much closer to the holidays. But I did get some stuff planned for the end of the year. Awesome. Amazing. Our soprano of the show debos says green heart. And we decided to take a trip to Charleston for New Year's. And I just booked the flight hotel and several dinner reservations. That'll be so fun. I love that. And our tech podcast listener of the show Pillix says, uh, red circle, I for core. Yeah. Does okay. That's okay. We're here to support you because you're here now. And that is what matters. Uh, our identical twin of the show, Aaron says connection check green circle barring any last minute things I wrapped up my freelancing for the year. As always, they were gracious and happy with my work. Yes. That's amazing. We love a supportive clients. Our oracle of the show. Sof says tree November was busy. And as I expected, I drink water, move the body and breathe. And I'm still here. That's, I love it. Drink water, move the body, breathe. I think that's, that's a, you get that tattoo. It's like live laugh love. Move drink. Yeah. That is something that I would put on my wall. Our artist of the show, Carly says yellow square. I had my passport photo taken, but I still need to figure out where to submit the paperwork. Hey, that's more than I've done. Yeah, I need to, uh, so I still need to get my photos done because every time I try, it doesn't work out, but that's fine. I gotta get mine renewed for next year. Yeah. We're doing great. Um, the, uh, of the show, uh, says connection check green check mark got my snow tires on about three days before the big snowfall. Yay. Our robotics engineer of the show, Aiden says red circle the last two weeks were too hectic to manage routines. So I didn't even bother. That's also okay. Absolutely. Our kid, our Canadian trivia card enthusiast of the show Erica says connection check yellow heart. I only got one episode of we contain multitudes edited health issues kept me from doing the second episode, but I've lots of lead time. So I'm not worried. Yes. And that is why, uh, it's all about pacing so that you can do the things that you need to do, um, and give yourself space as well. Oh, there's more isn't there. Yes. Yes. Because it's the mountain dweller of the show. I can't yell. I mean, I will tell. Okay. I still did it. Green heart. I got out for dinner with at my best friend's house, asked my parents for help and took a lot of rest time because I'm sick. It still counts. Yes. Absolutely still counts. The nameless of the show nameless says connection check green tree. I got the Christmas decor out and Mrs. nameless and I have decorated the house. We have started the gift shopping as well now to get it done in time. You can do it. Ray, you can do it. Magnifique. Okay. So it's time for the topic, which is, uh, I, I texted Jay and I was like, okay, remind me because I knew that our last two episodes of the year had topics, but I couldn't remember which order it was and the way I said it was wrong. We're going to do it the correct way, which makes sense because today we're going to talk about our future goals. Life, planning things, end of the year, yada yada. I know you don't do yearly themes and that's fine because I do. So we can talk about that. But what's kind of on your mind for this end of the year, as things start to kind of slow down for the year and get ready for the new year? Um, the end of the year, this is, this is kind of an interesting point for me because the end of the year feels very, I was so worried like I'm, I'm so excited to be taking a break, but at the same time, I'm also just, I don't know, I'm, I'm kind of at a point where I'm like super excited for like all the things happening, but then I'm also so tired, just, just absolutely so, so, so tired. And I know that I tend to not be a big holidays person. Just due to some, some trauma stuff that I have dealt with in that time, but I'm very much trying to make sure that I'm not pushing that on everyone else. I'm trying to make sure that everyone else is having a good time. I want to make sure that everyone else is enjoying like all the stuff. And it feels like, wow, I can't even or odd right now. Like I can't think straight, I can't sit down for five minutes and process things, but I know that I have the next two weeks off. So I'm looking, I'm looking forward to that so much. What about you? How is, how's the end of the year looking for you? Yeah, not as joyful as yours. I'm trying to, because I still have work, like I am taking several days to not do work, but I still have things to get done. But I did get my theme for the new year. And it is the year to be selfish. Selfish, yes, can be a bad word. It can be an insult, can be whatever, but I really need permission to choose myself in a lot of times. And this past year, my, my theme was connection, the year of connection. And I feel like it really, really worked in a way that hasn't since the year to bloom, which was several years ago. I think almost five, it was what five years ago, I think, because that year, the year that I did the year to bloom was the year that we started conduit. And so that was almost five years ago. I thought that was the year of joy. Or was that the year after? I think. Yeah, that was the year after. It's been two years. I know. I keep thinking that. It's, it's, but it's fine. It's fine. We're here. I, the, the, towards the last part of this year, I've started trying to give myself permission to do things for me in a way that has felt very negative and selfish for the past. And I think, oh, yeah, nameless, I think the year of joy was 2020. I think that's correct. Because that's, I was that joyful. It was not. But that's okay. You know what? We, we hung in there. We did, we did the things. Yeah. Yeah. But so the, the last part of this year, specifically been working in therapy about it, you know, making choices for me, not necessarily what's best for other people, not discounting or like ignoring the other people in my life and, and that sort of thing. But making sure that I can choose some priorities for myself. I don't have specific things for this theme yet. But I have my sign on the wall with the reminder. And in it, I have a quote of Brianna Weist wrote a book. And this is a quote from that. It says, love yourself enough to create an environment in your life that is conducive to the nourishment of your personal growth. Allow yourself to let go of the people, thoughts and situations that poison your well-being cultivate a vibrant surrounding and commit yourself to making choices that will help you release the greatest expression of your unique beauty and purpose. And I feel like that really hit in a way that feels really good to me. And that's kind of, it's a little bit more than like a tagline and it's a little bit more than specifics. So I can use that as my defining factor. So is this something that will help me cultivate the surrounding and make sure that I'm reminding that I am living my life and I need to choose myself sometimes. And part of that was, for example, and kind of what brought this good idea to me was when buying my car, when choosing a car that what I wanted. I've been wanting a mini for a while. I'm a mini Cooper. And when we ended up getting earlier this year, getting a car for mini soup, that was not going to be like a taller car. Basically, things worked out where I was like, I need to be able to have a car that I can take Mr. Super round and be able to get them to doctor's appointments and stuff. And I realized that the need for getting a vehicle that is tall enough for the one to two times a year does not necessarily need to be the main point. Like I can get my spouse in and out of my car. It's not super comfortable and it takes a little effort. But there's not enough appointments that this needs to be the main priority. So I am okay getting a smaller car. That makes me happy because I'm the one that's going to be driving it most of the time. I'm the one that's going to be in and out. And that kind of tipped off the idea to have that be my theme. And I'm actually, I've been sitting with it for a little bit. And I feel really good with it. It's the exact definition of kind of what a theme is. Kind of guardrails to help make decisions in your year. And so yeah, we'll see, we'll see how it goes. I love the idea of, you know, I'm going to think about myself when I'm making these decisions. This is, this has been kind of an ongoing conversation that I've had with some folks about just how we operate in the nonprofit thing. Like I put out a post last earlier last month that was like, hey, you know, basically it's a wrap for 2025. We raised about, you know, I think it was like, like $14,000 or something like that. That's amazing. And we were able to sponsor 20 events. So that, you know, that these moments that were very much like, oh, wow, like I'm so happy that we were able to do what we could do. And there was a lot of thought around like, hey, there are so many more events that happen around the world. Yeah. That we don't support. That the reason that we don't support them is that we don't know they exist. Yeah. Like it's that simple. It's like, we can't. We had two choices. We could invest a lot of time and energy reaching out to events as they popped up on the internet and saying, hey, we want to give you money and hey, we want to do all these things. Or we could do maybe a more realistic idea, which would be we can, if you reach out to us, that we can help you. But you have to reach out to us. Yeah. We have to know about it. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. So are you going to be in kind of this idea for the future? Are you going to be kind of trying to see how you can get that word out to other people? Like for next year to kind of make it like, yes, knowing that you can only do what you can do. Like, not like what you've done is fantastic and it should not be minimized by any means. But are you going to take that into account and see about possibly doing some more outreach type things to get it to get more to help or more words or anything? Glad you. Yeah. There is there is kind of a conversation around our social media like engagement and stuff. We are going to probably try to do a little bit more of a, hey, let's plan out some social media stuff to let people know that we are available to let people know that like this is what we do, to let people know that hey, you should donate because that money is the collection of small $5 monthly donations to the nonprofit and stuff. Doing all of those things, there was originally a plan to hire someone to do it, but it just didn't make sense at the time. So kind of doesn't make sense. So now the plan is to, I know before I say this, people are going to throw up and their mouths a little bit to leverage AI because you know what you know what you can ask AI to do is say ask people for money in 12 different ways. Yeah. Generate, generate, you know, there's 52 weeks in a year. Generate at least like half of that. You know, at least give me 26 ways to ask people to donate and to tell people that you know we're available for to support them if they need support and they're helping communities of black Afro-Guration or I forgot there was a, I learned a new phrase and it explained what I was hoping to explain. I can't think of the word now. I'm going to have to go watch the video again. Basically folks of color around the world who are trying to get into development. I have no problem with that. Yeah. But yeah. So yes, there, this is also the year that I really start looking at the hey, you've got a maximum of two years left of me kind of at the top of this, making the city's. Yes. So start thinking about what that looks like with me not involved in the day to day. I'm already trying to get away from the day to day and it's more like the week to week. Yeah. But in two years it'll be I am an advisor. Feel free to reach out to me when you need help. I will be a participant. I will not be a leader in those spaces anymore because I want to do other things. There have been podcasts that I want to start that you know funny enough. I can't remember I mentioned this on the show or not, but someone was like, hey, you know, should, should you use a human editor? And I was like, yes. And in fact, I have an editor that I will use now for like all of my stuff as long as they are open to it. If you know, I will never edit my own stuff again because it's hard. It's hard to be thinking about that all the time. Yeah. And it'll prevent me from doing stuff. But I can't I can't start things right now because the anxiety that comes with being so busy and just having so much going on and then it would be like, and on top of that, I got to think about a second show. Like, no, that's not reasonable. That would be highly irresponsible. Yeah. It would. Don't do it. I've also been watching a ton of, you know, get ready for the near type YouTube videos, not as, oh my gosh, I'm going to pick this to do. But as a way to kind of, so I've been because I've been watching so many of them and I will just kind of write down if something kind of tickles my brain a little bit. And it's like, oh, this is a good idea. And so I'm kind of letting one of actually this makes sense for one of the biggest things that I've kind of learned in a couple different videos was kind of the power of the subconscious. And this idea of, so in the past, I've tried journaling and like doing it in the morning during the day type of a thing. And it's been good, but it's, but it's been difficult to kind of keep it going consistently. And so in two, again, two different videos that I watched, they were talking about the power of the subconscious and an idea of writing a letter to your subconscious every night before you go to bed or making, you know, doing a brain dump with kind of problems that you're trying to work through, things that you're trying to solve, and leaving it alone and letting it just kind of sit, specifically the one doing it night before you go to bed, being able to then let your subconscious work overnight and see what it can do and see what it can kind of trigger to think about when you wake up. And that's something that I'm going to try. I'm going to see how it works. I'm going to have my iPad next to my bed so that I can write on it even if the lights are off, because that's the most difficult thing really is if my spouse is asleep, I can't you know, turn the light on necessarily to do the writing for things. Although I might, I might see about getting a lamp that is on a dimmer. And yeah, we'll see it, we'll see how this works, but that's something that I kind of want to think about doing. But I got that because of all of these videos again, I'm not going into this knowing that oh, so and so's YouTube videos exactly what I want to do. I am giving myself permission to take what I want and leave what I don't and in knowing that you know, December is the best time for YouTube ads. It's not the best time for podcasts ads, but YouTube absolutely. Vlogmas is a thing where people post a video every day in December for a reason. Like that has happened for a reason. And so I'm aware of, you know, the marketing and an idea of, you know, all of these videos are coming out because people love to watch them and that sort of thing. But I like the idea of of pulling what I need and moving on with what I don't. And so we'll see, we'll see how it goes. And I hope that everyone else has some, some plans, even if all your only plan is to wake up every day. Love it. Great. My, my thing for November was, you know, getting through November. And I did. So, hooray. Love that for me. Yeah. Are you excited for the new year? Jay? No. Yeah. Fallon. I'm, I'm, it's funny that your theme is based on, I would say self-preservation, self-enjoyment, self-efficientist feels negative. So I'll throw some positivity in there. The, when, when I'm thinking about things at the moment, I feel very much like self-preservation. But also, I feel like next year will be the year that I let people down. And I, I will say that I will let them down in order to not let myself down. And like that, that might feel negative. But it just means that I'm not going to do nearly as much. I'm going to tell people, no, I'm more I'm going to not, or at least I hope that I won't sacrifice my own health to make others, you know, happy. So it'll, it'll, it'll feel, it'll be tough because I think that they're definitely some things that I'm like, I don't really want to go to this or I don't really want to participate in this. And some people are going to just be like, oh, that's so upsetting to hear. And it's like, well, it's, it's the reality. Someone else can do it. Yeah. It's, it need to be me. Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. All right. Well, what is your connection for the next time? I'm going to cheat a little bit. My connection is to prepare for the next episode because it is the second annual end of the year systems check review. We do four systems checks a year. And this is a good way to look back at the entire year and see what were we thinking about? How were we, how was our productivity growing or not growing or, or those things? Last year I pulled all the transcripts from the shows and did a bunch of stuff this year. I am doing the same thing, except I'm doing more work on the, the coding project that, that does all that and manages all of that in hopes that I can get it working in a different way, working like not better or worse, but working in a different way. And then we will take a look at the last three quarters of, or I guess last year, we'll look at like the review that we did last year, then we'll look at the last three quarters. And then we'll look at where we are now and how that will propel us into the future. Yeah. Into 2026. So yeah, that, that, that's, I don't have to do a lot of preparation for the show. This is like the one episode where it's like, oh crap, I have to actually do it. Right. You know, it's, it's the, it's kind of the one episode that you actually do some work on it. And that came out really, really shit, really back, really, really, completely, not doing work all year round. And then the one episode where I, I'm taking kind of the helm of it, it's so much work. I feel like they balance each other. Okay. You know, the, the 26, the 25 episodes that you do most of the work on versus the, the one really, really, really, really hard. This, this feels like traditional gender roles in a household where women are expected to do the constant daily, you know, dishes, laundry, cleaning, food, etc. And men come sweeping and they're like, I'm going to mow the lawn. And things are balanced. But that's, that's hilarious because I don't move. Either way, either way, good for you. I, it's, it's going to be an interesting two weeks. You know what, I'm going to do, I'm going to say that I'm going to do my subconscious night journaling thing. That's going to be conscious night journal. That's actually, you know what, actually, I'm going to get a dimming light for my desk and for my bedside table. That's going to be an easier thing to do. I, I, I, don't necessarily like to do, you know, buy a thing connection, but I feel like this might be something that needs to happen. So what about our conductors? Nothing for them. They're, they're doing absolutely nothing, the lazy bones. Our checklist enthusiast at the show, Mike says, clear the decks so I can spend the holidays with family and not worry. Yes. Good luck. Our soprano of the show debos says next connection, make many, many bows to help decorate the church for Christmas. Ooh, I hope you'll share in creativity. Our tech podcast listener of the show, Felix says, finish the project. I will message Kathy to ask questions. I feel like the last one. Listen, cook the snacks with grandma. Yeah. Oh, yeah, he foregore. That was the right. Our identical twin of the show, Aryan says new connection. Give my last couple of things wrapped this week and enjoy time with family bringing my girlfriend to me, my mom. So cross your fingers for me on it going, well, hey, you're going to do amazing. Your girlfriend's going to be amazing. Your mom's going to be amazing. It's all going to be good. I like it. The Oracle of the show says for the rest of December, I'm planning on doing less work. That's in asterisk. This is a love it. I need to finish up a couple of papers I've been writing and mostly I plan to drink mule wine and eat chocolate while listening to jingli jingli music while I'm pretending to think of a theme for next year. Oh, that sounds fun. You can do it. Our artist of the show, Carly says new connection. Start taking my job search more seriously. By that, I mean, applying to at least one job each weekday. I love the the guardrails and the boundaries in this. You can do it. Our shark of the show, Chris says my connection is to finalize my theme for next year. Love it. Well, will it be finalize what my theme will be? The uh of the show, uh, says new connection. Take it easy. My medical leave is about to end and I'm about to head back to work during the business time of the year for us. I'm going to take a deep breath and try not to get overwhelmed. Yes, take care of yourself. Our robotics engineer, the show Aiden says enjoy the time off work for the holidays. Yes. Our mountain doller of the show, Logan says next connection begin the hunt for a new job in earnest. Start by emailing an old professor of mine. Good luck. And our Canadian trivia card enthusiast of the show, Erica says, okay, this time I'm going to edit two episodes of We Can Multitudes probably. But I'm not going to spend my whole break editing. Good. Probably. You better not take that break. And last but not least, uh, the nameless of the show nameless, says new connection due to all the birthdays. I didn't redo the home office desk. So let's try again. Let's get this desk at a state that brings joy again. Also wrap the gifts. That sounds fantastic. You can do it.
