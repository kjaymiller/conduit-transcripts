From really FM, you're listening to Conduit, the show where we conduo our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that asks you to tell us how awesome we are so that maybe one day we'll believe it. This episode of Conduit is brought to you by Devon THINK.
I'm Kathy Campbell and I would like to introduce the most amazingness, human that is currently recording this show with me. For reasons that I can't say why he's so amazing, but spoiler alert, he's freaking amazing. Jay Miller. You forgot what I do for a living.
Okay now, just because I can't describe the intricacies of what you do, doesn't mean anything. Okay. I still can't tell you what my dad did for his job, even though he's been retired for like 10 years.
That's my goal in life, is that one day my kiddo will be like, oh my dad, I don't know, he does something like computers. To be fair, my parents also don't know what I do. So it's fine. It's cool. It's great. Isn't the future amazing? And you know what else is amazing? Shoutouts.
And we do shout outs from people doing amazing things in the relay FM community. You can join them by becoming a member at relay.fm slash Conduit. But Jay, do you have a shout out for us today? I do. It's a special one because they didn't tell us they were going to be in the chat.
Shout out to our good friend, the other host of the show. The one Alex Cox for doing the independence and going, going to independence is route. I picture you now in like that scene in Will Smith, or an Independence Day where Will Smith is like dragging an alien like in the desert.
Welcome to earth. Yeah. Yeah. No, go support all the things that they're doing. There's so many. We're going to put some in the show notes. Dubai Friday is one. We can't give you the whole URL, but there's a Patreon that goes with it. But again, do by Friday or patreon.
com slash do by Friday is the relay appropriate link to follow. There we go. The other one. Yes. And there's other shows like Roboism. That one that the amazing Kathy Campbell. I don't know if you know her. She's amazing. And they're fine. Yeah.
We're going to be promoting each other a lot, maybe not like in terms of the links and stuff, but definitely pumping each other up because we're talking about devil spaghetti today. Anyway, that's my shout out. So yeah, shout out to the one, the Alex Cox and Kathy, what about you? Yeah.
So my shout out is for Chris Farrell or for all. I never know how to pronounce the last name, but we've been Twitter Mutuals for a while. And he wanted to share about forces pertaining to vices.
So our episode last time talked about our newest acronym because apparently that's what we do is we make up acronyms to help you through your daily life. And in making the acronym vice, we realized how little information we actually knew about the science behind compression and tension.
So Chris was kind enough to let us know that vices use compressive forces that are commonly called load and tension is a pulling force also called load, not confusing at all. But the physicist at the show has like at least started to explain to us what it does.
All I need to know is that I put the clampy thing together and I rotate it and it squeezes. Right. That's all I need to know. Yep. And there's something about managing loads and being able to keep things under control with vices. Yeah.
Which by the way, a side shout out to someone that after explaining vices to them, they thought I was talking about like my Oh, no habits like addictions and things. I was like, Oh, no, no, no, these are good. These are good vices. These are good vices. Love it. Love it.
And so next up, we've got our connection checks and this is the time when we check in with ourselves and our conductors for seeing how we kind of handled the last fortnight.
If you have a connection that you would like to share her with us and the rest of the amazing conductors, you can either tweet with the hashtag my conduit or in discord, which you can reach by becoming a member of relay.
You can go to the discord and in the show follow up channel, if you put the little conduit logo and do a question mark, my conduit, you can then let us know what your connection check is and what your future connection is.
And if you put it in there, it populates into the spreadsheet and then we can read it on the show. So do that, friends that are listening to us live right now.
But unfortunately, if you do it now, it will not be read until next week, unless discord goes down again halfway in the middle and then you have to do everything all over again. Right. Right. Because that's what happened last time.
And that's why we added a little sprinkling of the live chaos into the beginning of our last episode. So you can kind of understand what happens before and after the actual recorded show. And if you want to be a part of our live show, we highly recommend that obviously because we are hilarious.
And more importantly, our community is really fun. And the conversations that are had in the chat room during the live show is amazing. So you can be a member of the conduit community by going to relay.fm slash conduit and joining one of the members levels.
And that puts financial support in our pockets, which we greatly appreciate. Now that we've done all of that promo though, Jay, how do you do on your connection check? So I had to create a rule for myself that followed vice and point of order.
We actually had to change the acronym for vice only to help it make sense. So I'm going to re-through it again on from my blog because that was something that the tire slash vice advocate of the show, Chinthas, did not ask me to do. Oh, they're not in the, they're not listening live.
Oh, well, they'll hear it later. So yes. Wait, IVC wasn't working. Yes. So vice now stands for verbalize, identify consistency and evolve. And that's verbalize to others, identify the scope, consistency makes enforcement easier and just evolve.
And the reason we did that was because talking to some people, they said, well, don't these two mean the same thing. And then this other thing mean the same thing. And we just want to make it clear.
They're creating, it's almost as if creating strategies and acronyms live on a show does not provide the most comprehensive explanation. Exactly. And yet we're awesome and we pull it together and we can make it work.
So yes, definitely I was able to get a blog post out and in that I had to actually create a rule for myself. So my rule was don't officially say yes until you've committed at least 30 minutes to think about it.
Direct the request to schedule a meeting or send an email so you can review it at your leisure. Make sure you respond within two days of the written request, even if that means you're replying to say that you need to think more on it. Oh, love that. That's a really good one.
And I think I might need to do that. So what would you say? Did you complete your connection check? I'm guessing there's a big green check mark on that. I'm going to give that a big green compression clamp. Nice. Nice. I don't think that's an option, but I'm going to take it anyway. Is in our head.
It is in our mind. I also use the vice grip, but it was more for a specific time period, I think. So some of you may know in my real job, job life, I support a CPA client. And if you are in the US, it is currently tax season, which means life is bananas.
And last week, specifically, I had, I really clamped down on my boundaries to make sure that I could breathe and not let all of the to do lists in my list take over my entire life. And it's worked surprisingly well. I ended the week much less stressed than I started it.
No, not because there were fewer things to do, but because I had set those boundaries. And especially verbalize them to myself. So that I gave myself that permission to like, oh, no, I already said no to this thing at this point at this time. So there's no reason for me to say yes. Absolutely.
And I think that's the biggest. That was the thing that I struggled to convey in that post like enough of that vice isn't necessarily for you to tell people know all the time. It's to allow you to tell yourself, yes, to the things that you want to say yes to.
And I know that that's a lot like those if it's not a heck no, then or if it's not a heck yes, then it's a no and all that stuff. But it really does help when you can say, oh, no, my rule says that this is okay. And give yourself permission to do those things. Yeah.
Some sometimes saying it out loud can help a little bit as well. And so that's really it's a for me. But also if you've verbalized it to other people and this also this doesn't just have to be verbalizing to the other people that it impacts.
 But if you need some additional support from your community and friends and things that need some extra help by verbalizing where your boundaries are to other people, you can then have them help remind you if you are saying yes to too many things or making adjustments or doing things that you're not supposed to do.
So let's get on to our conductors connections. This is where over the past two weeks we have had our amazing conductors give us their connections, their connection check and see how they did in the last fortnight.
Except we're going to have a little bit of an extra little bonus here on the guitarist of the show Scott because discord was bad. And because it was down we've got some overlay.
So we're going to I'm going to do this duplicate connection and connection check in one thing because again the internet and technology is great. So Scott's connection for the last fortnight was to make steady progress with his help.
He's been focusing on diet and exercise in the last few weeks with the plan to start running again and now has a goal to focus on because his wife has signed up for a 5k and the fall and as a bonus he now gets trained with his favorite person. Okay, a stinking adorable. I love it.
And the connection check now is while his diet hasn't been perfect. It has been much better than the months past. The 5k training officially started and he feels good after day one. So the new connection is simply more of the same. Obviously we're going to put that down in the end of the show.
But for now feeling good after day one is great. I can't wait to see how you're doing in the future and how the 5k goes. That's super exciting to get to spend time with your wife as well. I love that.
And from our pathologist of the show we have, oh sorry, from our pathologist of the show Laura, we have their first connection. First connection. First connection. That's so exciting. I love it. It took Jay reading that for me to really like comprehend. I'm not sure yet. I'm not sure yet.
It kind of went off the rails there for a second but continue. Okay. So first connection I'm going to give this a try after listening since the first episode super fan. Love it. Love it. It took Jay reading that for me to really like comprehend that sentence.
We're so happy that you're here and you're doing a connect a can. The words. The words. We're so happy you're here and doing a connection. So excited. So their connection was I did the thing.
Time blocking was easy on the days that they had medium autonomy and it was super hard on most the empty days. Try the way it seems like they were also affected by the discord bugs.
So their original connection was to try time blocking a la the David Sparks method which if you haven't checked that out. I think there's some references to it on like focused and also max sparkies website and probably the other shows that he does. But we'll try and find a link to the blog post.
We'll make it happen. But every time they looked at the schedule, they were reminded of what they wanted to be working on and was able to get back on task. It really seemed to help with ADHD brain which often wonders off in needs redirection.
Also can we say underscore of the show? Oh, okay, nevermind. That's them just that's them. They want to be the pathologist of the show. They follow the rules and told us what of the show name they wanted right away and we really we love that. Our chat has broken us by not following the rules.
I don't know. So my father's the rules. We don't know how to respond. It's shocking and surprising and we love it. So thank you, Laura, for following the rules and also congratulations. You did the thing.
Time blocking was easy on the days where they had medium medium autonomy and super hard on the mostly empty days. I feel you. It seems to do best with some tent pole scattered throughout the day versus completely empty time. Oh boy, I feel that. I feel that's so much.
If I have a fully blank day because it happens so rarely, I never seem to be able to get my stuff together enough to actually do it. So well done, Laura. We're so excited to hear. All right. Chintas, connection check is a check mark and a smiley face.
So our entire advocate of the show says that at least for these two weeks, they've managed to successfully change their attitude to the task list. As a result, they're feeling calmer and their brain now thinks that they've achieved things despite still getting about the same amount done. Wow.
Okay, we've talked about this before. Brains are dumb. But well done on tricking your brain to let it feel that calmness over what you've actually been able to get done. Like that is incredible.
I think that is the hardest part of, and we'll talk about this later of doing a thing, but feeling as if you did a good job on the thing. So yeah, good job on the thing. Yeah.
Our blue dragon of the show, Skyler, said connection check, still not green, hearts, green break was a great chance to relax and stop worrying about classes. 10 out of 10 would recommend.
Again, I'm going to not pick on our blue dragon of the show because maybe they're colorblind, and I don't want to be ableist. So I'm just going to assume that they meant to do green hearts and say way to go. Man, I miss spring break.
And clearly it's two blue hearts, which make a green check mark, right? That's how that works. I don't know that math. I don't know either, but I am not a developer of a calculator app. So instead, we're going to move on to our Oracle of the show's connection check.
Sof said has a green apple, and they've got five chapters edited. They didn't get the eat lunch and get exercise goal 100 percent, but got close. So it's pretty happy. And they're going to be a little bit easier for next fortnight's connection.
What I love the most about this connection check is that you still gave yourself a green apple. Like, even though you said it yourself, you didn't eat lunch and exercise 100 percent, you still succeeded. You still check that off, and I'm so proud of you.
And I know that this next fortnight is going to be amazing as well. And then our slot of the show, Ankenu, gave us a red box, which I'm just going to say, oh no.
Closer as I came to reassessing, the journaling was gathering some ideas together to review later and setting up to track the connections, no real movement on the core idea. That's okay. I mean, that sounds like some progress.
I don't want to make you feel like you have to complete a thing to get a check mark. Right. I mean, let's make it a yellow box because you did make progress. It just maybe wasn't as much progress as you would hope for, but still progress. Yeah. I agree 100 percent. You are working on that.
So get that yellow. Yep. Yep. Yellow box. We've got the yellow box in the chat. So he's updated it. We're good to go. Well done. Sloth of the show. All right. Last connection check for the day is Ryan, who has a yellow circle.
The fancy music boy of the show has been focusing on their brain is going okay and things are slowly getting better, but it's still very much a work in progress. Ryan, fancy music boy of the show, that's how life is.
It's always going to be a work in progress and being able to recognize that and acknowledge the fact that it's not a failure is absolutely green check mark in our eyes. I'm going to speak for Jay right here. But keeping that progress means that you're successful and so well done. Absolutely.
And by the way, the reason we read these is for what is happening in our chat right now, everyone being super supportive of one another, everyone giving each other cheers, emojis, hearts, retweets. I feel you use all of the things. That's the focus of this. If you want to be a part of that, relay.

I spend a week in Austin for work and when you have to go to those fancy conferences, you have to make sure that you're safe. You also have to make sure that you keep a receipt for every scooter that you ride.
And because they shut off a bunch of roads, I had to write a lot of scooters and the only way that I was able to keep track of all of those different rides was by connecting DevonThink to my email.
I created a simple rule that just said, hey, if it came from one of the scooter companies, then make sure you go ahead and get that. And then from there, I was able to expense all of my scooter rides. I got to ride scooters for free. Y'all, they was fun. I would do it again.
And DevonThink made it even easier for me to get all of that stuff back into my system and reported back to my company. Well, thank goodness you didn't break your ankle like Rose did when we were on the scooter together.
So basically, I'm not allowed to ride a scooter with you because then you'll break your ankle. So, thank you. Fair enough. Thankfully, you didn't and you have all of those receipts all put together and you two can get 10% off, not you two.

So, we sneaked the title a little bit with what, where did that come from, Jay? Where did that came from? Oh, the devil spaghetti. Yeah. It came from the darkest depths of my brain, I guess. Which I love.
There was a tweet at some point where someone was like, two emojis that explain your situation or explain your career. And I was like, oh, I could do something like, um, imp and pasta for imposter syndrome. So yeah, devil spaghetti or imp pasta is something that we are going to talk about today.
Yeah. Um, it's, it's funny because I feel deeply that the imposter syndrome does connect with anxiety, but it also is fully separate. So I just, I'm newly in the realm of anxiety. I only started having it about, oh, my gosh, four years now. Well, I guess that's not recently anymore.
Um, wow, what is time? What is time? Uh, but that being said, um, I've always had imposter syndrome. And so it's been really interesting over the last couple years to kind of see how that my anxiety has affected imposter syndrome.
But more importantly, how I can work on getting better at combating it. Yeah, I've, I've was like flooded with, I guess an overwhelming amount of confidence growing up as a kid.
Um, there was a lot of familial expectation put on me to, you know, go to school and be a good student and do all these things.
And I think once I started struggling in schools, kind of like the first, uh, real point where imposter syndrome came in into, into factor and definitely after I dropped out of college, which, oh, yeah, stay in school, folks. It, it'd be hard out here sometimes.
But, you know, for me, it was every time I saw any level of success, I still had that all of those expectations that I hadn't met, uh, looming behind them to say, but you're really a fraud and you really can't do this because you couldn't even do the other things. Yeah, that's dangerous.
Um, brains and their bees are, are special. Um, and especially when it affects your work or your productivity is when it can be really, really dangerous.
Um, and it can also cause you to hold back for making choices because you're not going to be making choices because you don't think, um, you're good enough or whatever you're providing is not wanted. Um, Laura is confirming that pathologists all have imposter syndrome.
No, of course, we wouldn't want to say that they all have imposter syndrome, uh, but I could see it being very, very prevalent.
Um, I think, uh, a lot of times, uh, depending on how you were raised, um, and a lot, I know that a lot of times, um, females in my generation, uh, are still working through the barriers and ceilings that are in place.
And I would imagine it's prevalent on, um, different race and society factors as well. And, uh, the phrase walking into a meeting like you are a straight white man, um, and you own it is kind of something that helps me mentally pump it up because I'm like, oh, yeah, I got it.
They're, they're not going to see what a good imposter I am because I can make them all believe that I'm incredible. Yeah. And before we talk, you know, deeper and deeper into our own experiences, we, we want to, you know, definitely emphasize these are our experiences.
Um, neither one of us are doctors. Therefore, we're not going to be able to really help you with some of the things exactly that you're going through. We can't give you advice, um, that we would highly suggest you take.
I would, I would definitely say like, listen to our experiences if they sound like something that you're going through, maybe talk to a healthcare professional, especially a mental healthcare professional.
Um, and perhaps they can give you some like trained, licensed advice because no, you don't have to, you don't have to go to school at all to get a microphone and talk on the internet, which is why I love this career. It's great. And some, for some reason, people listen to us. So that's nice.
Except if you are thinking that we're actual doctors, we're not doctors. But I do think that we are qualified to do the things that we do and that I think that's where the first signs of imposter syndrome exist is you are doing the thing. You are in the space.
You are whatever it is that makes you feel like you're not supposed to be there. You are there. Like that is, that is such a thing that we overlook in this process of imposter syndrome has to come out of some form of success.
So in order to feel this, you have to have some success that came with it. So if anything, congratulate yourself. Congratulations yourself for at least getting to that point. Absolutely.
Because I think if I was to walk into, let's say, the Olympics gymnastics meet, no amount of imposter syndrome would like let me do any better. Because I can barely even do a cartwheel anymore. So I couldn't even pretend my way. And I'm also, you know, six foot.
There's not many gymnasts that are that tall. So that would be really difficult to do. However, I can really, apparently I have managed to, I mean, I know I'm an unicorn. I don't need, there's no imposter syndrome there. But what I have learned is that I am also a photographer that has gotten.
Okay. So let me take a step back. I recently had a photo shoot with our local dance team that was absolutely incredible. Some of the best photos that I've ever taken using chalk and throwing the chalk. And then they were dancing and all of that. And it was absolutely incredible.
And I was really proud of the work that I did. And I did some behind the scenes video so that I could put together a TikTok for it as well. That TikTok has almost 25,000 views. What? Yeah.
And not only that, but one of the local photography idols in the area, his daughter was at the same dance competition that we were at. And so we're mutuals on Facebook, but we haven't ever really talked. And after I finished photographing the dance, I went back up to my seat.
And as I'm walking up the stairs, he goes, Hey, Kathy. I was like, Oh, my gosh, she knew my name. Okay. Hi. And then he holds up his phone with my TikTok. And it's like, this is frickin' incredible. This is amazing. And then ask some questions about it.
This is someone who photographs the professional soccer, hockey, basketball, and LaCross teams in Portland. He is the one, I don't know if you saw the cheerleaders get the basketball off of the net from the seat double. Yeah.
He took the photo that is on the front page of all the newspapers like that. So he's like a big deal. And so to hear him say that to me, I just about passed out. And I'm like, Oh, good. I am faking my way.
We'll just ignore the fact that it took way too long to set up the lights and make sure that everything was working properly because that doesn't matter. Because I was able to fake it enough.
You know, even in the present, you know, in my career, like I look at people and often want to give them credit for what they're doing to help with, to help combat this idea of imposter syndrome. And it's always been this moment of like, I'm going to lift up the people around me. You're amazing.
You're amazing. And then when they reciprocate and they go, Oh, yeah, you're really great too. I love this thing. Just like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's not about me. Don't make it about me because the second it's about me.
It's like I can be doing the exact same thing that you're doing. And you be the professional, but the second you call me professional, you're a liar. Right. That's exactly in that moment.
And I mean, even thinking about, you know, just how amazing my co-host is, funny story, my spells came in one day laughing and just said, by the way, I started following this person on TikTok and it was so great. And I just happened to check it again. And then I saw that it was Kathy.
And I was like, Oh, yeah, you know Kathy. Y'all talk before. And she was just like, I didn't realize that Kathy was doing all of this amazing stuff. And in my head, it became like the people around you that are so amazing are usually around you for a reason.
But also like, I feel like the more and more that you see that and the more and more that you amplify them, the less you start to feel that you're qualified to be around them. Yeah.
I've found by identifying and calling out other people's awesomeness, it's been easier, still difficult, but it's been easier for me to be proud of things that I've done as well. There's a level of good comparison in place.
Now if you have people that you're constantly trying to one up, that's when it can be a little bit dangerous and not recommended. But if you have supportive, incredible humans in your life and dragons and unicorns and dogs and cats, I got to include everyone in our audience.
But if you have these amazing connection, can say it, say it, so I can ring the virtual bell. Yeah. Okay. Good. Anke do says that people includes more than humans. So I'm just going to call it people. This includes all of our animals and mythical beings.
You're all people just for the sake of this because I can't include everyone in this. So all of the incredible people in your life, if you keep them being incredible and if you keep pumping them up and let them pump you up, pump up the jam, pump it up. Oh no. No, I'm done. I'm sorry. I apologize.
But if you can allow them to congratulate you and help support you in the good and the bad places and then celebrate the heck out of you when you have some incredible things and let them remind you how awesome you are. Like I got to do on the phone call with Jay earlier this last week. Oh my gosh.
What is time? Was that just yesterday? I feel like it was a couple of days ago, but yeah, there's like so much happening that is challenging my imposter syndrome at the moment that I can't talk about yet, but I will. I promise. I know Jay likes to keep secrets, but they're always good secrets.
Usually they're worthwhile, but Kathy, I agree with you so much. And I think that that's the difference in many, in many different techniques of when I lift up other people, sometimes it reminds me of the things that I haven't done.
Whereas for you, Kathy, when you lift up others, it allows you to equate your successes to them. And I think that that often comes in wording. Like I often will word, a compliment.
They're in a way that is this person is great because they do this instead of perhaps this person is great because without them, we're able to make, we're not able to make certain things happen.
So it takes it from them being the complete package to a thing getting done to them being a part of it, which means you're the other part. Yeah. Yeah, I think it's important to be able to have a very specific compliment to somebody as well.
So transitioning from receiving, you know, compliments and support and turning it around and supporting others and how to especially if there's somebody that maybe doesn't take compliments very well.
And you know this about them, but you still want to try and make sure that they realize that they are loved and appreciated. Being able to have a very specific incident of what you're complimenting them for and why you're making that connection with them as a human.
I try to do this a lot whenever I'm out in the world, which is not very often anymore, of course, but when I am, if I recognize and am like, oh my gosh, that person's earrings are incredible.
I'll tell them from a safe distance, obviously, and just acknowledge and just say, hey, I wanted to let you know, I absolutely adore your earrings. And then they'll usually have a shocked look on their face for a moment and say, thank you and continue on.
But I'm hoping that that comment maybe left a little warm place in their heart. And when they wear the earrings again, they can maybe think of that how much some random person at the grocery store said. So it doesn't have to be these great big, yay, congratulations on getting a job. Yay, you did.
You made a baby. Hurray, you're doing a podcast.
 But looking at these micro supports can be really helpful because it will also come back to you in a way that like, I don't really fully believe in karma as a like be all and all, but it makes it easier for you to recognize little good bits that are coming back to you if you're sending them out into the world.
Yeah. And I want to take a moment actually to talk about how some of the things that we've talked about in the past can really play to this. And I think the biggest one obviously is vice. Again, set rules for yourself. Set rules for other people.
I'm going to highlight a rule that I heard recently on a favorite show of mine called Finding Your Dragon. I'm sure you've heard of it. FMD or FMD? Yeah, by my dragon. It's called Find My Dragon. No, no, it's finding your dragon.
No, it's finding your dragon, Tati, because I know where my dragon is. But anyway, I always call it FMD and I always put it in my easy playlist and overcast. And that is a deep cut. So if you know what I'm talking about in there, you're definitely a member.
Anyway, in FMD in the latest episode, there was a conversation about one being very, very apparent when people that aren't in your collective start to notice that you're doing things. And what you can do to celebrate those small wins.
And I think that, you know, just like micro supporting other people, I think if you give yourself those little micro victories, those small wins. And again, that's why I say you have to vice that.
You have to celebrate the wins even when they're small because by doing that, it allows you to start to normalize those patterns as they're happening. And it just puts you in an overall celebratory space, which helps fight with things like anxiety.
And anything that is going to give you a negative space, vice that stuff out of your life.
One of the things that the hosts were talking about was that only one of them has access to analytics because the other person doesn't really, they feel like if they obsess about the analytics, it becomes a negative instead of a positive.
So instead of stressing about the numbers, instead they celebrate the individual micro accomplishments. And I love shout out to Sof and our chat for calling it a micro victory. Not to be confused with the micro brewery. Those are different. But both are very good.
But yeah, I think if we can start to create rules around, hey, is this thing celebratory or is it done in like a manner of negativity? And we have to start eliminating those negative factors and focusing only on those things that allow us to feel as if we are where we need to be. Yeah.
And I think once you also have started reaching out and celebrating those micro victories with others, you can help other people that are trying to celebrate it. Get this radical joy and victories in these micro victories and be able to celebrate.
When I was in London, when I was in London, a red carpet from New York. I can't believe it. No, I should be proud of this. I should be proud of the fact that I got to. I was invited to go to London for a red carpet premiere for a television show. Like I am owning that.
However, when I was there, I found myself multiple times talking to another content creator who he's been in the space for a while. And he is a YouTube creator and a couple times we'll talk about how he doesn't know how to take it when people compliment him.
And I was just like, well, thank you for listening. Thank you for being a fan. Thank you. You know, just say thank you. You don't have to follow it up.
Being able to just say thank you and acknowledge the bravery of somebody to come up and talk to someone that they have a parasocial relationship with. Being able to acknowledge the compliment. Even if you don't believe it, even if you want to follow it up with, oh, my best.
This isn't my best work or I could do better or, you know, oh, yeah, I made a mistake here.
Or any of that being able to acknowledge that somebody wanted to tell you a good thing and accepting it, saying thank you and allowing it to move on can be helpful when it comes to like working through somebody forcing a compliment on you. Yeah.
And, and Kathy, I just have to tell you that one, you are so amazing at the things that you do. And I mean, honestly, this show as a whole is successful because you're on it. Me not so much, but no, not allowed because clearly this show happens because you're on it.
This show goes off the rails because I'm on it. I would much rather be on this show off the rails with you than on the rails with someone else. Yeah. And I say that to mean that the, it's the connections that you make in your career, in your trade or whatever it is that you're doing.
Leave them when they, when they give you your, your kudos, believe it because trust me. If I've worked with people that I felt like their imposter syndrome wasn't actually a syndrome, they might have been playing the game.
But at the same time, it's, it's those moments when you do work with people that you, you start to question how much, how much are you pulling in the load there? And if, if they're giving you your compliments, trust me.
They're probably very, very worth it because most people aren't going to waste time giving people that aren't worth it, empty compliments. Yeah. And, and here's the thing too, is that even if it is an empty compliment, take it, own it. Like that.
Like, obviously someone's not going to come up to me and say, you know, wow, the music that you played this weekend was incredible because a, I don't play music and b, if I did, it was not, it would not be incredible. And so if it feels like an empty compliment, it's still compliment.
What is that? They say no press is bad press. No compliment is a bad compliment. Obviously taking out, you know, the backhanded compliments or the like really underhanded, whatever. Oh, you were so much better than you were last week. Like, yeah.
But I think any, any compliment, you should own that and help work through your imposta syndrome. Yeah.
And, and you know, at the end of the day, like, if, if someone compliments you, you're at least whatever that thing that they're complimenting you on, you're at least that to them, you know, and sometimes that's enough.
And at the end of the day, like, they're, you don't know what they're going through. Maybe they want to be where you are right there. And if you're playing it off as it's like, not this big deal, congratulations, you've, you've just kind of stepped all over their dreams. So, yeah, yeah.
Don't, basically, you're calling them a liar. Yeah. So, don't be rude and just take the compliment. Yeah. And, and if you don't know what to say, just say thank you. Yeah. So thank you, Tony. Um. Yes.
Uh, thank you, Jay, for, for being amazing and incredible and, uh, willing to be vulnerable and tell me all the hot goss, uh, that you have going on in your life because it makes me feel happy.
Oh, man, there's, there's been a lot of feeding into my, um, my devil spaghetti that just really makes me, uh, need this episode. Right as we're having it. And the best part about it is I didn't even have to suggest it. It came from you. It was all me. It was all you. It's such a great co-host.
Oh, no, you are. Okay. I'm going to take the compliment. Nice. Nice. All right. It's time for our connections for the next fortnight. Jay, what is yours? I'm going to, I'm going to take a lesson and no, no, stop it. I see what you're talking about.
Why do you do this? Why do you do this to me? Why do you do this to me? Oh, for the people not noticing. Okay. So Kathy and I share a note and I'll share a Google doc. And as I was about to say, I'm going to do my best to compliment somebody. Kathy's typing in compliment somebody.
I was like, ah, okay. I am going to work on accepting compliments. Oh, there you go. Um, and I'm not sure how to do that. I'm just going to do the exact same voice as if someone was reading a sponsor ad and go, thanks. And then they'll think I'm weird and then run away. I guess I don't know.
No, hey, no, no. No. Besides, there's nothing wrong with being weird. I'm going to say, what's your name? I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure.
There's nothing wrong with being weird. I wonder what Cathy's going to do. So I'm going to compliment one person each day, whether online or in real life. And I'm going to work on not just having it be a generic compliment to check it off.
but I'm going to work on really concentrating on finding a moment, a thing to interact with them for.
Specifically, I think like a podcast that I listened to or a video that I watch on YouTube or whatever, giving them that joyful little bit of happiness, not asking something from them, not needing anything just being able to sprinkle some good cheer. Yeah. Yeah.
Well, with that, shall we check in with our conductors for their connections for the next fortnight? Yeah, we're at an hour, so we need to be like professional and stuff and run through. No, it's okay. No, we can meander however long we want. This podcast has chapter markers.
If somebody doesn't want to listen, they can just keep skipping because we're going to continue connecting with our conductors. Oh, one thing before you do that, you mentioned complimenting podcasters and things like that.
You know a good way to do that is to give them a five-star rating on whatever podcast player you're listening to. Like for real, whenever you get those, they mean the world to whoever sees them.
So I, as someone who doesn't get them all the time, like when I see them, I'm just like, oh, wow, someone really likes my show. I'm doing a great job. I need to keep doing it. So yeah, if someone is doing something that you really enjoy, make sure you let them know.
And if they are a podcaster, do it in a way that helps benefit what they're doing. Absolutely. And our chat says also if they're a YouTuber, make sure you hit that button ring that bell, do all those things too. Yes, absolutely. All right, so let's check in with our conductors.
Our guitarist of the show, Scott, their connection for the next fortnight is to make steady progress with their health. Oh, wait, no, I'm taking that back because we already read that because that was I didn't delete that. We already did that one too. It's fine. This is great. All right, she's us.
Their connection for the next fortnight is to community. Communities in the NNK community. You're so good at this. I am doing great. I am amazing. You are amazing. Thank you.
All right, Chintas' connection for the next fortnight is to communicate and keep to the messaging rules that they've set for themselves using the vice method. Great emoji use there. And that is to not answer non-emergencies when outside of work time or when in a meeting with someone else.
Keep those boundaries up. Absolutely. And then our out of the show Kate says next connection in the next two and a half weeks they have two deadlines.
Their aim is to get as much of the building designed before the end of the month for the first deadline as it's the last official chance for feedback before the final deadline.
I mean, again, I just want to point out that we have so many amazing folks in our channel that we have people building things and writing things and doing all these things at deadlines have to just, ah, I don't know. Again, they're all amazing.
So I'm just going to keep saying that and leave that there. So yeah, you can do it, Kate. I believe. Yes, you can do it. All right, Skyler's connection is to roll more dice with a winky face.
Now, I don't know what this blue dragon of the show is planning to do with those dice, but I am down for it. Whatever. Maybe one day they'll roll a green heart instead of a blue one. I'm making this a good thing. The green dragon of the show. I'm waiting one day. Wow.
Get ready to have a dragon after you. Holy cow. Well, then our Oracle of the show. So they say that their next connection is to meditate five times a week, exercise three times a week, and sit in the garden on a nice spring day. Oh, wow. That's, that's a lot.
And I hope that you've worked up to this point to do it because I tried to do that. And I did not, but I know that I also tried to write a book. And you're doing that. So you have the ability to do that. You have the ability to do this. I believe in you. You can do it. You can do it. Yay.
We got confirmation that they've been ramping up. So you absolutely can do it. This is the moment you can do it. Got it. All right. Our sloth of the show for the next fortnight. Ankenu is going to revisit the journaling again and try to get some traction this time.
I only want you to try and get traction if you will also forgive yourself if you don't get it. So revisiting it. Great. Perfect. Recognizing and acknowledging where you were in the past and where you are now. Absolutely incredible. Just make sure you're gentle with yourself. And you can do it.
There was a tire metaphor there that we'll talk about after the show. Anyway. And last but not certainly not least, the dungeon master of the show Rob says new connection. Two weeks until the new job starts. Yeah. Yeah. Gotta wrap up everything of the current job.
Sort of how to return an in person job. Bags close and everything and make sure that they have the systems to ensure that their wife isn't left with the household labor while they're away more.
That's where so we are hoping to talk about like what happens in those changes and like adapting systems and doing all that stuff soon. So Rob, thank you so much for sharing that with us. I know that you can't do it and I'm looking forward to it.
Hearing or I guess I look forward to hearing about it more in the next connection check. Absolutely. All right. And with that, that is all our connections for this episode.
Once again, if you would like to leave a connection check or a future connection, you can always tweet with the hashtag my conduit or our preference is to hang out in the relay discord and you can go into the show follow up channel and leave your connection there.
Just put the the conduit logo and a question mark my conduit and it will get loaded into our magical spreadsheet. This episode of conduit was brought to us to you. One more time. You're doing it. You're doing it. Thank you, Devon. Thank for sponsoring this episode of conduit.
Jay, did we conduit? I mean, you did. I'm not worth it. No, I'm just kidding. Yeah, we totally conduit it. Heck yeah, we did. Took a couple tries at the end, but we finally conduit it.
