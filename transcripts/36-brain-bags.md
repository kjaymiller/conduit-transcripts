From RelayFo, you're listening to Conduit, the show we Condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show about code, and careers, and YouTube, and passions, and things, and other things. This episode is brought to you by Masterclass.
I'm Jay, and Kathy is away, being awesome, having fun, doing all that stuff, so decided to give her a little break, and I brought in a new friend of mine, as I told the live chat listening with us.
Someone that I got to meet over really great drinks and food, and community and friends, the wonderful PK shoe. PK, how's it going? I'm doing fine. It's great to co-host us with you. This is really nice, and hopefully we have a great conversation.
Yeah, it's one of those things where when you get to meet someone new for the first time, and first of all, you find out that they're into the same things that you're into, YouTube and productivity, and things like that.
And then also the fact that one of the things that you do is review bags and things like that, and that was something that I was actively trying to get solved for myself.
I couldn't think of any other way to repay you than being like, hey, why don't you just come on the show and let some people learn more about what you do, and kind of take a little bit of insight from you. But before we do that, let's jump into our shout outs.
We have an actual shout out from the community. So shout out from Catherine. And it says, I was a bit behind on conduit listing, but just caught up on episode 34 with James and Kathy.
Having gone through a similar situation to James over the past 12 months, I just wanted to say that both James and Kathy spoke incredibly thoughtfully and openly. I recognize myself in a lot of what James articulated. Thank you both. I hadn't planned on being a blubbering mess this evening yet.
Here I am. Catherine, thank you so much. That's... I was actually meeting PK when this was happening. So I'm glad that my absence was able to make way for kind of a really heartfelt and deep kind of moment on the show.
And that's something that Kathy and I talked about a lot when we started the show, when we were talking about starting the show, was we wanted to have opportunities to share ourselves, share our lives, to some healthy extent.
And to also give people a sense of openness about trying to be productive, trying to accomplish the things that we want to accomplish, but also kind of the weird foibles that kind of get in the way of those things. So yeah, thank you for that.
And then I have a personal shout out to the Rebsis team. Rebsis is a company that does web development and a lot of their employees are friend of ours.
And they were the ones that actually invited us to this dinner where I sat next to PK and we got to talk and found out that he was into podcasting and YouTube and all these other things. So a shout out to them and PK, I think you had a shout out as well, right? Yeah, just adding to references.
I mean, yeah, I know those guys were a long time and they really are really cool people. And the conference that you and I did that Jay Key noted, right? The Django Khan, that whole community, it's a wonderful community and Rebsis is part of it.
But I want to give a kind of a strange shout out to a ultra-local news organization that I am on the advisory board for. So we're on the internet.
But these days, I think getting good news is hard and I think there are a lot of people around the country for sure that are starting this grass roots ultra-local news. So I live in the tank on Lexington.
This new service is called Lex Observer and it's very, very small, right? We constantly need people to help out, do the work and fundraise and we funded a full-time report and she's amazing. So that maybe is a model to get news to people about things that matter. So Lex Observer is the thing.
We'll get up even though you don't live in my area. Yeah. So we were talking about this before, kind of that idea of like we often think about things on such a global scale or a national scale. I know like election week was last week and everybody was super excited about all these things.
And in my head, it was like, you know, we often don't think about those small local events. Yeah, like to abstract, right? The global stuff is important but then this is too far away. Yeah.
So I definitely wanted, I love that you threw in kind of like a really a small kind of idea of like, oh, hey, I want to support this little thing. And I mean to me, that is, that's super amazing. All right, PK, we've done a lot of stalling. I think it's, oh, actually before that.
I completely forgot. We have a thing. One, these shout outs that we read, we get shout outs from people all the time doing amazing things within the relay of him community. If you want to join them, you can totally do so by going to relay.
fm slash conduit and becoming a member that helps Kathy and myself. And it helps us also to like, hunt and find people like PK to fill in when we can. But also, this is a great time to do it because at the time that this episode goes out, we will be a few days away from our annual holiday special.
So we have to kind of tell you a few days in advance because we only record every other week. So starting next week, next Monday for the next three, four weeks until December 17th, annual plans will be 20% off. Before the first year, after the year, it goes up to the full price.
Last year was great. We got some new members out of that. This is also a great way if you know, if someone in your life, someone special in your life loves listening to podcasts, they love listening to relay.
fm switch on, then you can give them an annual membership and they can join the discord and they can, you know, have as much fun as we get to have and break room and in systems and themes and all these other places. So if you want to learn more about that, you can go to give relay.
com, scroll down to the bottom, find the conduit logo and hit OK. We don't have any special perks other than our live recordings where we hang out with our chat. But I've been told that there are conversations afoot to maybe add something special in the future, but no promises.
But again, that's give relay.com to become a member and join the relay.fm family and get to hang out with us when we record every other Tuesday. That said, PK, are you ready for the connection checks? SAB. Yes, I am. That was the most chill zap ever and I loved it.
So my connection was to wrap up some of the things that prevented my DFN DFG, which we have a systems check coming in. I think the next episode, I will probably talk about those a little bit more on that episode. But DFN is done for now. DFG is done for good.
I was able to wrap up a couple of projects and I do hope that that is going to kind of put a button on those things, but I did actively work on it. I did actively clear off a couple of things. So yeah, I'm going to say I got a green check on these.
And well, PK didn't have a connection check for this week. Kathy did give us one. Said connection check, yellow heart. I didn't put up the lights like I wanted to, but I have added a unicorn blanket to my work chair. Oh, absolutely.
Last episode was all about doing just some of the silliest of things and I do think that adding a unicorn blanket totally counts. And I'm going to definitely agree with you that that's definitely a green check mark there.
But she also started doing some silly dancing while warming up and waiting for coffee to finish. And she's looking forward to more silly things. I love it. PK, do you do any silly things? Just because I'm not sure. It's not bad. I listened to that episode.
That was the funniest conversation near the end. You guys just go all the way down to the silly city in this row. I'm not sure who's silly, but I think I'd like to pick a lot of jokes with family, friends, co-worker because it's always, you need to laugh.
Otherwise, how are we going to get through the day? Yeah, I think in general, just having something that lightens the mood especially. And I love that you didn't mention things necessarily that are for you.
You did things that are for other folks, which to me is way more important because now you're not just helping yourself. You're kind of spreading that love to your teammates as well. Yeah, and I think, you know, we help each other, right? Like we joke around a lot and then just make things easier.
Yeah. Speaking of others, we have some of our conductors connections. Our guitarist of the show, Scott, says, I usually go for the tri-blend shirts, a cotton bureau, but that purple cotton goes so well with the conduit logo. My bad, that was not a connection.
That was just a reminder that we have shirts on sale. You can actually get a conduit shirt, either the conduit logo or you can get the IMA conductor shirt, which I really, really like. You can go to you, con, wear it, that's you, seal in, wear it, calm for that.
Let's try an actual connection check this time around. Our soprano of the show, Deborah says, connection check, green check mark, I am taking care of myself and resting after surgery. Wonderful friends have made sure that we are fed and there's no pressure to come back to work before I'm ready.
Deborah, that's awesome. I'm glad that you are able to take lots of rest. PK, what about Kate? So Kate, I'll of the show says, when writing my last connection, I somehow forgot the most important things happening this fortnight.
So I did continue the job search and sorting, but also last Wednesday was her master's graduations, congrats. You can see pictures in the brickroom. Massive graduation, that is something, right? Yeah, congratulations.
Are you now the master of the show? The name list of the show robbers says connection check, a red pin, connection was not done, went to Disneyland instead. My wife had a surprise trip plan for my birthday, so connections were pushed back. I think that's okay.
I hope you had a wonderful time at Disneyland and I wish I would have known because I live like so close to Disneyland, but I'm glad that instead you were able to have a great time with your wife. I'm sure that's actually a little bit more important.
Yeah, what about what about so? So, Oracle off the show says connection check, the writing projects are going okay. So okay is good. I finished the guest block and book chapter. Wow. But I haven't got far with my academic writing yet. I also estimated what I could get done in two weeks.
I totally agree with that. I hope that has made a lot of time. So that sounds like a great accomplishment there. That's my resting state is overestimating. That's right. I was just taking to do this, Jay. I don't know. We'll see.
And then our blue dragon of the show, Sky says, blue heart, I extroverted a whole lot while at my first conference. And it was a lot of fun. Excited to do more of these in the future. Yeah. I mean, I know PK and I are kind of biased, but I personally love going to come up with conferences.
And the thing is once you start going to them all the time, that's like the place where you get to see all your friends again. So it's like the extended family, right? It's just good to catch up periodically. Absolutely. And let's catch up with our sponsors.

Now, if you've been following along on my personal business journey, you'll know that I am expanding my unicorn business into more of a full agency. The scary part for me is turning into more of a CEO and a leader that's leading more than just my clients.
Now that I have several unicorns that work with me, I need to step up. When I saw Indra Nui's class leading with purpose, I immediately knew what was next on my list to what. Indra was the CEO of PepsiCo where she grew the net revenue more than 80%.
And also was the first woman of color and first immigrant to lead a Fortune 50 company.

com slash conduit right now. That's masterclass.com slash conduit. Our thanks to masterclass for their support of this show and all of Relay FM. So yeah, PK, I wanted to take this time and learn more about you because again, we met each other over dinner. People were talking.
There were a bunch of conversations and I don't remember what happened, but I think like something was on my phone and you were like, oh, you listen to podcasts. I love podcasts.
And I don't know if we were talking about Relay FM and I did my obligatory thing where I ask if you know about ATP and then I immediately message KC list is like some weird flex. And I'm and by the way, he said hi. Oh, good. So.
But yeah, I wanted to learn a little bit more about, you know, about you and what you do. So let first let's tell everybody a little bit more about some of the stuff that you do professionally and then like on the side and for fun. Yeah. So it was funny for my day job, I guess we would call it.
I can say, oh, I work in software. But then people start asking all sorts of questions. I think what I do is I'm kind of a technology change maker. I tend to, you know, get into a company for a few years and that's because they wanted to make some change.
So what I do is hire, find, find really, really good people hire them and then just help them build the next product that this company wants to do. And I find that very, very rewarding. And now I work with a company called E-Money Advisor and we just recently built a financial wellness application.
I think financial wellness, right together with mental wellness and physical wellness are really important. And I think people tend to ignore some of this stuff. So that's kind of my day job, not that exciting, I think, but it pays the bills.
I mean, I think that there's something about doing a job that you feel like makes a difference in people's lives. And I mean, financial wellness is one of those things that I know I absolutely wish I had earlier in my life. I would have made things a lot easier for me.
So I mean, even if the part that you do isn't, I mean, I think it's fine. I think it sounds fun.
If, I mean, even if it's not like, oh, I'm the CTO of this big thing, like it's still, you still know like the work that you're contributing to helps make a difference in people's lives, which is kind of cool. Totally.
When you get a note from the user, if they like what you do, that's very rewarding. So what about the outside of work? Yeah. So this whole YouTube thing. So because we, you know, I know I'm going on a show and I was trying to remember how this came about. And I'm honestly not so sure.
I went back to my channel and I started posting videos back in, I think, 2017, which is, oh, my gosh, a long time. Right? Because I'm one of those people who love gadgets, right? I guess kind of an early adopter.
And along the line, I said, hey, I'm going to make a video about this thing and post it on YouTube, but, you know, probably one subscriber is something. That's how it got started. And then because I used to travel a lot, I got into bags, which sounds kind of strange.
And I started posting some videos on bags and I read a lot of reviews. And eventually there's this site called the perfect pack that they were looking for additional writers. So I applied and I got in. And next thing you know, I'm doing, you know, back reviews on my own channel.
I'm writing for the perfect bag and the rest is kind of history. Yeah. So we were, I can't remember what we were talking about, but there was somehow we got on the conversation of like, I, I was carrying this like, little, great backpack. And you were asking me about it.
Yeah, it's like little sad backpack thing. And I was like, oh, man, I really need to get a new bag. And you were like, oh, I review bags. And I was like, that's right. What? Like, hey, Jay, look, check out this video.
And I looked up the one bag that I think would fit him and I text him the, the, the, the link to the review right away. So the strange, strangers, I would say first 10 minutes on beating somebody new, right? Yeah.
And the thing I liked about this was that it was one of those things that, you know, we had, we had Brad on the show, you know, the, we call him, Pind Daddy Brad because he's like the pin boss and, you know, it's, he, he has built this entire ecosystem around a very niche space.
And one of the things that I love about what you're doing is, you do bags and you do tech, but you, you don't do the things that everyone else covers. You're not, you're not covering, you know, you're not doing an iPhone or an iPad review and things like that.
But the stuff that you're doing is so important because it's often the thing that I go to right after I've made that big purchase. I just, you know, if I buy a camera, I want to find a bag for that camera. I want to find, you know, a good microphone for that camera.
So to be able to say, you know, there, there are all these channels that fight for everyone's attention in like, oh, this is the big iOS, whatever, whatever review and, you know, all of that.
I think you, you've found this like perfect area of, okay, yeah, now you've made that decision to buy this thing. How are you going to protect it? How are you going to get the most out of it? Yeah. Yeah.
I think, I mean, I think that's the, the great thing about kind of the long sale of the internet, right? But what I would say is that you have to be authentic about it. I am really into bags. You ask my family, they love me all the time. So I'm just sharing what I know.
So within this international community of, I would say no more than like maybe 20, 30, thousand people, you know, we exchange a lot of ideas.
Now outside of that world, nobody wants to know about this, you know, next new bag that I have, but within a community, I think it's certainly fun and it's great to share the knowledge. And I, I learned a lot about other reviewers and other users as well.
I often get messages now, right, from people say, hey, you know, have you, can you review this back? I've never heard of it. Let's talk about it. So I learned about product as well through the community. So I want to, I want to get your opinion.
Since we have a professional in a space that we, we don't often get a lot of access to.
And your opinion, what's the most important thing when it comes to choosing a bag? Ah, I think that most important thing is understand your use case because, right, a lot of people ask me, hey, what's the best backpack? I cannot answer that because everybody uses their bags differently.
So it is a matter of figure out what are you really using it for versus what you think you're using it for, like many things in life. And then if you know the use case, people like us, I think we can match you with a particular, at least a couple of bags and we can fit that and then go from there.
You know, are you a, you know, biking to the office kind of guy? You know, are you a, bring stuff to work by I really want to go hiking on the weekend kind of guys. So I think the use case matters a lot. That's interesting because I, I tend to want to like, I have several bags.
I have a bag that I carry like every day. I'm just kind of a little satchel now. And then I have my new bag, which I was actually about to go out and buy the bag, one of the bags that you, you reviewed. And then like I literally got home and my wife was like, there's this package from work.
And I was like, Oh, what's this? And it was a backpack and I was like, Oh, well, this is nice. I'll just use this for a while. But then I also have several little like cable organizer bags.
And I, I do think that that is one of the things that I, I tend to forget about when I'm like, Oh, I need a backpack. And it's like, okay, if I get a backpack, it doesn't need to hold all of my cables.
I don't need a special cable pouch for it because I already have one of those or I don't need a special camera section because I have a bag for my camera. Like I have all of these things that already exist that I can connect with.
And when we were talking, you know, one of the big things that I said that I needed was, I needed a, I needed a pack that would allow me to be modular because I have the components already.
I just need to have something that can either fit them or something that can attach them to kind of make my life easier. Yeah.
So, I mean, you know, maybe it's an engineering mind going on there, right? You work out your own modular systems and then you're just looking for ways to fit them together. But there are, so I think that fundamentally there are two kinds of back people.
There are the, what we call the pouch people, which you would find that you have items that are organized into their own containers and then you need a larger container for them. And then there are people who just like to put orders up in the bag.
So they like a bag that is like, you know, one giant bucket and just throw everything in it. Or they like to have a lot of components in that bag and they would divide the stuff into it. So I think it depends on how you use it again. It is no right way the wrong way. And I am also a pouch people.
So like I'm looking at my, so I, you know this, I am, I travel, I travel to work. To, to meeting today. So I have my entire, the back collection here for the trip and I basically have pouches sitting on the desk right now and the pouches would go back into the bag and I have back to the hotel.
So I'm also a pouch person. I feel like now I have to say hi, I'm Jay and I'm a pouch person. That's right. I think that's the t-shirt. I've been pouching since the days of the packing cube. I'm right. Since then now. People are really important to get me started.
So I wanted to ask how does the, like you two, you know, you get a bag and now you like in your mind, you're already thinking about the video.
You're already planning like the content around it or you get a piece of tech and you're already thinking about the content and how has that effect you in like your day job? Do you now do work where you're like, oh, this gives me an opportunity.
If I go travel here, this gives me an opportunity to try out this other bag that maybe I haven't tried before. So total. That took that two parts to it. The last part is excellent when you said.
So every time I go on the trip, I spend, you know, 30 minutes worrying about which back should I take to test this time, which is fun, right? I'm joking. That's a fun as part. So like today I took a new back that I'm not used to travel before because I wanted to test it out.
And that's because I have another trip coming up later. So this literature is a test run for this bag for the next trip. So that's how I have fun traveling. The other thing about work is I, maybe you can tell when we met, I am actually a typical introverted nerd. I don't like to talk.
I certainly don't like to give presentation. I like to send it back. So, you know, at what I do these days, I mean, I, you know, I do a lot of speaking within a company and sometimes in public.
And doing all those YouTube videos really helped me in just learning to speak and not be afraid of right speaking, even though in YouTube, you're just, you're recording it, but still people see that afterwards.
So it helps my writing and presentation skill a lot and that benefits my professional life, which something that I didn't think of until, you know, much much later as I went down this journey. That's one of the interesting things about, you know, just doing content in general.
And I mean, I would, I would encourage people podcasting has become cheaper than it has ever been. So like at this point, like if you, I mean, so is YouTube, like most of the, most of the people listening to this have, you know, a 4K camera in their pocket and that's right. Use your phone.
I use that phone most of my short, maybe using states, it just, it works. Yeah. If you have ever thought about like what are the benefits of doing this? I mean, one of the benefits might just be it'll improve communication skills in general.
The other side of that is, is definitely this feeling of, I don't want to say like being on and being off, but kind of like as you mentioned, you know, you tend to be a little bit more introverted.
And when people meet me outside of like doing my job, like when I do my job, but it's, I don't want to say charisma, but it's like, you know, I'm on. I have this smile. I'm shaking hands. I'm talking to people. I'm, you know, I'm engaging.
But then afterwards, it's like once I can get away from that, I feel completely different. And maybe how I am on, you know, behind a booth or on stage is different from how I am in a live stream.
And this actually happened to me this morning where someone messaged me in a live stream and they were like, Jay, are you usually this chill? And I was like, it kind of just depends on where you find me. Like on, on stage, not really, because I'm more emotional and more expressive.
And when I'm, you know, behind a can't where I'm, you know, behind a microphone for a podcast, you know, I, I used to tell people I, I feel like a professional wrestler at times in that I know that part of my job is to play the part, but still be my authentic self.
So I can, I can get on a recording and say, okay, podcast or Jay comes to the mic now. And you know, I do the podcasting thing.
And then like, once that's over, I go to my room and play Tetris and decompress and I think like my daughter and I last night were playing basketball on her little bitty, like basketball hoop in her room.
And I started playing space jam and we were like jumping up and down and having a good time and doing a dance party. And I'm like, I think if people from a conference saw me doing all, they're like, whoa, never seen Jay that. Like expressive. You know, but that's right. That's right.
So yeah, just being able to, to have like that outlet to be able to be like, okay, I get on a YouTube channel and I can do these things. You not only learn these abilities, but you also gain the ability to then do something a little different.
And it allows you to kind of get into new positions that maybe you're not completely familiar with and go, oh, what does this need?
 Let me bring that to the table and then you can bring that and people will be like, oh, wow, you should totally get Jay or you should totally get PK because, you know, they might seem a little, you know, introverted when you talk to him one on one or when you see them in a room, but trust me, when they get on stage, they've got it.
They're totally prepared for this. Yeah. And it also, it brings the creativity out of us, right? I think everybody has a creative part in them. And I think I said sometimes that doesn't get excised a lot.
So podcasting, reviewing, writing, all this fun stuff, I think help us exercise the creativity side of ourselves. So we've talked about a little bit of like the creativity side. We talked about some of the other stuff. I wanted to kind of wrap all of this into the productivity of it all.
 I know that when we first met, you listened to ATP and that you mentioned some of the other like podcasts on Relay FM switch on that you listen to, how important to you is thinking about your productivity when it comes to not only just creating the content, but kind of keeping it separated, I guess.
I wouldn't say it's really important. I wouldn't say it's separated, but keeping it organized integrated. Right. So just like you, we played multiple roles, right? There's work stuff, there's families stuff. There is, you know, the YouTube stuff, the creative stuff.
How can I keep track of all of it so that it doesn't kind of stress me out? It's important. So I, you know, I, we talk about it. I use a whole bunch of different tools and I certainly have a kind of a reviewer calendar, a content calendar, but you know, that is mixing with my work stuff.
I just need to get all of it down onto a system so that I don't feel stressed out about it. Interesting.
It's, so I struggle with this because, you know, I have found, again, I don't want to spoil next week's or the next episode, but I, I found a new way to, I guess classify the type of productivity. Oh, not like that. I know, right? Hey, come on.
But the, the interesting concept of it is, is allowing for that separation, but having that separation kind of be together, which is interesting, you know, it's separated but together.
 And I, I think about that too, because, you know, we were talking about this a little bit right before the show of, you know, when, when I'm doing work, because my job is to do this, like my job is to get on a microphone and talk or to get behind a camera and talk or to get on stage and talk or, you know, write code so that I can go talk about it later, or to write blog posts and things like that.
And what that's caused me to do is as I'm working or trying to learn about a thing, I'm already at the content stage. And the sad thing about that is, I think that that affects me in a negative way.
In some cases, because I'm not able to, I'm not able to just learn because I'm always trying to learn with this other angle attached to it.
Like, how can I, how can I best teach this? Let me, let me avoid the boring stuff that might be really important to learn because it's not really something that goes well on screen. I actually had this problem yesterday where I was at a meetup and I was speaking.
And in the presentation, what I realized was there were so many difficult concepts that it made the overall presentation hard to follow.
Whereas, sure, I could have taken some of those concepts out or I could have just started with the concept and said, if you want to learn more about how I use these things, this becomes a whole other area.
But what I had done was I basically said, let me just gloss over all the difficult things and then bring everything in together and give you this, this presentation salad of different concepts all mixed together. And by the end, I could see the confused looks on people's faces.
So you were realizing this while you were giving the presentation? Yeah, because you're always looking for these cues where you're just like, okay, hey, oh, oh, people, people are, they're kind of following their, oh, I think I lost somebody. I think I lost a few more people.
And they're like, you know, when you start doing that, it's, again, it, the challenge there was, it was how I learned it. You know, I learned it because it was like, okay, I just want to get to the, the meat and potatoes of this so that I can show it to other people.
But it, it meant that I didn't spend enough time and it affected the, the way I presented it as well in a negative way. See, so I, it's funny, but I, I listened to what you're saying. And I thought that was something really positive.
Like you literally has the ability and the opportunity to learn something new while you're doing the presentation. That is awesome.
Like some people, somebody else would be just like, I give a presentation and nobody, people seem to be disinterested in every go zone and I go home, right? Instead, during the task, you are learning, kind of a meta learning. You're learning about what you're doing.
I think I, I thought that is really, really good. That's how we improve, right? As we do something, you are also listening for feedback in this case and, and, um, noted it in your head. I mean, I would say that's pretty good.
Yeah, but also it's probably good to not learn that it'd be better to learn it before you go on stage. But I, Jay, I've seen, I've seen you on stage. I think it's fine.
And, but, but the honest about it, just tell the audience right there is a, hey, look, guys, you know, I just realized that, um, this good has been better.
Is, is that something that you feel like you're able to do? Maybe a little bit more transparently since you're, you're used to getting, I mean, let's be real. YouTube comments are not the healthiest place on the planet.
But is that something that, you know, if you're doing something for work, you're able to maybe feel, feel that response a little bit easier because of how it comes to you often on YouTube? No, I mean, this is not even YouTube. I think, you know, so I've been working for a while.
And being able to take feedback and be able to say I made a mistake and I'm wrong. It's that the fundamental things in working and kind of advancing in career, I think. Right. So I, I, I often will told is, hey, you know what? You're right.
Or I, you know what? I, I, I, I, I'm not doing a good job here. Tell me what should I do right now at the meeting. Um, it's the only way I think maybe I'm doing over simplified this.
But I really think if somebody's comes to saying that doesn't matter if you are the junior developer or you are the CTO, it will make everybody's not better. Yeah. I, I do think that there's, it's kind of like a double sided coin.
Like you, you probably know how you would prefer someone to tell you kind of a critique on a YouTube video.
So maybe you take that, that empathy back into a meeting when you're, when you're giving feedback on something, probably better than someone who, who never receives that type of feedback or they only receive it at work.
So they, they tend to be more guarded at work where, you know, for you, there's a huge part of your life where you're opening yourself up to, you know, the best and worst kinds of feedback and you, you know what you enjoy. Exactly. The random stranger is literally right. Yeah.
So I've, I've got one last question before we jump into our connections. Um, so we, we talked about this a little bit in the interview with Brad.
 Um, but, uh, for those that don't know, Brad, uh, is creator of the pen addict and, you know, he gets pen sent to him all the time and, you know, he, he has this, this mentality of like, you know, before he decides what to do or what not to do, he just, you know, he has to check, but is it fun first?
Uh, so I want to ask kind of a, a similar question to you is like, you, you, you enter, you like review so many different things, not just bags.
We've focused a lot on the bags here, but you've, you know, earlier today, you did the electronics of, yeah, you go from the, yeah. I think someone in the chat found a video that you did for like a projector, a project that's right. That's right.
What, what is the deciding factor of I am going to invest time and energy into this thing? Wow. That is a tough question. Um, if it's something that is different, um, I would definitely give it a try. So I, I, you know, run into parts that I never even knew existed.
Um, like, let's look to that project. It's a good one. I don't really use the projector a lot. And I never knew that they, you can wifi stream to a, you know, an affordable home project. So for that reason, I reviewed that thing. So something new.
Uh, and then the other thing is just something that I would use myself. So, and I think that is the, just like Brad, right? Like Brad is really into pens. Um, if it's something that I would use or, or, or my close friends and, and family would use, I tend to give those a lot more time.
Uh, even in the back world, you know, they're, for example, hiking backs, right? They have a lot of really cool stuff there. And I'm really not a hiker. And I, I do not do those because I, A, would not give those backs, um, uh, a worthy review. And then B, it just doesn't interest me either.
That's, I would say something personal. That's interesting because, you know, I don't know how, how much the, the bagging world is, but I feel like that's one of those areas that, you know, people spend a lot of money on bags. They spend a lot of money on equipment.
I can only imagine like you would probably get like really good, like affiliate revenue and things like that off of off of bags.
So you're willing to say like the money itself isn't necessarily the biggest importance because I mean, obviously you mentioned you have a job thing there, you know, but you also have this, this deciding factor of like, is this going to be beneficial to me? Or am I going to actually enjoy it?
So it's the first of all, a couple of things.
So I, you know, I'm not that, that, like a successful and then the review well, yeah, right? So I would say I pay for most of the, the stuff that I, um, review. Now sometimes, you know, I, that passed it on, maybe I'll sell it on a secondary market.
I do get backs from manufacturers sometimes and I tend to develop a relationship. So like they're the couple of companies that I just like the stuff. I, you know, met the, the design of the owner and I just really like the person.
Um, and once we click, right? So I tend to then do, um, their product more. And that's because they, their product again fits my use cases. But oh, so I mean, that's a joke that, that I have my kids, right? You know, the kids, these days, of course, they learn everything from YouTube.
And the joke is, you know, hey, you know, your dad is a YouTuber. How cool is that? And then followed by, you know, you would not believe how little money I make from the, uh, whatever the, the, the ad revenues. Yeah. Cool. Well, I've got one last question. I, I, I had one more other question.
This one more. This is a fun one. This is a fun one though. Okay. Um, so in that same interview with Brad, we talked about the, the, the, the mythical conduit bag.
What should a conduit bag have? What should our conductors have for the official bag that makes up all the things that allows people to conduit? Wow. That is a tall order.
I, so I'm going to go back to, um, to, to our pouch compensation, right? I think, and, and I mean, this is a metaphor, right? We all need less than we think.
So, yeah, what is the minimum set of sub that you or I need to carry to, to get our stuff done? Uh, and then maybe some kind of a, a, a smaller pouch, right?
So we all have a own set of tools, but we can put it in there with this, this, this bag with a nice, this pouch of the nice conduit local on it.
And then, uh, we can, can't do it with the pouch. Oh, so it's not even a backpack. It's just, it's a smaller bag. Yeah. Oh, that's, um, that's, I, I totally see that. I think we should, what's interesting? That's going. Okay. I know some people.
I know some people will have to, you know, let's get it done. Call, call Brad, they'll call Rick Shaw bags and we'll, we'll figure out how we can do it. But, like, Rick, I, I, I like Rick Shaw stuff, by the way. So let's, let's make this, let's make this happen. Come on. We can do this. Awesome.
Well, before we do that, one, I want to thank you for allowing me to put you in the hot seat and talk with you, you know, about all these things. This is fun. Now you're getting this is, this is wonderful. All right, PK, you, you've helped design the conduit bag.
Now it is time to design which you're going to be focusing on for the next couple of weeks. It is time for your connection. Um, I'll go first because I want to give you some time. Um, honestly, like I said, I, I know that we have a systems check coming up.
I feel like I've cheated because I think I've done this same connection, like three times since this last systems check. Um, I promise my system will not change its name because I still love the dummy method. I think it's great.
Um, but I do want to spend a little bit of time, um, doing what I call me son plus, which if you're into cooking, you know what that means. If you're not into cooking, that just means kind of taking inventory of all of your ingredients and having them laid out before you, before you start cooking.
So I want to kind of get an idea of what are all these applications that I'm using? What are all these tools that I'm using? What are, you know, my notebooks, my pens, all these things. Um, I just want to take stock and take inventory of all of that and understand what their role is in my system.
Because again, PK says that we, our bag isn't even a bag. It's more of a pouch. Exactly. That means I got to make sure that I'm only carrying the things that I need to carry, uh, in my system. So, yeah.
So my official connection is to, uh, meason plus my, uh, systems and tools, uh, to prepare for the system, upcoming systems check. So my mind is back. Yeah, certainly heard it many times on your show, but it is, uh, applied to me as well. So I moved home back earlier this year.
And so I have a home office set up kind of actually in, in the area of the living room. And I've been playing with the office set up forever. I, it's still a mess. And I really, really, really mean to organize it because now I know how what set up I should use. I just haven't done it.
So I want to come in to get the set up done so that I can stop worrying about the mess in front of behind me. On the bright side, I'm sure you have enough bags that as you're moving things, you can just put them in bags and put the bag where you need that thing to go. Too sure. Awesome.
Well, I, I hope that you'll, you'll give us an update, uh, before the next episode, so we can let people know how well you did on that.
And speaking on that, we do have some folks that gave us connections for the next conduit as well, which our first one is railsy, our trained enthusiasts of the show, accidentally missed their original connection. They got a duck. The duck is for focus. It is the focus duck.
Now we need to talk to the people at the focus podcast and have them make a duck. Called the focus duck. But they're going to try and look at how to better focus while at home. Maybe it's the focus duck. Maybe it's something else.
What about our, our guitars of the show? Isn't this a repeat on, yeah, you need that. Oh, yep. This is just Scott reminding us again, go grab one of those shirts and maybe there will be a bag in the future at Yukonware.com. That's right.
About let's actually jump down to Kathy, our unicorn of the show, who gave us an update as well. Let's see. That's right. So condition for next conduit is to, here you go. Clean off my desk for the junk that I'm not using and it's taking up space to not let me access the things that I'm using.
Sounds like we're both in the same, same connection there. Kathy, you know, and then our soprano of the show says, uh, next connection, slowly worked my way back into normal routines and don't overdo it. See, there we go.
That's, that was the thing we talked about, you know, for who it was, I think it was so who said, you know, overestimating what could get done. Deborah is doing the thing here of saying, Hey, let me make sure that I don't overdo it this time. That you're not this time, but I don't overdo it.
That is, that is so awesome. And, uh, yeah, best of luck on that. Next we have our up the show. Uh, case says, continue the job research and have a list of places to definitely apply to, if I haven't applied already. So good luck with that. I know that's a very, very hot things to do.
Our nameless of the show, Robert says complete the connection. I put a pin on, uh, and start buying ingredients for Thanksgiving dinner. And I also got an update from Robert. He said the next time that they go to Disneyland, I'm totally invited.
Uh, so see, next up, what do we have? I'll recall the show. So it says, I've got a busy next two weeks. Uh, goes to plan a seminar, a tense, I'm training and the research date and spend a few mornings on writing, just to keep the writing habit going. That's a lot of work. That is a lot.
Uh, remember try not to overdo it. That's, that's what we, that's what we learned last time. Uh, and then our blue dragon at the show, Skye says to create an intentionality. There are tools that I use for a purpose, but there are times that I don't know exactly what that purpose is.
The connection is to take the time and write down how I use these tools and what purpose they're serving in my system. It sounds like you're getting ready for the connection. The systems check just like I am. Um, Skye, uh, I wish you the best of luck there.
And I, I can't wait to learn more about how you're doing that, um, which I'm sure you will update system and themes.
And, uh, if you want to learn more about the system and themes that I'm making or that Skyler's making or the PK might be making, um, you can do so by becoming a member of the Relay FM family. Go to relay.
fm slash conduit and become a member today or just a reminder, uh, starting next week, you can go to give relay.com and you will get 20% off on the annual purchase, uh, for the first year.
 And, uh, if you want to submit a connection, you can do so by tweeting on Twitter, uh, as long as that's still around, uh, at conduit FM using the hashtag, my conduit or again, if you are a member going to the Relay FM discord with question mark, my conduit, um, and a special thank you to PK, uh, PK, let people know where they can find you around the internet.
Yeah. So my name is unique enough. PK, S H I U on Instagram, YouTube everywhere. The only thing that's different, let's talk about Twitter is I have a three letter, uh, Twitter username, PK, S, but then who knows? Maybe that's not going to be around for a long either.
Oh, man, I remember when those used to be worth so much. And now you're like, my investments. Uh, and also, I thank you to our sponsor master class for sponsoring this week's episode, uh, PK, normally we end this show by just asking, um, did we do it? We totally can't do it.
