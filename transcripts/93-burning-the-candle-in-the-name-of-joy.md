Sunday was my kiddos 16th birthday and their party. Yay, they take their driving tests soon and I'm very excited for that

But that night I went to a midnight book release party for on extorm, the newest, I guess they're called the Imperium Saga or something. The fourth wing book, the newest one. So I got to hang out with a bunch of people that were fans of books and reading and fantasy and that was so much fun But it's a midnight release party which meant like these people ordered their books. I did not get a book from the small business because I don't do physical books. I'm an ebook girly. And so it like just loaded to my Kindle automatically. But I got to hang out with friends and met new friends
But it's a midnight release party which meant like these people ordered their books. I did not get a book from the small business because I don't do physical books. I'm an ebook girly.

And then this morning I got to interview some Wheel of Time people, which was incredible
And that was really nice. But again, got home after 1230. And then this morning I got to interview some Wheel of Time people, which was incredible But very stressful four minutes, which is all the time I had with one person and then four minutes also with a pairing of two people, which not a lot of time. But they also had, you know, they'd been doing this all day. And so it was, it was great. I was so lucky to be able to do it
But very stressful four minutes, which is all the time I had with one person and then four minutes also with a pairing of two people, which not a lot of time. But they also had, you know, they'd been doing this all day. And so it was, it was great. I was so lucky to be able to do it But it was a very stressful time period. But in that, in that all of these days, there's nothing that I would have even wanted to say no to. Even if I had known at the time when I was planning each of them that all of them would be stacked up the days that they are
But it was a very stressful time period. But in that, in that all of these days, there's nothing that I would have even wanted to say no to. Even if I had known at the time when I was planning each of them that all of them would be stacked up the days that they are And so my idea for this topic is saying yes, even using, you know, the Marie Kondo idea does this, you know, Spark Joy. What do you do when it does Spark Joy? And it all sparks joy and it still can be too much. I have thoughts. I have ideas
And so my idea for this topic is saying yes, even using, you know, the Marie Kondo idea does this, you know, Spark Joy. What do you do when it does Spark Joy? And it all sparks joy and it still can be too much. I have thoughts. I have ideas I have ideas. Which ones do you want first? So the thoughts are the factual answer to that question. Well, let's start with thoughts. Okay, so the thoughts are, oof, that sounds like a lot. It says someone that does a lot often. So I can see when someone's overburdened
I have ideas. Which ones do you want first? So the thoughts are the factual answer to that question. Well, let's start with thoughts. Okay, so the thoughts are, oof, that sounds like a lot. It says someone that does a lot often. So I can see when someone's overburdened Yeah, it's that, that is the challenge. I think we, we talked about this a little bit in the pre show, but like I have been consistently saying no to a thing, but like also teasing to the person that I'm telling no, that it's like, I really want to do this again
Yeah, it's that, that is the challenge. I think we, we talked about this a little bit in the pre show, but like I have been consistently saying no to a thing, but like also teasing to the person that I'm telling no, that it's like, I really want to do this again But it's like also, I know that I can't. Yes. Like me saying yes to that would be catastrophic. But also there is, there is something about like just saying yes. I think I could get an example of this in my current time frame is my April looks really bad. Oh, no
But it's like also, I know that I can't. Yes. Like me saying yes to that would be catastrophic. But also there is, there is something about like just saying yes. I think I could get an example of this in my current time frame is my April looks really bad. Oh, no Oh, no. It's like, Kathy, if you record an episode with me in April, it will be a miracle because, well, this is bad because my April is also really busy. That's also around the time that our 100th episode is supposed to be happening. I know, I know
Oh, no. It's like, Kathy, if you record an episode with me in April, it will be a miracle because, well, this is bad because my April is also really busy. That's also around the time that our 100th episode is supposed to be happening. I know, I know I know, I know. And yeah, we're going to have to talk about this because the 15th that we record is I'll be in Memphis. I'll be in Amsterdam. Okay. Cool. Cool. Cool. So yeah, we'll we'll take this off there. We'll figure that out. We'll find y'all. Yeah
I know, I know. And yeah, we're going to have to talk about this because the 15th that we record is I'll be in Memphis. I'll be in Amsterdam. Okay. Cool. Cool. Cool. So yeah, we'll we'll take this off there. We'll figure that out. We'll find y'all. Yeah Yeah. So meanwhile, I in the midst of finding out that like, Hey, my April looking kind of stupid right now, I also just submitted to speak at two more events and guess what they are April. Oh, how did you know? Wow. Oh, my goodness
Yeah. So meanwhile, I in the midst of finding out that like, Hey, my April looking kind of stupid right now, I also just submitted to speak at two more events and guess what they are April. Oh, how did you know? Wow. Oh, my goodness Oh, my goodness. Not to mention that May is then our big like developer or it's like our big like nonprofit month. That's when we try to raise all of our money. Basically for the entire year at the nonprofit. So there's just, there's like so much going on
Oh, my goodness. Not to mention that May is then our big like developer or it's like our big like nonprofit month. That's when we try to raise all of our money. Basically for the entire year at the nonprofit. So there's just, there's like so much going on And it's like, ah, I, I, yeah, I made a mistake by existing and people who thought April would be great. Why, why did you do this to me? Yeah. And again, at the time, like I can justify every single decision, you know, to the events that I'm speaking at one of them, they asked me to speak
And it's like, ah, I, I, yeah, I made a mistake by existing and people who thought April would be great. Why, why did you do this to me? Yeah. And again, at the time, like I can justify every single decision, you know, to the events that I'm speaking at one of them, they asked me to speak So I was like, Oh, of course, you know, if you're going to, if you're going to pay for me to come speak at your event, then I'm going to show up at your event. But, but also like, my employer expects me to be an Amsterdam, you know, three or four days before I have to go speak at that event
So I was like, Oh, of course, you know, if you're going to, if you're going to pay for me to come speak at your event, then I'm going to show up at your event. But, but also like, my employer expects me to be an Amsterdam, you know, three or four days before I have to go speak at that event So I'm literally flying from Atlanta to Amsterdam and then from Amsterdam straight to Austin, Texas. And then I get back and it's like, Oh, but don't forget there's that other event that you have to go to that's also in April
So I'm literally flying from Atlanta to Amsterdam and then from Amsterdam straight to Austin, Texas. And then I get back and it's like, Oh, but don't forget there's that other event that you have to go to that's also in April And then when you get back from that, there's that other that you have to go to that's also in April. But it's a part of my job. And I think that that's that's kind of the way that I'm looking at it is some of this is for my career. Some of this is for my job
And then when you get back from that, there's that other that you have to go to that's also in April. But it's a part of my job. And I think that that's that's kind of the way that I'm looking at it is some of this is for my career. Some of this is for my job Most of this is for my job, but some of this is for my career. And that's also the start of baseball season, which I don't know if you remember Kathy, but this is a special year for me because it's the first. Well, it's the first year that I will be a season ticket holder
Most of this is for my job, but some of this is for my career. And that's also the start of baseball season, which I don't know if you remember Kathy, but this is a special year for me because it's the first. Well, it's the first year that I will be a season ticket holder So there's, there's a lot of like I just want to go to as many games as possible when I have a break. But also the reality is I've kind of already paid for all these tickets
So there's, there's a lot of like I just want to go to as many games as possible when I have a break. But also the reality is I've kind of already paid for all these tickets So like, I don't have a like I can resell them, but there's there's that added stress of feeling like saying no comes with kind of this weird penalty that's not like, Oh, people would be mad or people would be upset
So like, I don't have a like I can resell them, but there's there's that added stress of feeling like saying no comes with kind of this weird penalty that's not like, Oh, people would be mad or people would be upset It's just like, Oh, no, you like you've already like, there will be a financial hit taken if you don't do the thing that you're trying to do
It's just like, Oh, no, you like you've already like, there will be a financial hit taken if you don't do the thing that you're trying to do Yeah, there will be a career hit when if you don't do the thing that, that, you know, people are asking of you to do or there won't be a there will be a, I guess, reputational hit, which also like I should also mention to that, there is the world of saying no and setting those boundaries is relatively important
Yeah, there will be a career hit when if you don't do the thing that, that, you know, people are asking of you to do or there won't be a there will be a, I guess, reputational hit, which also like I should also mention to that, there is the world of saying no and setting those boundaries is relatively important And also, why say yes to something that you're going to do a bad job at. Yeah. Yeah, that's, that's, ooh, Laura's got a good point. And also you can sell those tickets, right? You can resell them. I can
And also, why say yes to something that you're going to do a bad job at. Yeah. Yeah, that's, that's, ooh, Laura's got a good point. And also you can sell those tickets, right? You can resell them. I can I can. I just reselling your tickets doesn't mean like putting them back on the market doesn't mean that they will be purchased. It just means they're back on the market. Well, yeah, so like that is still an option that you can do. Yeah. Yeah
I can. I just reselling your tickets doesn't mean like putting them back on the market doesn't mean that they will be purchased. It just means they're back on the market. Well, yeah, so like that is still an option that you can do. Yeah. Yeah Yeah. Yeah. And that'll be what I do is I will probably put the majority of my tickets in April back on sale and hope that someone please buy them. Yeah. Well, I hope, yeah, I hope that works out that it's, yeah, it's so difficult. This balance and I think it's one of these days
Yeah. Yeah. And that'll be what I do is I will probably put the majority of my tickets in April back on sale and hope that someone please buy them. Yeah. Well, I hope, yeah, I hope that works out that it's, yeah, it's so difficult. This balance and I think it's one of these days Maybe I'll go to, you know, only having one career, but that's not anytime soon. But also, I don't want to say no to all of this stuff because I have been doing it for so long and I have this level of like trust and joy and whatnot filled out. And I have so much fun with all of the things
Maybe I'll go to, you know, only having one career, but that's not anytime soon. But also, I don't want to say no to all of this stuff because I have been doing it for so long and I have this level of like trust and joy and whatnot filled out. And I have so much fun with all of the things But when they all layer together, it's hard. But also, what would I say no to? What would like, what would I say no to? Well, and that is where like the suggestion comes in on this is this is the practical application of what I did this week. Yeah
But when they all layer together, it's hard. But also, what would I say no to? What would like, what would I say no to? Well, and that is where like the suggestion comes in on this is this is the practical application of what I did this week. Yeah Yeah. This week I have, let's see, yesterday was yesterday.

And then Thursday and Friday, I have to go to Washington, DC to participate in an event. So like this entire week gross, so gross. But you know, you know what I did to prevent it from becoming even grosser? What? I set my calendar to not allow me to accept events this week. Oh, smart Oh, smart. It just like auto declines events. Nice. Like, hey, I'd like to schedule some time with you. Nope. That's yeah, that's really smart. Irizano. Oh gosh, I'm so sorry. I butchered because I don't have the cheat sheet in front of me.

I butchered because I don't have the cheat sheet in front of me. Hold on. Let me go back over here I thought that was right. Irizano. Is it? Is it? Okay. Okay. I'm questioning everything. But in the chat, they said over the years, it got a lot easier for me to say no to things I actually don't really want to do. But when it comes to things, I really do want to do. And oh, my gosh, yes
I thought that was right. Irizano. Is it? Is it? Okay. Okay. I'm questioning everything. But in the chat, they said over the years, it got a lot easier for me to say no to things I actually don't really want to do. But when it comes to things, I really do want to do. And oh, my gosh, yes Like and and Laura comes in and like, I feel like sometimes you do say yes to all the exciting things, as long as the everything happening at once is an irregular thing, then you could just schedule rest before and after as much as you can. Yeah, this, this is this is kind of where I'm at now
Like and and Laura comes in and like, I feel like sometimes you do say yes to all the exciting things, as long as the everything happening at once is an irregular thing, then you could just schedule rest before and after as much as you can. Yeah, this, this is this is kind of where I'm at now Um, but also I need to set this balance to, you know, there are other people that can do some of these things. Obviously, I can't, you know, pawn off my kiddos birthday party. Sure you can. I right
Um, but also I need to set this balance to, you know, there are other people that can do some of these things. Obviously, I can't, you know, pawn off my kiddos birthday party. Sure you can. I right I right. Well, the question is, is would they want you to pawn it off because you're like, you're like, hey, kiddo, you know what? This is your birthday. Have fun. You're in charge. You're the boss. Right. Well, I know it's, it's so funny, though, because actually they did the opposite
I right. Well, the question is, is would they want you to pawn it off because you're like, you're like, hey, kiddo, you know what? This is your birthday. Have fun. You're in charge. You're the boss. Right. Well, I know it's, it's so funny, though, because actually they did the opposite They trusted me to do the majority of the planning. They were like, mom, will you come and here's a Pinterest board of the things that I want to do. Um, and I would like you to plan it. And I'm like, oh, okay, trust me
They trusted me to do the majority of the planning. They were like, mom, will you come and here's a Pinterest board of the things that I want to do. Um, and I would like you to plan it. And I'm like, oh, okay, trust me Um, um, and then I ask if they wanted me to like, here's the things that I did so that they could approve it, which they greatly appreciated.

Um, um, and then I ask if they wanted me to like, here's the things that I did so that they could approve it, which they greatly appreciated. And I was just like to say that they said yes to all of the things I suggested. And um, they had an incredible time And I'm so, I'm so happy, especially after Saturday, that super long day at the dance competition.

Well, that's like, I have to do all the ready work That's the other part that I was going to say, take a play from my corporate playbook here. Um, one of the things that I have to do is I, I actually worked yesterday, um, because I had to do annual review stuff to get ready for where I'm going in my career kind of things
That's the other part that I was going to say, take a play from my corporate playbook here. Um, one of the things that I have to do is I, I actually worked yesterday, um, because I had to do annual review stuff to get ready for where I'm going in my career kind of things But a part of that was, hey, yesterday was supposed to be a holiday for employees in the US. I think for therapy or something. Um, but yeah, but because of that, you know, one of the things that we talk about on our team is like, no, get your time off
But a part of that was, hey, yesterday was supposed to be a holiday for employees in the US. I think for therapy or something. Um, but yeah, but because of that, you know, one of the things that we talk about on our team is like, no, get your time off Um, last year, I wound up losing like two weeks of vacation time. Like, I don't, I don't get any money for that. I don't get to get that time this year. It, it gone. Oh, man. There, there is very much the reality of, if you work on a holiday, you're expected to take a day off

There is, there is no ifans or butts about it, especially like spoiler alert. I might be becoming a manager soon. And if I'm a manager and it turns out that you're not taking your time off, like that's a conversation because I, I want the people who report to me to be in their best possible And that means I got a way to extra day or I got to take something off their plate so that they can be rest relaxed and ready to rock. Like, that's important. So it's, it's fine if you burn the candle this time, but you got to promise that like, okay, I'm going to do this
And that means I got a way to extra day or I got to take something off their plate so that they can be rest relaxed and ready to rock. Like, that's important.

I did my workshop this, this morning and the workshop is the one that uses the conduit transcriptions So there was the whole part where like I have to show people how I made this AI thing to use conduit to give advice and the questions that I always put in there are how can I set better boundaries? And how can I get better at saying no
So there was the whole part where like I have to show people how I made this AI thing to use conduit to give advice and the questions that I always put in there are how can I set better boundaries? And how can I get better at saying no So there is there is just that I'm going to throw that out there
So there is there is just that I'm going to throw that out there But also the presentation tomorrow, the thing that I did, it was out of like all the things.

But also the presentation tomorrow, the thing that I did, it was out of like all the things. And yes, it was like a quarter of the work that I've been helping put in with all of these amazing people. And a lot of them were looking at me like, Jay, it's the final presentation We can't wait for you to knock it out of the park because presenting is what you do. And my response to them was, you know what, this was a team effort
We can't wait for you to knock it out of the park because presenting is what you do. And my response to them was, you know what, this was a team effort How about the team does the presentation instead of just me getting up there and doing it? And a part of that was like, I want them to feel all of the same awesomeness that I get to feel when I go on stage and do the thing. But you know, it's also better
How about the team does the presentation instead of just me getting up there and doing it? And a part of that was like, I want them to feel all of the same awesomeness that I get to feel when I go on stage and do the thing. But you know, it's also better I don't have to stress about giving that presentation. Yes. And our manager was like, Jay, we just want you to know that we're so excited for this presentation. And we're more than happy to let you go and do this thing. But don't feel like you need to stress yourself out about doing it
I don't have to stress about giving that presentation. Yes. And our manager was like, Jay, we just want you to know that we're so excited for this presentation. And we're more than happy to let you go and do this thing. But don't feel like you need to stress yourself out about doing it And I'm like, oh, no, no, no, no, no. I am perfectly fine letting the team handle this. So I think that I think that there is there is the level of it's important if this thing exists in the world. But also it's it's perfectly okay if I'm not the person that brings it into existence
And I'm like, oh, no, no, no, no, no. I am perfectly fine letting the team handle this. So I think that I think that there is there is the level of it's important if this thing exists in the world. But also it's it's perfectly okay if I'm not the person that brings it into existence That is that is a thing that I think finally got me some of the quote unquote recognition that I wasn't even seeking. I feel like I don't want to be like, oh, I wasn't really thinking about it and I got awarded. No, it was nice to get awarded. It was nice to be recognized
That is that is a thing that I think finally got me some of the quote unquote recognition that I wasn't even seeking. I feel like I don't want to be like, oh, I wasn't really thinking about it and I got awarded. No, it was nice to get awarded. It was nice to be recognized But I think the thing that that brought it to existence was the last few times where I've done a thing the following year when someone was like, hey, are you going to do that thing again? I was just like, you know what? Honestly, you could probably do it. Let me just let me show you how I did it
But I think the thing that that brought it to existence was the last few times where I've done a thing the following year when someone was like, hey, are you going to do that thing again? I was just like, you know what? Honestly, you could probably do it. Let me just let me show you how I did it And then you get on a call with them and then they do all the hard work. Yeah. Yeah, that's a nice that's a nice thing about having like team members to help with. And I'm so thankful for the unicorns that are doing a lot. Oh, best part is those aren't even team members
And then you get on a call with them and then they do all the hard work. Yeah. Yeah, that's a nice that's a nice thing about having like team members to help with. And I'm so thankful for the unicorns that are doing a lot. Oh, best part is those aren't even team members Those are just people who are like, oh, hey, we love that you do this thing for the community. And I was like, hey, you can do it too. Oh, amazing. That's even better. Yes, manipulation of your audience. Oh, that's so good. If you'll haven't realized it, we are the productivity evil geniuses
Those are just people who are like, oh, hey, we love that you do this thing for the community. And I was like, hey, you can do it too. Oh, amazing. That's even better. Yes, manipulation of your audience. Oh, that's so good. If you'll haven't realized it, we are the productivity evil geniuses I love that. Yes. We're brilliant at that. I'm going to own it, I guess. Oh gosh. So yeah, like, why do I do this to myself? But also, I'm so happy. Yeah. Yeah. And it's a balance. I'm learning. And I have said no to things, which I'm super happy for
I love that. Yes. We're brilliant at that. I'm going to own it, I guess. Oh gosh. So yeah, like, why do I do this to myself? But also, I'm so happy. Yeah. Yeah. And it's a balance. I'm learning. And I have said no to things, which I'm super happy for And I just got an inquiry earlier today that I'm going to push off because I could do it tomorrow. But I'm not going to take a nap. Exactly. Exactly. So yeah, I'm going to be a smart business person and push it off to next week. Yeah
And I just got an inquiry earlier today that I'm going to push off because I could do it tomorrow. But I'm not going to take a nap. Exactly. Exactly. So yeah, I'm going to be a smart business person and push it off to next week. Yeah Yeah. I remember when I first got into like podcast editing, like the thing that I did to torch myself and eight podcast editing in the future was that I just accepted every task
Yeah. I remember when I first got into like podcast editing, like the thing that I did to torch myself and eight podcast editing in the future was that I just accepted every task I feel like it's such a good, like, when you can be selective and just if you tell clients, no, oh, they want to work with you even more after that. Yeah. Yeah. No, I did have, I had an intro call last week with a client that's going to start and it's going to book
I feel like it's such a good, like, when you can be selective and just if you tell clients, no, oh, they want to work with you even more after that. Yeah. Yeah. No, I did have, I had an intro call last week with a client that's going to start and it's going to book And we're going to be doing weekly chats to kind of do like business support type things, which by the way, frickin love doing that. It's one of my favorites. I have some incredible clients that do this work. And it makes me so happy to do to work with them and see their growth and whatnot
And we're going to be doing weekly chats to kind of do like business support type things, which by the way, frickin love doing that. It's one of my favorites. I have some incredible clients that do this work. And it makes me so happy to do to work with them and see their growth and whatnot If anyone wants to reach out, visit the unicornsidekick.com for that. But we were looking at trying to set that schedule in the calendar. And I wanted to like, he was asking to like start this week
If anyone wants to reach out, visit the unicornsidekick.com for that. But we were looking at trying to set that schedule in the calendar. And I wanted to like, he was asking to like start this week And so I threw out a couple dates and we scheduled and the way his like, he had a project coming up that was going to like take a lot of time in in the space and like had a couple hour meeting one of these days. And I was like, you know what? Let's start next week
And so I threw out a couple dates and we scheduled and the way his like, he had a project coming up that was going to like take a lot of time in in the space and like had a couple hour meeting one of these days. And I was like, you know what? Let's start next week Like this is not something that needs to happen now. We're not on a major time crunch. Let's just start a week later. And it was like a light went off on his head and it's like, oh, yeah, brilliant. Yes. Let's do that. And so we're starting next week
Like this is not something that needs to happen now. We're not on a major time crunch. Let's just start a week later. And it was like a light went off on his head and it's like, oh, yeah, brilliant. Yes. Let's do that. And so we're starting next week And I'm like super happy because I would be like sad if it was this week because I want to make sure that I give him my full like effort and attention. And yes, balance isn't ever changing state. Like sometimes a little more one way, sometimes a little more the other way. Otherwise, it's just flat
And I'm like super happy because I would be like sad if it was this week because I want to make sure that I give him my full like effort and attention. And yes, balance isn't ever changing state. Like sometimes a little more one way, sometimes a little more the other way. Otherwise, it's just flat That's such a good, you know, one of the first episodes we talked about how like work life balance isn't real because it's not consistent. And like, I think it's important to remember that it's going to be constantly changing. It's a living document. It's a living like space
That's such a good, you know, one of the first episodes we talked about how like work life balance isn't real because it's not consistent. And like, I think it's important to remember that it's going to be constantly changing. It's a living document. It's a living like space And so balance doesn't mean it's going to be perfectly balanced at all times, but that you have to be aware of it and work with it to make it to make it work. And I think that's that's a really important thing to know. I like to look at it as a work life credit score
And so balance doesn't mean it's going to be perfectly balanced at all times, but that you have to be aware of it and work with it to make it to make it work. And I think that's that's a really important thing to know. I like to look at it as a work life credit score Like it can't be, you don't have a balanced credit score. You can have a really good credit score. You can have like a, ooh, I sometimes I do overstep, but when I overstep, I make sure that I get it back. And I pay it back on the back end. And I do it quickly and promptly. And I'm never late
Like it can't be, you don't have a balanced credit score. You can have a really good credit score. You can have like a, ooh, I sometimes I do overstep, but when I overstep, I make sure that I get it back. And I pay it back on the back end. And I do it quickly and promptly. And I'm never late And I'm never late. You know, overcharging myself. And I'm never taking too much on that I can't afford to give myself back. But also, I think that there comes to a like, if you just said no to everything, that's also bad. Like no credit is just as bad as bad credit
And I'm never late. You know, overcharging myself. And I'm never taking too much on that I can't afford to give myself back. But also, I think that there comes to a like, if you just said no to everything, that's also bad. Like no credit is just as bad as bad credit So like you have to, you have to be willing to give yourself a little bit of like, hey, I'm going to stretch a little here. But also, we're making it up on the back end over here. And I think that helps. Yeah, I agree. So good job everybody. I'm proud of us all. We did it
So like you have to, you have to be willing to give yourself a little bit of like, hey, I'm going to stretch a little here. But also, we're making it up on the back end over here. And I think that helps. Yeah, I agree. So good job everybody. I'm proud of us all. We did it We did it. So are we forcing you to make your connection to take another nap? I think so. That is absolutely going to be my connection is to rest. And oh my goodness. Yes, Irizzano, I absolutely. Okay
We did it. So are we forcing you to make your connection to take another nap? I think so. That is absolutely going to be my connection is to rest. And oh my goodness. Yes, Irizzano, I absolutely. Okay Okay. So just put my knee jerk reaction to feeling overwhelmed and burnt out is completely swing the other way and isolate myself and stop talking to friends, which actually does not help me at all. And oh my gosh. I just call that Monday. I feel that so hard
Okay. So just put my knee jerk reaction to feeling overwhelmed and burnt out is completely swing the other way and isolate myself and stop talking to friends, which actually does not help me at all. And oh my gosh. I just call that Monday. I feel that so hard Like that is absolutely when I really hit burnout, you know, last year. And I just was like curling up in the corner. All I wanted to do was sit on the couch and like do nothing. And I knew that it was not going to help because I couldn't. I'm very much an extrovert
Like that is absolutely when I really hit burnout, you know, last year. And I just was like curling up in the corner. All I wanted to do was sit on the couch and like do nothing. And I knew that it was not going to help because I couldn't. I'm very much an extrovert And I was not able to recharge that battery if I also cut myself off and said nothing. And so it was definitely a delicate balance to try and figure out how to make sure that it was the right balance. And that self-awareness, I think, is an important piece of kind of life in general
And I was not able to recharge that battery if I also cut myself off and said nothing. And so it was definitely a delicate balance to try and figure out how to make sure that it was the right balance. And that self-awareness, I think, is an important piece of kind of life in general Being able to identify what you need. And even if it's really hard to do or acknowledge. And I think that's important to know. Yeah. I am definitely a fan of Kathy getting rest as your connection. Kathy, I think my connection. I don't know what it's going to be actually
Being able to identify what you need. And even if it's really hard to do or acknowledge. And I think that's important to know. Yeah. I am definitely a fan of Kathy getting rest as your connection.

I do know what it's going to be. I'm going to do work on my presentations. I'm going to I'm going to smartgoal this even though I don't like. Smartgoal I know. I can't think of a good acronym for dumb. Oh, I actually. Oh, asking AI. Don't be acronym for smart goals. Make one for dumb. Um, goals Um, goals.
