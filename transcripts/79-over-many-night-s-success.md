From really FM, you're listening to Conduit, the show where we Condu are own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that surprisingly surprises with surprise guests. I'm Kathy and with me today is not Jay who is currently off somewhere on a secret mission.
So instead, I have with me today the original friend of the show, Maddie, also known as chaos in the discord. Hi Maddie. Hi. Oh my gosh, there's a so fun. I'm so excited. I'm so happy you're here. So happy you're here, especially since you know, Jay decided to leave me again last minute.
He we were trying to set it up just record a different day and it just wasn't working. And then he's like, you know what? Just just find a guess. And then start lifting off like guest ideas that he had with people that I don't know. Oh Jay, I love you. I do.
But I'm not going to last minute because it was what like two days before you asked me. Yeah, I think you asked me two days ago. Yeah, yeah.
I'm not going to introduce myself to somebody that I don't know and beg them to come and be a guest on the show last minute for a show that they may not have listened to or no one's going on. Again, to somebody that I don't know, like I can make it work absolutely, but it's terrifying.
It could have been funny, but it probably just would have been stressful. Yeah. You know, you know what? Both of these things can be true. Yes, that's true. Yeah. It can be hilarious and stressful. Like so many soup did a master class yesterday for a dance event.
This big time choreographer was in town and so we went and they got picked out like to do special small groups. They got picked twice once just with themselves with about like 10 other dancers and then another with like 20 and the larger group went first that that group of 20, not larger event.
They did do it all the same, but there's there's like a eight count and a half of like an improv section. And the first time that they went up, they did the most awkward like ran off and like down on the ground and like lifted their leg like they were eight again.
And it's so funny because they were absolutely horrified and embarrassed, but also found it to be the funniest thing ever because they thought that they were going to do something cool, but their brain just kind of broke in the middle of it. We finished it.
Like I know how on video the funniest thing that they've ever done. It sounds like they kind of like reverted to what they knew best because they've been doing it for so long. It's the time when they were in the smaller group.
They did like an actual, you know, an aerial into a death drop type thing. So like it did work out eventually, but the fact that this is what they just kind of defaulted to and it wasn't even pretty like their feet weren't pointed. Their legs were straight.
It was the funniest, funniest thing I've ever seen. And I'm so glad they also found it funny because if I, if obviously if they didn't, I wouldn't share the story because, but yeah, yeah, it was.
Oh, well, since Jay isn't here, I will be doing both this week in the discord and last week in the co-working and this week in the discord.
There's chaos as per usual, but the extra chaos is coming for this month's spotlight, which is finally with Mike Hurley, who bullied me into allowing him to be a guest on that members only show we will be talking all about the relay 10 event in London, which is happening at the end of the month.
And let me tell you, when I have the countdown, I have the countdown on my phone. And as of today, I leave in 14 days, which is terrifying. Dear God, that's not good. That's not so fast. That's not so fast. I'm a little nervous, but it's going to be great. It's going to be so much fun.
I cannot wait to see everybody that's going to be there. I'm going to miss you if you won't be there. But yeah, it's going to be a good time. It's going to be a wonderful time.
And last week in the co-working, we and our superconductor friends joined Pillix on food deliveries while we gently bullied him into starting the freelancing projects.
So Pillix is nervous about starting freelancing and like, what do I charge? Who do I talk to? Like what's going to be there? Like what was happening? And I think, and Pillix, remind me if you're wrong or if we're wrong, that we are getting you into that phase. I think we're going to make it.
Think, you know, we adore you and are here to support you, but also you can do it. You can do it. And yeah, he says he feels like he's going to be bullied again. Well, yes. So this next week, we will bully you as Navy.
If you would like to join us on our next co-working session in the off weeks with myself and Jay or some of our lovely friends and be bullied into doing what you know you want to do anyways with love, of course, and consent. Or you can also be live as we're recording in the discord.
You can join and be a superconductor, which means you can get all of that and more. All you have to do is visit I am a superconductor.com to become a member today. That's letter I letter M letter A superconductor.com. Ooh, so I'm so sorry. So so forth going to join us in co-working next week.
So they could be bullied into doing their connection, but has decided to be on holiday, on holiday instead. So instead, we will bully them in discord, friendly consent, consensually with love. But yeah, you know, that's a gift that we provide to our seniors.
We also provide that gift in, you know, break room. We just gently bully everyone in there too. Yes. That's very true. That's very true. Yes.
If you are a fan of Maddie, they hang out, she hangs out in a hashtag break room in the discord, which is why everyone in the live chat was very excited because they adore her, just like, oh no. And it's now time. Let's do our connection checks. All right. Okay.
So I didn't put mine in the discord two weeks ago, but over the past two weeks, I've been trying to get a writing group set up, which we'll talk about a little bit later. And I had that done our next, our first check in, I should say, is Thursday. So two days from now, really exciting.
That's amazing. So my connection was to take care of the recycling in my office. Now, technically, I should do a yellow heart right now because it's still in my office. However, it is gathered and it's flattened.
It's just too hot to take it outside because then I have to put on shoes and I keep forgetting when I'm going out to do other things to take it with me. But by the time, like, after we're done recording, I'm going to put my shoes on and take it outside.
So it will technically be a solid green by the time the show goes up. So okay. That's fair. I think that's why I'm giving myself a green in that. Yeah. All right. Time for our conductors.
We have our Carl of all trades at the show who has a green check mark talked to the owner of the venue over an excellent old fashioned, always good. And she was elated at the idea. Just need to email a date and get it on the schedule. Jay, here's the menu.
So you can see they do have things other than beer. I will make sure that Jay sees the link. And that's so exciting. I'm so glad that the owner was as excited as you are. And I can't wait to hear how it happens. All right. So I'm up next for a sofa connection check with the yellow heart.
Sof is our Oracle of the show. So they still haven't found their passport documents, but they did complete a journal article that has been a connection for most of this year. So that is half a win. Sof that is definitely a full win. If you've been working on that for a year, definitely.
You worked on it nonstop through the weekend and on your day off. You need to take a break, friend, Oracle of the show. Sof, take a break. You deserve it. Also, you should have given yourself a checkmark. I'm just saying.
Yes, that is a green heart level because that just means that your connection changed. And I think we've appropriately bullied you to do your passport documents just so that I will officially rule stew as a separate third item option in the soup or sandwich. Debacle conversation, but only for so.
Sof will be the only one that will allow stew to be a separate thing from stew or super sandwich rulings. So you're welcome. Our Canadian trivia card enthusiast of the show Erica says connection check a green heart.
I stayed off my broken toe as much as I can walk with only the littlest hobble, which is important because I'm flying to visit my parents next week. Yeah, it's not fun to travel like with pain and and and having that. So I'm glad that it's healing well enough for you to go on your visit.
Proud of you. Right. Up next is Debo are soprano of the show connection check. Green heart finished the appliqu√©s on the baby quilt. They're working on see creativity in the discord for a photo. He saw this a couple days ago. It is freaking gorgeous.
How did you like the breathtaking? I am shocked anytime anyone can make anything out of like fabric. Like it doesn't my brain doesn't work. But yeah, it's absolutely glorious. Our podcast listener of the show Pilix says connection check yellow square.
I applied for jobs and set up a calendar event for the co working, but fast UI didn't make it this time. Do have more contacts and sent more emails for jobs though, which I don't usually do.
Uh, again, sounds like a green square or green shape of some sort, but again, you are valid in your yellow, but also I think it's a green because you got you got stuff done. Up next are identical twin of the show Aaron. Uh, connection check.
Green circle put my trip notes together booked some day of tickets that I wanted and put my hiking plans together as well, feeling pretty ready. Just need to buy a few odds and ends. I'm assuming this is for relay 10. This is awesome. As Kathy said, it's like a couple weeks away.
You're doing great. Yep, yep. Our checklist enthusiasts of the show Mike says green check mark make plan of site pages and made plan of site changes and content for site launch wrote a plan of pages and article topics. Fantastic. Well done, Mike. Um, our mountain dweller of the show.
That's an epic title. Well, again, okay. Said connection check green check mark. I invited a handful of people over for burgers on the deck, which should be about right given how much we have going on this month. Um, this is a wonderful connection and I'm so glad you got it done. Good job, Logan.
A robotics engineer of the show. Aidan says connection check green check mark. My printer is back up and running and ready to keep working on my project. Hurray. Our fish bear of the show. Guys, these are great. Fish. That's blisters. Yes. Um, okay, fish bear of the show.
Fishy guy says green square slowly getting home projects done making progress. Also, I'm sorry if I missed a pronounced your name. I, yeah. You're doing great. I appreciate you. Our entire advocate of the show, Gene Thas says connection check mostly green.
No new projects, but some current projects got expanded. Fortunately, I've negotiated it. The expanded bits can be a delayed a while. Now that right there, the alerts, the alerts. Wow. I was reading the word delayed as I was trying to say deserves. It delerves an extra like green circle there.
I'm so proud of you that you did the green circle, even if you only said mostly because you also put in that extra work to make sure that the expanded bits can be delayed and that really helps. So well done. All right. The nameless of the show says connection checks travel plans have been made.
Bookings are being done. Awesome. Again, I'm assuming that this is for a holiday. You deserve it. And our new conductor misses nameless of the show is has a green check mark because she has made her first connection. Hello, and hello. We're so happy you are here. Hooray.
If you would like to make a connection, go ahead and stay tuned. To the rest of the episode because we will walk you through how to do that when we do our new connections. But until then, we don't have a sponsor this episode, which is great because we have a lot to talk about.
And the reason I wanted Maddie to come on is because she has had some big changes going on in her life. And for those that don't know you, would you like to kind of walk through kind of what's happening, what happened, what is happening, what's actively, you know, you know how it goes. Yeah. Okay.
I have been a listener slash discord member for a really long time. So I've shared most of this in the discord. This is how you make friends guys come join us. But I was a project manager for a small software development company. And then my partner and I got pregnant.
And in February, I gave birth to a beautiful baby who has the nickname chaos with a K because you know, that's what I go by in the discord chaos with a C.
And once we had her decided I was going to become a stay at home mom quit my job and spend any of my very little free time working on becoming a published author. So it's a really big change. I knew that some of it was coming at the beginning of the year, but didn't know that all of it was coming.
You know, you can plan for having a baby, but you can't plan for everything a baby entails. Yes. Very, very true. The big changes are mostly mostly just having the baby. It's be honest like it's the biggest change of my life.
Yeah, for sure, especially when you're going from a family of two to a family of three. And that third person is basically starting as potato like they are nothing. They can't they're not, they're not, I mean, they are. Wow, they are a real human. I promise.
However, like you are responsible for everything that they do. And that's got to be, I mean, got to be, I know it is because I did it myself. It is exhausting. It is absolutely like life changing.
And that doesn't necessarily mean it's bad, but there's definitely, you know, some good and bad and all of all of the things. And it is. Yes. It's hard to like find yourself again, especially since you added in, oh, by the way, I'm not going to go back to work to that. Yes.
And it wasn't something we had planned. I planned to go back to work the entire time. And then on maternity leave, which because the United States is great was unpaid.
We realized that we didn't really need my paycheck to, you know, keep up and decided that it would be more fulfilling for our daughter if one of her parents was home. And for me, quitting my job has always been something I wanted to do for, you know, working for myself reasons.
So it made the most sense for me to be the one who to stay home, especially because my partner loves his job. So yes, that's going to make him do that. Yes. That definitely makes sense there a little bit.
You find the person that loves their job makes enough and, you know, is happy to do it versus the person that was wanting to quit their job and enjoys being with the baby. Like it's not a hard, it's not a hard decision in that case. Yeah. Yeah. That was kind of our thing too when I had mini soup.
We looked at it and we're like, well, I make more money and I don't. Joy, listen, I love hanging out with the kid, but I am not a state home parent. That is not my mindset. That's not my brain. And so it made sense like we didn't even have to have a deep conversation.
It was like, yeah, let's do this. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. So while it looks like very typical, uh, your family, it was actually like a decision we made. Not. It wasn't just like, oh, yeah, the daddy staying home now. Yeah. No, no, it was like an actual conversation we had. And I got to say, I'm loving it.
There are hard days, but it's mostly great. It's mostly wonderful. Oh, that's amazing. Yeah. What is some of your favorite parts about being a state home mom? Okay. Chaos loves to snuggle. And I mean, like, full on. She does not want to be put down if it all possible. And that is the best.
We just get to sit on the couch, read together and play with her toys. It's great. My favorite part. Amazing. Amazing. Especially since I saw on your Instagram that you found a lot of your physical to be read happened to be also in Kindle unlimited. Yeah.
So, um, I don't know if people know this, but babies are wiggly and it's really hard to hold books while you're also holding babies. It's almost like that something that I told you while you're pregnant. I think. Yeah. It is something that you told me while you were pregnant.
And I was like, no, Kathy, it's going to be fine. Everything's going to be fine. Yep. Uh, no. No, it was not fine. But I found out that, uh, on Kindle unlimited, at least 20 of my physical to be read books are, you know, in there and I can read them whenever I want.
So I downloaded them to my Kindle and now I can read even faster on the couch with my daughter. I cannot say there's enough. Um, I do read out loud to her, but they're not like, they're not age appropriate books. She really should be listening. She's not going to understand.
She doesn't know that you're reading the side changeling novels. Like that's fine. She can learn all about the shifters and the side and how it, how it, how they interact with each other and the humans and, and it's totally fine. It's only fine.
The one I was more worried about was the one that had like blood magic in it. And it was just like, maybe not appropriate for a four month old, but well, only because you don't want her to get like tainted by the magic.
Like what happens if you're reading it out loud and it like actually affects her because you never know. Isn't that the magic in ink heart? I feel like that's the magic in ink heart if you read it aloud. So that sounds familiar, but I also haven't read ink heart in a very, very long time.
So now, Erin's right. She does have to learn how to cast spells with blood eventually. That's true. That's true. It's just fast. You might as well, like you get the basic structure in place. Um, while she's still impressionable, that's a good point.
You know, then she might be more powerful in the future. Okay. So, yes. Go ahead. All of that said, you know, there are downsides being a stay at home mom slash having a baby and it is like mostly just being so tired and not having any time to just be myself.
But the biggest one, Kathy, the biggest one. And, um, friends, I have ADHD. So this, you'll understand. Um, the biggest downside is being at the whims of a creature that is not my own brain anymore. So like my brain will be like, I want to do this.
The cast is like, nope, we're doing, you know, tummy time or whatever I'm doing with the baby. That's a pain. Yeah. She's like, it's not nap time anymore. It's time. It's time to eat. You know. Um, so that is the biggest one.
It's like really hard to figure out what to do when there is a nonverbal creature yelling at you. And you're like, I don't know what you want for me. Right.
Oh, man, that's the most difficult, especially something that I learned like as they grow their cries and their concerns change because they're growing and they're, they're thinking differently.
And so you're like, okay, I know that after a happens, in 10 minutes, B is going to happen, whether it's, you know, a diaper, or whatever. But then that only works for like four days. Yeah. And then they change their routine. Yeah. Yeah.
So you can't even like mentally prep for what you knew was going to happen. Like, yeah, it's, oh my gosh, that's, yeah, that's exhausting. In good news, it will stabilize a little bit more in the future. Yeah. I'm, you know, just waiting for those days.
I'm trying not to be too like hard on myself for not getting things done because like, yeah, babies, you, if she's alive at the end of the day, everything has gone well. That's exactly what I was going to say. Listen, you are keeping another human alive.
Like that is not unimportant in many, many ways. You are keeping yourself alive too. And your dogs. So like, listen, you are succeeding. You're set. Anything else on top of it is just, you know, sprinkles. Yeah. I love sprinkles. Everyone loves sprinkles.
And if you don't love sprinkles, don't tell me because I might not trust you as a human. I know if you can hear her in the background right now, but she's losing it. If you need to take a break, I just need to pick her up and then she'll calm down. Yeah, no worries. Live show.
This was definitely something that I made sure that she knew ahead of time. That was okay because babies. It just makes it real. Like this is the real realities of life with a baby. Yeah, we're back. So Kaya's might be a little louder, but she's now on my lap and staring at the live stream chat.
Even though she can't read, everybody say hi. Hi, Kaya. We love you. Yeah. She's that's very funny. She'll send her message. I know. I love it. You know, she's on the show before my own kid. So that, you know, goals, we need to fix that. I know. I'm nervous though because they get so nervous.
Like, okay, that's fair. Recording or thing. Like, yeah, they're a little bit. If I had been doing this when they were, you know, that age, it might have worked. That was even one of the suggestions that Jay had when Jay was unhelpfully, like, suggesting guest stars.
Let's do have my kid who, you know, it's summertime, which means that they're asleep right now at 10 o'clock in the morning because that's fair. Yeah. It's summer. I'm going to be like, and so I would definitely not want to wake them up to, you know, not, not for us.
No, not for like a non live show. You could like, yeah, you have like maybe that, but not, not with the live show, not when they have no idea what this is because of course they don't listen to my shows because kids are the worst, but also the best. I don't. It's true. It's, it's, it's glorious.
I adore them and I appreciate their reality. You know, it helps bring my ego down as I need it, especially when they're like, what do you even do? That's a good question. It's a very good question. Mini soup. I'm still not sure I understand it and I've known Kathy for years now.
It's been, I'm not sure I understand it and I am someone doing it, but it's also, it depends, it depends.
Like it depends on who I'm talking to and like what, like their concentration is because if I'm talking to a dance team, well, then yeah, I'm a dance photographer and I do other things, but like this type of stuff.
It depends on the situation because people don't care that I run the oldest wheel of time community on the like, online, on the, on the internet. Like, right, unless they do.
But that's not going to be number one unless you're like, that's going to be the conversation and that's, that's, you know, it's a situational self identification, I think, which like contact switching. Yeah.
Everyone does whether they like, know it or not, is like if you're talking to, so say you're in the grocery store, you're just randomly talking to people, which I do a lot. I know not everyone does, but let's just pretend for a moment now.
So you were like me and that you will talk to inanimate objects even if you're bored and lonely.
And someone looks at you and you're, and you're talking and they're randomly will ask, you know, oh, hey, what do you do? Well, if you're there and you see that they also have kids, you would probably start with, oh, well, you know, I am a parent to a 15 year old. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And that goal of like whoever you're talking to is, is going to change like that. Yeah. No one conversation. It's like seeking a connection through like shared experiences. So if you know things about them, yeah, I get it. Yeah.
And it's not in authentic because you're still, you are who you are. Like this is still important to like you're not like this. Well, hopefully you're not like lying. Oh, yeah, I'm president of the United States or something. Like that's not necessarily what you're going to do.
But you're going to, you're going to change kind of the words that you use and the conversations that you have based on who you're talking. Definitely. And, and you know, just on that topic, vote Campbell 2024. Oh gosh, no. Let's make a president guy. No. No.
See that? But that's a problem though, is that the people that are running for president are not people that you want to be president. We should like, nicely bully people to that we think would do a good job to to run the country. Join the relay FM switch on discord.
And we will bully you into running for president. It's your, you know, I've seen Susan. And over 35 and whatever. I think there's a third requirement to, but I don't remember. I thought it was not being a felon, but I'm not sure.
Well, yeah, who knows anymore? That, that anyway, an option in the past, but that's not what the show is. No, we can, we can talk about happier stuff. Yes. Like what you're, this next topic in the topic, comment thing that you're talking about. Oh, yeah. Okay.
So one of the downsides, like I said, of being a state home mom and like having a baby is that it's really hard to find time for myself, which any parent can tell you, right? Any parent, not just moms, not just ads, like any parent can tell you that this is the hardest thing.
And I knew this was going to happen. So I know some people who listen to conduit do themes. My theme was the year of shift. So just like rolling with the punches. And one of those like things that I have shifted towards is like, my time used to be my own.
Now it is not, but my partner and I worked together to make sure we each get like self-time, you know, time to be just us, not, not to be parents. Um, and I do get that in snatches throughout the day, depending on apps and stuff.
But as I told you, when we first, you know, got on this call like sometimes chaos, it's just like, no, no, no, no, so I mean, really this is your fault for naming them chaos. Like it was, this was going to, it's, it's your fault. Do you know how many times people have told me that? Yeah.
It's accurate. Yeah. And be clear, that is not her real name, but is accurate. Okay. Chaos is not her legal name. No, I think I might have been, you know, like fine if I tried. Yeah, I think your partner might have a little, yeah. Aaron's right. We do bring it up weekly in break room. Yeah.
Like, Maddie, why did you name her chaos? I don't know. I mean, it makes sense though, because your nickname was chaos in the discord. And so you just put a K on it. So it's, it's like a relationship thing. Yeah, exactly. Oh no.
So if I don't want to know the names that you have seen as a teacher, I could imagine lots of, lots of interesting names out there, which it's not a bad thing. It's just very interesting to, to, to see and recognize and be like, huh, okay, moving on type of a thing. Yeah. Yeah.
We're all good names, Brent. That's one of my favorite internet memes of all time. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. This comment right here, so it's Tuesday of the week. I've done, I've made that comment of some sort four times since Sunday. Oh my goodness. That's like more than one a day. Oh my gosh. Yeah.
Yes. Sometimes like actual dog related, sometimes not usually not. But yeah, it's, it's great because everyone recognizes it. And if they don't, you get to share it with them, which is the best reaction experience you can experience. There's an XKCD about that. Yes. You're one of today's 10,000.
All right. All right. Yeah. So, um, when my partner and I work to get self time for each other, like right now, his focus is on he, uh, does weightlifting. So he spends a couple hours a week doing that.
Um, when I get my self time, the thing that I'm struggling with is actually using it for something other than doom scrolling. I'll just like sit in a room and I'll be like, I guess I'll just go on Instagram. No, I should stop doing that.
I want to find time to actually do things I like instead of just consuming social media. So that's one of the really hard things. Um, but yeah, uh, I'm hoping that now that I have a writing group, like I talked about in my connection, I might be able to get back into writing. Yeah.
So, so tell me about, uh, we know now some of us, uh, that your books are your life. Yes. Or a big portion of it. Yeah. Um, for anybody who doesn't know, I started a bookstagram to share my reading. Um, it's super fun.
Uh, even though the market is flooded with, um, people sharing their reading habits on Instagram, like it's a really fun community. I've made tons of friends.
Um, so it's been really fun, like talking about books that I've read that aren't popular because the algorithm is like, you know, only sharing the same five books over and over again, um, introducing people to new authors. I love it. It's so much fun.
Um, so that's one aspect of my life sharing things and reading. And the other aspect is that I'm trying to write. I'm trying to become a published novelist. So, um, that's why I started that writing group. That's hopefully going to give me some accountability.
Um, and I know Kathy knows this, but I'm assuming most of your conduit listeners don't. Uh, I finished writing an urban fantasy romance book two years ago. Its code name was Secret Seer. Uh, I sent it out to alpha readers and got a bunch of editing feedback and haven't touched it since.
So, um, this is what I want to be focusing my like self time on, you know, trying to edit, trying to, um, figure out where to go from here. Um, so yeah, but, you know, for anybody who doesn't know because you didn't alpha read it, the book is a, um, it's urban fantasy romance.
So that means it is set in a world that has some sort of magic. Um, you, urban usually indicates that it's like city based and it's not like, you know, Lord of the Ring style fantasy.
Um, this can also be called paranormal romance, you know, it's, um, like, changelings and shifters and vampires and stuff like that. Um, so it's set in the world where the gods and creatures of the world's myths, myths, like walk the earth.
Uh, the two main characters are a young trickster god and an oracle in hiding working together to solve a series of murders among the trickster followers. So, um, that is the basic, like two line summary. Uh, I had my beta readers read it. They gave me a lot of feedback.
Um, and then I just don't know where to start, Kathy. I don't know what to do.
Like, uh, have you like, not collated necessarily, but have you, like, uh, you know, have you taken, um, the feedback from the alpha readers and, like, put it together in any form, or are they just in the emails that you've received back or text or whatever, um, feedback.
I put it all in a city and document, um, all together tried to break it down by type of feedback. So, like, if it was feedback about a certain character or feedback about, um, some of the world building or the pacing of the story, I tried to, like, split it up like that.
So that, you know, I could work on one type of feedback at a time, um, but some of those are bigger than others. So, like, changing the way a character presents themselves, that's huge. So is changing pacing.
Then there were like the little things, like, uh, Maddie, your grammar was horrible in this chapter. Thanks to my grammar readers. Yes, it was horrible in that chapter. Um, so, like, I can fix the small things really easily. And even, I think I even got all of them done.
Uh, I would have to go back and check, of course, because it's been so long, but it's like the big, it's the big edits. Like, how do you go back and make sure that the ending doesn't happen too fast and wrap up too many plot threads all at once, you know, you have to add scenes.
You have to add, like, downtime and that's, that's hard. Um, so that's what I'm struggling with.
And I thought having a writing group with other people who are doing writing would help me get started on that and like get feedback from them, you know, beyond being readers, they can help me with the writing aspects too. So, yeah, really excited for that.
I think that's, yeah, I think that's a great, a great thing. It's difficult to, I can imagine, obviously, let me purpose this by saying, I'm not a reader, um, but I've been, I'm not a writer. I'm not a writer. I'm a reader. I'm not a writer. Take it back. Take it back. Take it back.
Thanks, have a good time. It's really hot. Hopefully you cannot hear the fan that I have going because that's literally the only way I would survive is with a fan running under my desk right now.
Um, but so I am not a writer, but I've, I've been alpha and beta readers for a variety of people and like helped support writers through their, that process. And I know it's, I know it's difficult to and can feel like really overwhelming.
Um, and something that one of my writer friends suggested was looking at the feedback as a whole, not as specifics, but like, you know, and I'm sure you've gathered it together. Like, hey, the pacing in this isn't, um, like, like you said, it's wrapping up to soon.
I'm looking into that and then being like, okay, here are a bunch of different ways you can change it. Not trying to find that one specific thing of like, I need to find that perfect option. Right.
But sitting back and saying, okay, if someone else was reading this or if someone else wrote this and this is mine, here are four ways that I could change it. Or suggestions.
And like, working through that because just like someone famous said, you know, that the like, the worst first draft is not having that first, like not writing it at all or something smarter sounding than that. Like, you need to, you can't edit something that you don't have.
And so you have that first in place. But now you're rewriting something because you've got to add stuff into it. Yes.
So just putting something in there that can link together will then make it easier to like make those adjustments, especially if you're changing character arcs or character presentations or personalities or something, you're going to have to go and make those changes in such a variety of places.
So like, planning out that pacing to add it. And then you can go back and like tweak what the characters will do. Yeah. Definitely. So basically like brainstorm a menu of options for each of the things I need to fix. I think that's a great idea.
And it's not something I've done because I've been basically like mulling over the changes I need to make in my brain for two years. Like one of the, one of the pieces of feedback was that the two main characters meet too early in the book.
Like, they need to be themselves first before they're a pair. And it's like, that's really good feedback. It means I need to write a bunch of new scenes though at the front of the book. And I've been brainstorming those. Haven't put a single one on paper. Haven't put a single idea down in a list.
Like, hey, maybe write this scene, this scene, this scene. And I really could. And it would make it so much easier to get started in one of those like one hour blocks I've got because I have like a specific idea to go for. And it's not going to be like brainstorm and then write an entire scene.
Right. In this one hour, you have to, you have to break it down because, and that's probably, I mean, on top of, you know, everything else that you have been going through in the last two years, like that overwhelm is scary. Like, oh, I don't even know where to start.
And I know my ADHD brain doesn't like a huge list of things. No, it's very overwhelming. Yeah, yeah, it's super scary. And so, I mean, there's, so one of the apps that was a sponsor of this show, oh my gosh, I can't even remember what it is.
But it has like this option, this like feedback for the ability to like flip through. It's called Backburner. Okay. So it has cards on it.
And you can just flip through them so you can see like, it's, you're not looking at a whole list and trying to pick from that list, but you'll only see one thing at a time. Ooh. So it might be a good idea to try something like that where you're not looking at anything, but that one card.
And if you don't want to do it yet, you can move it on. Like you can, you can swipe it and it'll go back into the stack. Yes. So it means that you're not going to get absolutely overwhelmed by all of the options when you only have this one hour.
I really love that idea and it reminds me of something I saw on Instagram. It's a creator who has been talking about how they would get like 75% of the way through a project and then stop because they were scared to finish or they like didn't know the next steps. That was too hard.
And so they set up this project for themselves where they put all of the like final steps for these myriad projects they had almost done up on a board, hid the details and had their partner pick out a pick out a card at random and they had to finish it.
And then they started keeping track of all of the good things that came out of actually finishing the project because like, you know, everybody's like talks about, oh, he was an overnight success. They were an overnight success. It's like, no, that's not true. That is not true.
You have to put in the work to finish a project and then it'll sit out there and it might not get seen by a lot of people. But then the next project will get seen by more people and then more people and then more people and then all of a sudden you've made it big.
I believe they are a screenwriter and I will I will find a link for you, Kathy, to share it in the project in the list. Oh no, there we go.
Got the word because they've been doing it for a couple months now and they're like, what's it? Like the side of the board where it says all the things that came out of, you know, doing the work.
That side of the board is filling up and they had made it small thinking, you know, not much is going to come out of finishing these tiny little projects. No, no, it's like full and they're not done with all of their post-it notes yet.
And I love that idea and I love like the focus it takes them to like just pick one card, just pick one card and just do that. And I've been thinking about could I apply this and it sounds like back burner or something like it could do that for me for my writing. Yeah.
And because it's an app and you know, say what you will, apps have their places for sure and are scary and overwhelmed. But like the fact that it's an app means you don't have to have a physical place in your house. Right. And so it's chaos won't cause chaos on it.
Yeah, she won't pull everything off of it. Yeah. Yeah. So I will check that out. Oh, bless you. Bless you. Amazing. Oh, my God. Yeah. So says someone said you wrote your book really quickly to them the other day and they laughed and laughed.
And yeah, it's it's so yeah, it's it's difficult because people don't see what they don't see. Right. There's nothing wrong with that.
And it's it's part of like a not a job necessarily, but like a way to support people that are that care about you to help give them information like to support their journey in learning the way that they need to and want to learn.
So being able to like really like, Oh, yeah, I get you think I can see. See how you could imagine this book being written easily and quite however, let me give you the truth. Like that is not how it works. And I have fallen guilt or fallen victim to that mindset too. I'm sure you have as well.
Like even as a writer, I'll be like reading. Okay. Here's a good example. Nora Roberts puts out like three books a year. Woman is a legend. And so it's like your brain thinks, Oh, she puts them out so fast. Like it must not be that much effort to write her books. Like I could probably do that.
No, the reason she puts out three a year is because she's working like an insane person and has been for years and years like just just wild. Yeah. How even knowing the behind the scenes of what goes into writing a book, our brains can trick us and be like, this should be easy.
It should be like you should be successful right now. Well, it doesn't help that you see people like Brandon Sanderson who come out and they're like, Oh, by the way, here's a bajillion novels that I just wrote overnight. But his brain works differently too. Yes. And that's okay.
You can't compare yourself to that. Instead, you got to compare yourself to yourself and like what are you able to do? But also like Nora Roberts has that, oh my gosh, what's it called? Like a structure she has the like the scaffolding like all the people around her to help her do stuff. Yes.
Exactly. So she's not expected to keep house and keep a child alive and make dinner every day. And all of these things on top of it, like she's sitting there and then it also helps that her books are fairly formalic, which is not a bad thing. And that's like, Oh, well, this is really predictive.
Like, okay. So like I guess to the killer was good for you. But guess what? A lot of times all people want is to have a scapegoat. A scapegoat is him. Yes. Yeah. I'm a professional podcast. Yes. A scapegoat is him. Yes. Yes.
And being able to like take that moment of like enjoying something that yes, you know how it's going to end. You know, and that there is nothing wrong with that. There is a reason that she has been able to write so many books.
And that's because she's, you know, is able to focus in on here's what her readers want. Here's what her readers like. And guess what? That's great. Yeah. And like, she's probably not going to win what's like the awards for like, um, Nebula awards for like, sci-fi.
And I was thinking of like a Pulitzer prize. It's not a good one. That's a good one. It's not a Pulitzer Prize winning book. And guess what? That is okay. Yeah. It's not the point. It's really not the point of her books. Yes. What was I going to say? Oh, like, nope. I lost it. Sorry. Okay.
Pulitzer Prize is not the point of a romance novel. No, I lost it. I really lost it. Okay. Is it, you know, romance novels want the happily ever after? Yes. That's what it was. Yeah. Yes. Okay. Like, yeah. Here we go. Here we go. You got it.
The point of romance is not to win prizes like the Pulitzer. It's to give your readers the happily ever after. They're really like, we know what's coming and we know it's going to end well. Like, this is actually the definition of a romance novel.
It's not a romance novel unless the two characters who are the main characters or three, you know, or four polyrelationships are becoming a thing in romance, which is amazing. I love it. They need to get together at the end and they need to be happy and they need to be happy forever more.
That is how a romance is defined. I think famously Nicholas Sparks who writes what would be considered romantic fiction says his or not romance is they are love stories because he does not guarantee a happy ending. And in fact, most of the time his books end horribly and you're weeping.
So slowly heartbreaking. Yes. Oh, God. It's been a while since I've had like any desire to read a book that does not end happily. Like even in fantasy and sci-fi, like those things for me need to have a happily ever after as well, even if it comes after seven books.
Like those people need to survive. They need to survive and they need to be in a better world by the end of that. Yeah. So yeah, I think it's it's it's so difficult to acknowledge that sometimes like being able to recognize. Like yeah, this is okay. This is what I want. This is what I want to read.
And the same thing along with like people being ashamed of like what they're reading, you know, I'm talking about, oh, I read all of these self-help books or I'm reading, you know, the 10,000 page novel of, I don't know, someone famous from, you know, the third century. I don't even know.
I don't even know. I like here's a memoir is a Marcus Aurelius. Like, okay, cool. If that's really what you want to read, absolutely congratulations, fantastic. I'm so happy for you. Yes. However, however, there's no judgment in what you're reading if you want to have fun.
If you want to enjoy what you're reading, enjoy it. For a lot of people, that's what reading is. And it's not, it's not for, you know, education purposes for others it is.
Like, there's someone in the discord who is constantly sharing like really in depth nonfiction books they're reading and more power to them. I could not do that. I could not do that. But for them, that's fun, which is great. For me, it would not be fun. It would be exhausting.
Yeah, let's know why it's reading what you want to read. Yes. I'm being happy with that and not trying to force somebody else to read what you think that they should read unless they're asking for opinions or options, then you can. That's fine. But like, let's not, yeah. It's, it's rough.
It is rough. And actually, I ranted about this on my stories on Instagram the other day because this is a very specific example. But I don't know if people have heard of Colleen Hoover, but she is a famous author. She has written dozens of books at this point, I think, like maybe two dozen.
And she gets like a weird amount of hate from certain sections of the book reading population. Just like people judge her books without even reading them.
The other day, I saw someone post a reel that was like, the day I have a Colleen Hoover book on my bookshelf is the day I don't deserve a bookshelf.
And I was like, who are you to judge? Why are you doing this? Why are you so mad about someone who is not in any way harming you? And it's just, so let's just normalize. Everyone can read whatever they want.
The only time I will give you hate for reading an author is if they're actively harming someone. Yeah. Because there are authors who are doing that.
One, and there is something to, you know, Colleen Hoover's books do tend to have like feature some abusive and like harmful relationships that are not that are very toxic. Yeah.
Which is like, yes, that's, but if somebody is reading them and enjoying them and no, like I think as long as like can acknowledge the fact that like why it's problematic. Sometimes that could be okay.
But also like, if you need to help somebody like, hey, just so you know Colleen Hoover, very problematic because of XYZ. And then they can make the decision, that choice.
But as Joshua says, yes, everyone is legally required if you're listening to my voice right now to purchase Maddie's book when it comes out. Just kidding. But also, you know, let's support it.
Let's support our friends, let's support people we love and know there's a lot of times that I will buy a book. And it's still on my list to read. And I haven't read it yet. And okay, guess if that's okay too. Hi, Kate. That is very okay. She just wanted me to tell you that that happens to me too.
I counted my TBR the other day. And it's in the 600s. Kathy. Oh my God. See, here's, that's what you do what I do where you just don't count and you don't keep track of it. They just live in your Kindle.
And then, you know, if you, I found, let's see, I was trying to figure out what I wanted to read like six months ago. And I was like, okay, let me go through the not downloaded section of my Kindle.
And I was like, oh, I totally forgot about this book that I bought for a friend, like from a friend like three, four years ago. And so I read it. And guess what? It was great. And I sent a message to them. I just, you know, I finally read your book, I love it.
Here's why, you know, give me that, that hopeful supportive, like, yay, good job. Type of a thing. Yeah, for the record, I don't love that I counted my, my TBR numbers either. Like, I didn't want to know that. Now I can do calculations. Yeah. Yeah.
I can do calculations on how long it's going to take me to get through that list or I don't want to know. Yeah. Yeah. No. Because here's the thing is it's, it's literally impossible to read everything that's ever been written. Right. It's impossible. And so read what you want to read.
I just need to stop buying books until I have, you know, time to eat them. You have your friends and stuff that you want to support. Okay. That is an exception, but like, you know, I don't need to buy the newest bestseller right now if I'm not going to read it for four years. That's true.
Especially if you're going to get a physical book when you can get an in-paper back. Yeah. All right. Clearance on sale from the library. So many options. So many options for reading. Yes. Barrow it from a, steal it from a friend. You might not be allowed in my library, Kathy.
Don't you? I condom steal it. Condom stealing. I'm just kidding. I'm stealing. Oh my god. Yeah. I keep, I'll go to the bookstore and I'll be like, oh, this looks good. This looks good. This looks good. And that I'm like, but I can't buy the physical book because I literally will never read it.
So often I'm reading at night in bed and it's really hard for me to lay down and hold the book open. And yeah, it's, it's just not real books are not not my life. Whereas if I did not have a wriggling, you know, wriggling child in my arm, they would be my preferred way to read. Yeah.
Which is also fine. They're all good books. And so is audio books. I can't really do audio books unless it's a series that I've read a lot of times just because of how my brain like takes the information in. It's not super great. That's okay. I do, you know, I deal with it.
How I can and yet see, Justin comes in here and makes the they're good. They're all good jokes. They're all good books, brand, except I already made that joke today on this podcast. So snail to you. We bring it all background. Kathy. Yes. Yes. Yes. Oh goodness. Yes. Yes.
I used to be a big audio person, an audio book person. And I think that was because I was also a podcast person and more a podcast person than an audio book person. Because I discovered that I can't get into a book unless I physically cannot get distracted for the first like hour. Ha ha ha. Ha.
I wonder why that's more difficult for you to to discover. I don't know. I don't know. Could be, could be the currently screaming daughter on my lap. No, that could be it. Yeah. No, definitely not.
Is there anything else you want to cover before? I don't think so because I think chaos is saying we need to end mom. Yeah. Yeah. That's kind of the vibe I was getting.
So what is your connection for the next season?
What we talked about earlier, I think I'm going to focus on making the plan for editing secrets here by creating those little lists for, you know, like the little brain storm lists for each edit I need to make like one for pacing, one for characterizations, stuff like that.
So that in my self time, I can start to actually do edits. So yeah, that's going to be my connection for the next two weeks. So I will put it in the feedback channel for the next conduit. Love that.
Well, kind of along this same line of, you know, books and beta readers and all of that, I need to finish and send the feedback for my friend Antony's book and that needs to happen ASAP. So that is going to be my concentration goal.
And then I also want to read it at their time to like not for feedback, but just for fun to go in and really cause chaos in it because it's an incredible idea. And I cannot wait for it to come out because it's going to be amazing. So excited.
And for our connectors, our Carl of all trades at the show Carl says their new connection is to email the date to host the art with code event probably after the trip to Colorado. And I need to finish up the agenda and slide deck. Yes, I'm so excited and I'm so excited, so excited for you.
