From RelayFM, you're listening to Conduit, the show where we condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that will cough nearly to expiration. This episode is brought to you by Claude. I'm Jay and with me is the internet's busyness unicorn, Kathy Campbell.
Oh, that's me. Hi. That's you. We haven't talked to each other in like two weeks because I've been gone, you've been gone. I've been gone. Everybody's been gone. Everybody's been gone. I was gone so hard that I only had access to iMessage. Wow. Yeah.
And also, except for the fact that my phone would send me like notifications and I'd get previews, but I couldn't reply. So I would get like slack notifications when we beat the goal of $700,000 raised for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, which was incredible. Right.
But I couldn't like say congratulations. So instead I texted Steven like, yay. You're like, congrats personally, Steven, who all the money is going to. Just kidding. No, no, no. There was a part of me that was like because he has to print out a big giant check. No. To the people at all sack.
But I was like, that's not how that works. Nope. It is not. Cool. I was gone. I was in New York City. New York City. I was staying right on Times Square. I'm so sorry. I mean, so funny enough, my hotel, very cool hotel. I stayed at the motto. Where the motto are you? Oh, my God. Sorry. Oh, my God.
No, I'm not. I'm not sorry at all. You're welcome. It was the first time where like you had to you basically had to put on an iPad like or a tablet screen, touch screen or whatever, like what floor you were going to and then scan. And then it would tell you what elevator to step in. Oh.
To that floor. But there were no buttons inside the elevator except for like the emergency ones. That's how the elevators at St. Jude are. You push the button outside before you get in the elevator and it goes up. I think it's to prevent people from like just pushing a bunch of buttons and. Yeah.
Yeah. Trying to sneak onto floors that they don't belong on. Yeah. But yeah, it was it was a very interesting time. I got to I got to eat at a very cool Nigerian restaurant. Shout out to Lagos NYC. I got to eat. Trace Leches for the first time, which was all my using. You've never had it.
Oh, I never had Trace Leches. So that was my first time. And then I got to celebrate my birthday when I got home with my one of my friends. Like he's a part of our game night crew, but he used to work at a bakery and he always agrees to. To make the cake, the birthday cake.
Like that's his present is he makes. Oh, and he made a cake for me. And I was like, yes. Oh, amazing. I got all the Trace Leches. I got those Trace Leches. It's not how it works. But yes. And then we ate really good Peruvian food. Yeah, it was amazing. It was amazing.
So like my last week has been fantastic. I'm on cloud nine. I'm in my I'm in my like thinking of others era. Like I had a theme, if I had a system in which I lived by a particular theme, it would probably be something like thinking of others.
But naturally, I don't do that because I'm going to get that by Tuesday. Yep. And that's OK. Speaking of Tuesday, we kind of just talked about all the things that we did in the last couple of weeks. I mean, you did. Well, no, you talked about the same June, the celebration. A little bit. Yeah.
Hey, Kathy, what did we do in the discord? That isn't what you said that we did while you were on the cruise. Yes. So there was a lot of celebration because the campaign ended yesterday as we record this.
October 6th was the ending and we ended over $750,000 raise, which makes us the third highest amount that we've raised for St. Jude, which in this economy is absolutely incredible. Our community by far is the best.
And one of my favorite things is the rewards that get sent out and that are shared in the discord. And we had an incredible member in the discord whose campaign made little drawings and then physically sent those drawings out.
And they've been showing up and being shared on the in the discord, which has just been an absolute delight. So I highly recommend if you are a member of any show on relay joining the discord because it is fantastic. And we have some fun things coming for November in the discord.
And we have a spoiler alert for our thankfulness season. So stay tuned. Thankfulness season. Yeah. And then again, like because both Kathy and I were traveling and away and doing things, there was no co-working. We're going to bring it back.
Kathy, I've actually been supplementing my co-working with co-working, but co-working with some friends and a lovely like tech, like a tight knit tech friends community that has a couple of folks that like to body double.
So even though I don't get to hang out with y'all nearly as much on Tuesdays because of all the travel, like when I am at my desk as I am now, almost on a daily basis, there's like a 30 minute like chat with friends, get a little bit of work done, see how things are going.
And then it's, it's been very, very nice. That's awesome. That's awesome. And lovely listeners, you can do that with us every other Tuesday when we're not traveling for an hour. That's twice the fun. You can go to I'm a super conductor dot com, become a member today.
Letter I, letter M, letter A, super conductor dot com. Sorry, I was getting in my dance thing. Hey, Kathy, what was one good thing? Yeah, I, my one good thing for this episode is the fact that Disney cruises are amazing. I cannot even begin to state how incredible. I love details.
I love the details that Disney puts in things. They're very similar to details that St. Jude puts in things, but obviously a little bit different. But this was the oldest ship. It launched in 1998, which was the last year that I had been on a cruise.
And so it was really exciting to be on this boat that launched that I had wanted to go to when I was younger and being able to be on the cruise. And the people were 90 percent incredible. There were a couple situations that I had to, like, make notes of, and that's fine.
But I spent so much time at the Soul Cat Lounge, which is themed around the movie Soul. And in case it played jazz music and they had, like, live jazz. And it was just incredible. The bartenders there were, became some of my besties.
Like, I just sat and read most of the trip, except for when I read in portholes, which was great. But, yeah, it just was amazing. And I am looking forward to another cruise in the future sometime. Maybe. Hopefully, someday soon. That sounds like a lot of fun.
For my, let's see, for my, I don't want to talk about my birthday again, because, again, like, my only thing was my birthday. But during my birthday, in which we ate Peruvian food, I had sucuereres, which was so good. And we had, I forgot what they were called.
They're like these fries, but they're not made out of potato. They're made out of a Peruvian starch of sorts. Okay. I cannot remember the name of it. I wanted to say papaya, but I was like, I know that is not the right answer. Okay. Shout out to the freaking Incan.
That was the name of the restaurant. Amazing. Amazing. And if I can find their menu, I will tell you what I had, because it was so good. But it was a good time. It was a good time with friends. And everyone that was, everyone was like, this is absolutely amazing.
How did we never come here before? This is like the new place to place. They have adults. They have a Trace Leches cake. Oh, hey. On their menu. So I could have had Trace Trace Leches. But no, that would have been way too much. That would have been too much. Yeah. I don't know what they are.
I give up. That's okay. Oh, they were yucca. They were yucca fritas. Oh, yum. Thank you, chatters. Also nameless. Yes, you're correct. Also fishy guy. You're correct. And we had, yes, all the fried plantains. They were great. Yes, so Trace Trace Leches. Not very yucky yucca.
In fact, it was delicioso very much. And the platanos were absolutely amazing. So, yes, very good thing indeed was the food. It was so good. I ate it. Now it's time for the connection check. Sam. Kathy, you mentioned reading in portholes. Yes, yes.
They had these incredible like lounge areas to like lay down in. It was so cozy and fantastic. My connection was to finish reading a physical book.
That became more difficult because what I would do is I had my little bag that had my Kindle on in it and I would just like go places, read, and then I'd move somebody somewhere else and read. And basically, I made the mistake of bringing really thick books, thick with two C's, which was fantastic.
And I did start reading it, but I quickly learned that it was not very sustainable to read the big book. But I did finish five books on my Kindle. So there's that. So I gave myself an orange circle instead of like saying no, because I did try and it just was not as successful as I would have liked.
Because I kept moving around into cozy places and it was fantastic. I love that. Also, like shout out to the different environments in which reading can take place. Yes, yes. That's something that I really, really enjoyed.
So some people might think, hey, Kathy, a Disney cruise, that sounds like a lot of children. Yes. Yes, it would. However, the good part is, is that there were places that I could hide from.
And I could also like just move around, which was great because by moving around, I could just go where there were not a lot of children at times.
The quote unquote adults only spaces were not as adults only, but at least most of the people that went into the adults only spaces with their children were apologetic, like they were just passing through or whatever. And as they should be. Yes, yes. Yeah. And but overall, it worked out.
It worked out really well. I love it. We're living our best lives now. Yes. Um, let's see. My connection was to get the information that my team needs. I had a meeting this morning in which my boss reminded me that I was I specifically said I am going to this place to get this information. Oh, no.
And you did not. No, I. I. I. I came up with it. I came up with an answer. I mean, that is that is a choice that. Yes. You know, it was. I wouldn't say that. I wouldn't say I didn't have a fly like that. I had like a flyer on me that was like, I need this answer. I need this information today.
Hey, if you are this person, come reach out to me. But I definitely did talk to a couple of people about like, hey, doing work with us. I know you've done it in the past. Like, would you be open to doing it again? And so and so.
Like, so I kind of like I kind of did it, but I didn't like I didn't like go all in with the conviction that I I wanted to. But OK, because I definitely reached out to my colleague who's going to Latvia with me and we're going to we're going to prioritize that. OK, so good.
So you've got you didn't necessarily do the thing, but you laid a foundation in place to be able to get the thing done that needed to be done with support. Yeah.
And the thing that I'm I was kind of leaning on, the reason I gave myself a little bit of credit is just as I'm going back and thinking about all the people that I talked to and like all the different conversations that I had, like the answer is probably I wouldn't have found anyone anyway.
But I didn't like specifically like ask of the thing. So there's OK, there's like this. I don't want to go back and like retcon and be like, I did a good job on this.
But I want to say, like, I was very like cognizant of trying to keep trying to think about the interactions that I was having with people. And there I just didn't have any interactions with people that like felt like they were going to be of the value that that we were looking for. Gotcha.
OK, that makes sense. Yeah. Amazing. What about our conductorinos? Yeah, our conductorinos are fabulous. Aaron, our identical twin of the show, says Green Circle. Been keeping up with my physio exercises and also had a lovely vacation. Even got to meet up with the lovely Pillix and Mrs.
Pillix for dinner while in Quebec. Amazing. Magnific. Love that. Yeah. Our profane sleeper of the show, Mike, said we have had things get very bad and very scary very fast today. Oh, no.
Most likely while the show is being recorded and we'll know the extent of what's going on with some potential options for treatment. Cancer can go F right off. You know what? I endorse that message. Yeah. But I'm also very, very sorry to hear that you're going through some very difficult stuff.
Yeah. I'm sorry that we that I wasn't in the discord when this all came through. And thank you for sharing. And please feel free to have this be a space to, you know, work through whatever you need to. Obviously, I'm sure you have a community anywhere, but we're we're here for you as well.
And yes, cancer can F off. Our doll of the show, Molly, says Green Heart made a solid plan for going to the library four days a week and been sticking to it. That's amazing. Well done. Shout out to the libraries. Our tech podcast listener of the show, Pillock, says question mark. I don't know.
I don't remember. Yeah, that's OK. You're back. You're back on track. Back on track. Our soprano of the show, Debo, says connection check. Green Heart wrote my blurb for the class report book for next summer's 25 year college reunion. Amazing. Good job. Our ah of the show. Hold on.
I have a dentist appointment soon. So ah. Says green, not green, yellow. That's yellow. Yellow square. My September was a combination of illness and nonstop chaos. I don't remember what my connection was. The 21st day of September. But almost certainly didn't do it. Or any other days around it.
Ah, sadly. That's OK, though. I'm glad you're feeling better. Yeah. Definitely glad you're feeling better. Yep. And welcome back. Our fish bear of the show, Fishy Kai, says connection check. Yellow circle. Didn't get people scheduled, but got a few quotes.
Jay, concrete lifting is pumping stable foam under a concrete pad to lift it, usually because it has sunk due to erosion. I mean. Thumbs up. Yeah. I'm glad. I'm glad we now both know how to lift concrete. You know. Yep. I knew that the whole time. Oh, yeah. Absolutely.
I'm so glad that we have this written down so that everyone else can know how to do it. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Our robotics engineer of the show says connection check. So far, practicing has gone well. Singing. Singing note. So far, practicing has gone well. Let's see if I keep it up this week.
I'm guessing music note. So if I remember correctly, you're trying to learn how to play the clarinet. Maybe. Some, some, some. A musical instrument. Maybe your voice. It's, we're not sure anymore. Time is weird. Yeah. But my memory is faulty.
The Esperanto knitter of the show, Irizano, says green check mark. Clearly rested because I finally got my steno keyboard out after two months to start learning steno. I dove in six days ago and got to 19 words per minute on a test this morning. A lot better than I expected. Okay.
So I saw this when it came through and I am so intrigued because steno is something that always blows my mind.
I've seen a couple times like it'll come up in, I think it was like a criminal minds episode where the murdered victim like was a stenographer and everyone uses their own little codes and like trying to translate it. And I, it's just fascinating.
And so I hope you will continue to share your journey with us because this is incredible. I'm so excited for you. Yes, yes, yes. My favorite steno keyboard is the caracorder, but I can't use it because I write code and then I would have to basically like rewrite everything.
But, oh, they're so cool. They're very, very cool. Our checklist enthusiast of the show, Mike, says check mark, clean up the task backlog. I got a bunch of stuff done for my backlog. I scheduled others and deleted some tasks that are no longer needed. Oh, that's just clean, clean, clean.
So refreshing. Our Swifty of the show, Andrew says, huh? It's been too long, so I don't remember. But I've been doing and accomplishing a lot. And that's what is really important that you are doing the things even if you don't necessarily know what it is.
But also, no comment on Life of a Showgirl, new Taylor Swift. How did you read my mind? Yeah, because I knew where you were going. I knew where you were going. Yeah, I'm fascinated to know what you think. And, Jay, maybe we'll leave that for the after show to talk about it if you have thoughts.
Yeah, I'm sure you have thoughts. Yeah, number one thought. I don't care. Yeah. Wow. Shocking. Hey, this episode is brought to you by this episode of Conduit is brought to you by Claude from Anthropic.

If I go through my Claude history right now, let's see. The last several things that I talked about were helping me write policy changes for my nonprofit, as well as I'm trying to find some plant stuff in here. I ask a lot about plants and usually it's like you're killing them. Yeah.
It's like you're probably doing this. Great example. I said, what do curling leaf tips usually mean? This is how house plants. And it says, you know, it could be low humidity, watering issues, too much direct sun or temperature stress. And I was like, OK, but it's for my alocasia.
And they were like, it's probably humidity changes. And in fact, the humidity has changed that they need the humidity around 60 percent. And the soil dries out slightly between watering. So you've been mixing them and checking to see if the soil stays soggy.
And it was like, oh, yeah, you probably water over watered it a little bit. And then just just just relax. It'll be fine. Just let it dry out. It'll be fine. It'll be good. And you know what? I'm glad I'm glad that Claude was there to be like, hey, you're doing a lot right now.
Maybe you need to calm down. Yeah. Like, let's let's relax a little bit. So, yeah, I use Claude for a bunch of different things because Claude is the AI for minds that don't stop, period. And then also they don't stop it good enough.

Our thanks to Claude for their support of this show and all of Relay. Thanks. So, Kathy, you had a topic. I did have a topic. I'm excited for this topic. I'm so glad. So my idea for this topic is basically, so at when I was at St.
Jude with some other wonderful hosts for the podcast-a-thon, I had a deep thought about some of my co-hosts and the skills that they bring. So, for example, Jason is a master at balancing professionalism with silliness.
He would be doing, you know, a present, like talking about, you know, something serious, but doing it with a hat on his silly hat.
And just the way he kind of presented himself was warm and opening, but still got the work done, which makes sense because, you know, he's been doing this for a long time. But it's a skill that I wish I had.
I tend to go too silly and need to reel it back, but I get so excited about things that I just kind of lose it a little bit.
And then I also have a friend who he is so good at concentrating on whoever's talking in a way that even if he feels extremely uncomfortable, he's very introverted and will be in a big group of people.
And yet he still is managing to be connected, even if he's nervous, even if he's like, I would rather go lay down, you know, be cozy in my house and not talk to anybody. But he still manages to ask the questions and engage with people in a way that like breaks through his nerves.
And this just kind of got me thinking about like these skills in life that some people seem to have it so easy that it just comes to them.
It's it's it's it's simple for them to be able to be this type of a person, whereas it could be that they are working really hard at it and then also want to kind of recognize and reflect on things that we're really good at. And yeah, so that was kind of kind of my impetus of this topic. I like it.
I. You mentioned being a good listener, and that is just the thing I suck at. I'm so bad at it. Exactly. It. I think that there is and. Maybe it's just as as we grow up, have kids, things like that, you see.
I see myself so much in like my kiddo when I'm trying to get her attention and she's just like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever you said. But focus on like my thing now. It's funny because Brittany like mentioned that I do the same thing. And I'm pretty sure we have talked about this video before.
But the like autism, the autism spectrum explained by ducks has like such a great like example of that where it's like duck gets excited about slugs. Duck thinks about slugs all day and night. People want to talk about other thing. Duck says, yeah, but them slugs, though.
And that that is very much I definitely catch myself being in the moment of, OK, will you stop talking so I can share the exciting thing that I want to talk about? And and again, like I don't. I don't necessarily one like don't do that. That's that's rude. That's being a jerk. Don't be a jerk.
But also like having people in your life that are strong listeners and are able to connect the strands of a conversation, you know, across a long length of time. That is it. It is. Such a fantastic trait to have. That I clearly don't. So I would I would second that with you.
The other thing, the things that I was thinking about when you talked about this, we had this example in the pre-show where there was like. Jay, make a choice. And I had to choose A or B. And I sat there and I was like, but what about C, though? And you're like, there is no C. It's A or B.
It's like, well, what if I took pieces of A and pieces of like pick A or B like. Just pick one. Concrete decisions, especially concrete decisions that have zero impact. Those are the hard ones. The ones that I'm like, well, if I do this, I'll die like that. Like riding a motorcycle, no helmet on.
That sounds like a terrible idea. You know, like that. Those are the easy decisions. Do I want to do I want to go stay at the haunted house or go stay at the hotel? Neither. I want to stay in my bed. So those those are so easy to make.
But when it's just like, do you like this shirt or this shirt? I will be there for an hour. OK, Chidi. Oh, was that a was that a thing that you. No, no, no, no, no. That's that's a thing that you haven't seen the good place because you don't watch good television, which is fine.
That's that's something that Chidi from the good place. Part of the reason that he went to the bad place was because of decision making. And so I kind of love that. That's very you are Chidi. Hmm. I guess I guess Chidi I am. The the thing that's really interesting about this is.
seeing other people work and this ties into maybe a little bit of neurodivergence conversation. I don't know if I'm not normal or not. And a part of that is I hang out with a bunch of weirdos like like, Kathy, you're a weirdo.
You have a business where you help people on over the Internet, like 90 percent of my friends I have never seen in real life or I see maybe like once a year in real life. And it's it's not it doesn't impact our friendship in any negative way.
It's we just live our lives and then we come back and we are in each other's lives for the time that we're there and then we leave and we exit each other's life. And that's that's just kind of it. But I like I have a small friend group here and they're like always around.
And I we hang out like we meet and hang out at the bus stop. We hang out during game nights and stuff like that. So it's very much like, oh, y'all aren't going to just randomly disappear for six months. This is weird.
I don't I don't know how I feel about permanent friends like I don't have enough to talk about to keep permanent friends. Oh, yeah. Engaged. Yeah, I have I have a friend who has a life. Like, I don't I don't know what the word like concept for life.
And it's this idea of sweet spots where there's some people that you can talk to every day and never run out of things to talk about. There are some people that you see once a year. And that is still it's still difficult to keep those connections.
There's there's, you know, everyone in the middle and it's different for everybody. It can also change constantly. And I think it's something it's something that I'm trying to actually put into more active thought in my life because it just makes sense. There's some people that are exhausting.
We love them. We still want them in our lives, but maybe at a limited rate. That were exhausting. Yeah. Listen, there's a reason that this show is fortnightly. I'm exhausted. Dead and exhausting. So exactly. But I still adore you. And I love this show.
And I love being able to sit and talk to you about things. And but that is is something for friends that that's really good. I have there's people. It blows my mind. I have another friend who talks to their mentor from college every week for multiple hours on the phone. That's gross.
And I'm just like, get off the phone. What? What? I don't I do not understand. I do not get it. And that's OK. I don't have to because I don't have that in my life. Oh, no. Like, I don't even call and talk to my mom. Like, we'll text occasionally.
But when she calls, it's because there's something that's needed. Like, we'll sit and we'll talk in person. I went over on Sunday and help them find flights for a trip. But like, we don't. We don't just sit and talk on the phone and people that can talk on the phone. Mad skills.
I'm very impressed with that. I get so distracted because it's audio only. And I I'm like, OK, I'm going to go do the dishes while I'm talking or whatever. And yeah, it's not it's not a skill I have. And it's also not one that I really want to get better at either.
I think that's the the biggest thing is that, like, some of these skills I have no desire in having. Like, I don't want. I don't want to hold a conversation for an hour. I barely want to talk about myself for an hour. I don't want to talk about myself for an hour.
I think it's interesting that even in our skill sets, like. I can get up on stage and give a talk. And when we talk about, like, the things that we are we are good at, particularly good at. I have an anecdote about that.
But like, I can I can present to people, even though I'm like, I don't think I am the best person at presenting well thought out, researched topics. You want me to riff? You want me to be a comedian for 30 minutes? Fine. Great. Awesome.
You want me to hold context about this thing and why it's important and why this person spent this much energy and effort on it? I'm sorry. I'm just I'm I'm going to call them that name that did thing like that's I don't know how to prepare. I don't know how to do prepared things.
I would argue that that is false since that's literally part of your job and you do it well. But it's not, though. Like, here's the thing. Conduit. How many times have we come to Conduit or the day of or the day before and been like, what are we going to talk about? OK, OK, OK.
No, but I'm talking about these. You get called to go to speak to conferences and I have to prep for that. No, I pull it out of my butt every time. But you know what you're going to talk about when you go, right? I I have an idea.
I put some slides together and then like a week before, like a week before when I've had months to formulate a plan, a spark of inspiration pops up and I completely redesign everything that I was going to say to tell a story.
And then I get up on stage and I tell the story and it hasn't failed me yet, except for the times it has where that story was like true. True. Being able to get up and like jazz my way through a technical topic is definitely a skill.
However, I envy so much the folks that are like I watched five conference talks. My slides have 50 lines of comments in them and I can speak to this thing with all of the confidence and education that I've earned. For me, it's like words are hard. Tech is harder.
But if you do this, you might just win. Ka-chow. And I mean, OK, I would argue, though, that you're really good at like the writing type thing, too, because you write the descriptions for the show. It would take me so long to do that. I see that I can. I think that that's where like.
Hire like talking like job stuff, like hiring to cover weaknesses. Yeah. Instead of like just doubling down on strengths, I think I've always been a fan of doing that. I and again, to the people in chat that are saying like, no, that's a skill. I recognize that's a skill.
But what I'm saying is, is there is a level of anxiety and stress that comes from that skill that I would I would give up in a heartbeat because. Like, OK, primary example in New York, I gave a talk.
I literally found out the day before the answer to the question that I was going to pose in my talk. And it fundamentally changed how I presented to where it was like, OK, there's foreshadowing.
I'm going to tell this story and then we're going to get to the big moment and I'm going to reveal like the culprit. And then we're all going to laugh and have a good time.
But at the end of the day, can I tell you down to a technological, like a fundamental, like technology set up of how this thing worked? No, because every time I tried to, I got bored and I checked out. And yet you're still able to go and do it.
So I know you're saying that it's yeah, you wish that it was otherwise. And that's OK, too. But the fact that you are able to do it on such a like quick processing thing is is impressive. And so own it a little bit. Yeah. Well, and like if let's let's transition to like the things we do good.
Yeah, I can last minute like like no one else. You need a video yesterday. I got you. You need a video tomorrow. Don't even ask me until tomorrow.
Like I have also while in New York, we had one of the people who was supposed to give a talk backed out and they were like, hey, do you have another talk that you can give? And I was like, well, I can, but I'm at work and I don't have like a work related one. We could just make one.
And they were like, you're going to make a talk that you have to give in less than 24 hours. And I was like, yes, people are doing backflips and celebration for this talk that I made or that I made with the help of one of my colleagues. Shout out to Maya. You were awesome.
Like we were able to get a talk done in 24 hours and everyone was like, I'm sorry at how stressful that was. And I was like, it's done now. We've we've got this.
We've now got this new piece of content that we've created out of thin air that we have we have built from the ground up, utilizing all the resources around us. Like that is a massive accomplishment that I'm so excited that I am capable of doing.
But also, I just want to highlight I was up until almost 2 a.m. working on this stuff. So like there's there is a very. There's like if every time I did the trick, I was slowly like taking minutes off of my life.
Like, yes, I can do the trick, but I probably shouldn't try to do that trick all that often. Yeah. No, but you can still do it in a way that's pretty fantastic. That's also why I have like five videos due by the end of the week, but we're not going to talk about that. No, that's fine.
But I just found out about those today. So like they understood the assignment. They were like, hey, so you're going to do that social media? Hey, I was like, yeah, I'll have it to you by Thursday. And I was like, as I was saying, it was like, no, no. Don't tell them Thursday. So here I am.
Love it. I love it. Yeah. I wish I had the ability to remember people's faces better, too. Or like tangentially things. But what I have a skill that I have worked really good at to cover this is being able to keep things. Generic enough until I remember.
So I was with a friend and we were talking to a third person. We probably talked for maybe a good 45 minutes and left. And then that other person left. And I turned to my my friend turned to me and she goes, who was that? I'm like, no idea. I thought you knew. I thought you listen.
I'm just going to sit. I'm going to BS my way through this and hope that they have had an engaging conversation and slip things in there when I can. But yeah, no idea. No idea. You also have. I mean, like you have to have this with the jobs that you do.
Like you have the ability to do things that are not. Flashy. And and you give like. It is a such a big deal for other people, like to be able to help them through email, help them get tax information together.
Like, again, I'm like two minutes into this and I'm asleep at the table, like giving up on life. And like you are talented enough that like you do 90 percent, if not 100 percent sometimes of the show note prep. You handle all of the sponsor stuff. You make sure that we both get paid.
You make sure that everybody else in Relay gets paid. You on top of all of that, run a business, which comes with business running problems. You manage the lives of or the business lives of several executives like there are you. You can. Put a lot on your plate and seem to just run it.
your part of your companies watching. Whereas like most people I know, myself included, if we tried half of what you were doing, the context alone would bury us.
 yeah and I wish it wasn't something that that that's a skill that I had to learn I feel like I was not nearly as good at it before my spouse's stroke that definitely compartmentalization was kind of a survival tactic on top of being a caretaker like on top of being like a parent and a caretaker and a spouse like that's you make me sick with your effectiveness yeah it's it's a skill I had to learn though it's it's it's something that unfortunately I've done a lot of practicing on and and in order to protect myself which means when I get into a space that I'm not either not able to or I shouldn't be compartmentalizing um I don't I kind of flounder a lot um and and that's uncomfortable for me but I am I'm I'm working in these uncomfortable spaces to try and be better at it and I think that's that's helping the the the ability to self-identify what you're good at and what you're you have challenges with I think is a skill that everyone should work on being able to acknowledge these you know not negatives um but these areas of growth can make you be a better person I feel like I I think that there is something powerful about admitting your weaknesses admitting that you don't know um that's something that I struggle with I like to know if I don't know I like to know and I like to figure out so that I do know um I had lunch with uh and recently graduated software engineer um while I was in New York and when we were talking like we're like greeting each other being cordial and he was like if I can if I'm honest with you I don't understand half of what people are talking about here and I was like same like oh my god like do you understand like I am so terrified that all of these people will find out I'm a fraud and it's not even like imposter syndrome fraud it's like I have openly said several times of like I am coming from this context in which I have never had to care about any of this stuff until this year when it became my job my very very well paying job so then it was like oh oh crap like if they find out I'm a fraud then it's over for me then like I've got no leg to stand on when when in reality like the things that have gone well are me just admitting like hey I don't know but here's what I don't know and people being like well here's the answer to what you don't know it's this and I go I now know that and but like you never get to that point if you don't just openly admit the flaws that you might have yeah nobody is perfect and that's okay you will never have perfection but it sure is nice to be able to to try and be the best person that you can be and that's kind of that's kind of what the show is is so like yeah I'm not going to say this is who we are but there's this part of it that like this is our purpose and our goals is to try and be the best person that we can be whatever that means um and I really I like it so go team welcome to conduit this is a show about who we are and who we want to be and and and no and who we want to like who we envy in the world for their either ill-gotten gains or their success even though they failed up their entire way into the the success that they're in now or those people who gain value from other from like taking advantage of other people like yeah we don't like you y'all suck wait what were we talking about again I don't know I stopped listening welcome to cotton I'm kidding yeah it's hard it's hard when there's people that you're looking at and you're you're like I'm working so hard and this person has just kind of fallen into stuff um but I think that minimizes I'm not talking about the billionaires not talking about the billionaires I'm gonna put that out there yes but there there's people where you're like how are you in this position why are you and and anytime and this is something that else that I'm working on anytime I know that I I have that thought and that that feeling of frustration is the wrong word but like a little bit of envy a little bit of jealousy um it I do try and be like hold on now check myself why am I feeling jealous like what is what is this coming from what is wrong with not wrong with me but what part do I need to work on myself in order to not have this necessarily be the issue going on if that makes sense I I don't know I I very much feel like again thinking about it from like the side of a parent and thinking about how kids idolize kids will like idolize youtubers and not realize that like most people who do youtube full-time are like minimum wage yeah like it is not not not everybody is mr beast exactly um and even then like how long did mr beast do what he was doing right and like not getting the recognition how long were all these other people when you and like at what cost I have yeah there's a youtuber I'm I don't like body shaming there's a lot of plastic surgery involved that's all I'm saying and there is like this moment where like my daughter is idolizing that person who is a grown adult playing children's games with children um again like not video like they're video games but they're video games that are clearly designed for children and they're talking to them with the mentality of a child and capitalizing off of it while also definitely not missing a botox session so like there is a part of me that has to wrestle with that of like it's I I don't necessarily want my daughter thinking that that is a credible lifestyle that should be pursued um but I also have to realize that like my child is also not dumb um even if she is seven it's it's like saying those expectations I think there's also there's also a concern in that sense of like this is a a human that is making their own choices and who am I to judge it um I'm the person that has to deal with the consequences of those choices though okay but here's the thing is that you use it as an opportunity to have the conversation not necessarily like this person is dumb so much as hey this is what somebody is choosing to do with their life their money and their time and you may not think that is the best option but that doesn't necessarily mean that they're stupid for doing it yeah and and again like I think that that's when we talk about skills like what what I see there is someone has been able to capitalize off of a skill set that they had um and then utilize it in a way that progress them even if I don't necessarily agree with the approach they had the insight to just to like find out that thing about themselves and find a way to capitalize off of it to make money and this is one of those things where it's like I I feel like I have gotten lucky a lot of times because I think people saw something in me that I still don't see in myself and they have put themselves in a position to capitalize off of some of the work that I've put in and I don't have the sense or wherewithal to even recognize it yeah and that feels weird I could see that this is so say what you will and I know you probably have some deep feelings about this um the Kardashians are not my favorite people but anyone that says they're famous for just being famous clearly does not pay attention to the fact that they are working hard at branding their life yes and turning that into financial support benefits whatever using those skills that they are working on to do this now it is paying off in ways that financially you know whatever you want to say about it it feels unfair it feels unfair yeah um and they uh again say what you want about them as people that doesn't matter in this sense you cannot minimize the amount of work and skill that they have at what they do um because that that is that is a mistake that's and I think that's the thing that I'm trying to get to is the like you you saw the lane or they saw the lane and they were willing to put in the work sometimes the very physical sometimes the very body modifying work to capitalize off of the thing that they saw that made them like whatever you want to call them uh icon or a role model to people a an influencer like they were able to see it they were able to understand the all the calculations to get to what they wanted and they were able to do it and like that is a thing that like from the outside I can look at and I can look at it with maybe my own opinions on the decisions that they made but like you said can't knock the hustle but I wish that I had that clearance of foresight that I could just go like oh I'm really good at this thing I can do this thing this way and make a lot of money and again like a lot of that is opportunity like oh I see an opportunity where this is my uh I forgot the the mom's name but like hey I became popular because of who I was married to and then who I was married to again and then now I have turned that into an empire in which my children have built their own legacies yeah like are based in the foundation of the work that was done I don't know any parent out there that wouldn't want to say I have created something in which my children now are financially set for life based on the foundations of the work that I put in like to me that feels that feels like a very resonating moment but what I don't see in that is my kid has no clue what I do she thinks I take meetings all day which she's she's not wrong we played we played how well do you know your family and it was like the question was how do I show people that I appreciate them and her answer was you'll have a meeting with them and I was like oh I was just like no but but also I had a 90 minute call with a with a friend literally that day so like yes so it's it's it's those moments where it's like I I wish that I saw what other people see in me and I wish that I saw how I could leverage that in a way that would inspire my child other than like frustrating her in the number of meetings that I take yeah I mean it's hard when you're little to to really get your kids to to understand and that's okay um I mean to be fair even now my uh uh family does not know what I get uh they don't understand uh they don't understand and that's okay Kathy is an influencer where no books Kathy is a book influencer yeah sure okay I I think we've I think we've talked this one in um yeah I think we're I think we're done oh no there there was there was one last part of this um the skills that our connectors have are like yes ridiculous dude some of y'all speak multiple languages some of y'all are engineers um some of y'all can keep are able to write and create some incredible fantastic things yep some of you like Taylor

be here next episode hey I'm not gonna be here next episode yeah um so a month of maybe writing in a notebook we'll see what happens yeah we'll see yeah we will see love it skipping that marathon running person our profane sleeper of the show Michael Harris says try not to go insane and try to juggle all the household stuff hey try to take it easy I know that's difficult so I'm I'm gonna slide in here with uh a little bit of as somebody that has been a caregiver for gosh 15 years now next month will be 15 years um finding time to separate yourself now is compartmentalization um healthy not really not really but sometimes it's necessary um and one of the one of being able to separate out and not feel guilty to take time to take care of yourself is vital I cannot even say how vital it is this is a marathon not a sprint a full marathon not a half marathon like that Aaron guy's running um so please take care of yourself it's so easy to get burnt out and if you get burnt out you cannot help your family so take that under consideration we uh are sending you so much love and support big hugs our doll of the show Molly says next connection do a non-zero amount of work on a personal

destroy the routine yes that's or okay okay here's another another way to phrase it is to take a break from that and then be able to get back on like that's gonna be difficult but I believe in you oh people with self-esteem that's not self-esteem um self-motivation that's oh yeah that that's a skill that's prop mad props yeah you you get up and run on your own gross I'm sorry what our robotics engineer of the show aiden says reuse the wood from an old table oh into a smaller more useful for the space table if I understand that correctly you're going to repurpose the wood from an existing
