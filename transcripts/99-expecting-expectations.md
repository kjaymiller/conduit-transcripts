From Relay FM, you're listening to Conduit, the show where we condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that is here and has been here for 99 episodes now. This episode is brought to you by our incredible superconductors.
I am Kathy and with me today is this J-guy? I don't know, who is that? It's so hard to say because I haven't talked to him in so long. It's me, the Nintendo Switch 2, that is apparently not coming out anytime soon. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's okay, that's okay.
Let's start with, well, actually first I'm going to start with an apology. As we'll discuss in a little bit and we definitely talked about in the pre-show for our superconductors, it's going to be a low energy week.
And you know what? That's okay because we're accepting of where we are and our brains are. And what's going on? And part of that means I have not really been in the Discord a whole lot.
But when I look at our, the Starboard in the Discord, I see that there is a variety of fun inside jokes, including apparently a pickle phone, which you know what? I don't actually think I want to dive back into that.
And so instead I'm going to say somebody else go into the Discord for you lovely superconductors or members of other shows. And then let me know what I missed. Yeah, that's, yeah, pickle, no, mm-mm, mm-mm, not at all.
And basically it was the pickle phone, like each of the camera cameras on the back of the iPhone was a pickle. And this is the world that AI has built. The worst part is, or I guess best part, I'm not really sure. Basically I'm fairly certain that it was hand-cultivated.
This is the, when they underpaid teachers, this is what happens. Yes. Oh, well, in our co-working, we, well, you, not me, I wasn't there, I was away. Apparently you all talked about how short five minutes is. Yeah, it's.
Yeah, so, so this was part of it because I had two interviews that were five minutes with, uh, next on the docket after I got off of co-working. I was ready to do, uh, no, it was right before co-working. I had, um, interviews with two actors from the Wheel of Time that were five whole minutes.
And it was, it's really short. It's not a long time. We usually tell people, like, when people are speaking at events, they have these things called lighting talks and lighting talks are seven minutes.
And we normally will give them, like, hey, you've gone five minutes, hey, you know, you've got two minutes left, one minute left, 30 seconds left. Like, it's always faster than it feels.
I often tell people, like, if you feel like it was five minutes, make, make it shorter because it's, it's, it's just not going to be, and you've got to be ready for that because, wow, yeah, it, it really is a short time. Yeah.
So, yeah, that sounds like fun, uh, come and hang out with us, uh, or again, hang out mostly Kathy.
I feel like, I feel like it's just been Kathy, like holding down the co-working for the last little bit, but I promise that, uh, my schedule loosens up after next week, so for about a month and then after that, we're not sure. Yeah.
But I, I have a, a thing that I will bring up as a future topic in that I'm, we're really trying to figure the travel thing out, um, at work, but I am also figuring out other things. But that's for another topic. What's next, Kathy? Yeah.
Next up, um, if any of those things sound fun, visit I am a superconductor.com to become a member today. Um, you can, uh, hang out, uh, with us in our co-working sessions in the off weeks.
Um, and usually we are live recording in the discord, um, but not today because, again, we're doing this early. Um, a huge shout out to Merlin Man for joining Jay and surviving the episode, uh, two weeks ago, I laughed out loud so many times in the airport on my way home listening to it.
Um, it was a delight and I can't wait to come back and maybe give a little bit more explanation and, uh, guidance to Merlin, because I'm sorry that he got lost. I, I think what I would love to see is you now do an episode with Merlin.
Uh, you, you, you just, you structure it and do the whole thing because I, I was excited, but also there was like this. I have to be like the master of ceremonies doing the things, but also wanting to have, uh, you know, an engaging conversation.
But I was also like, oh, man, I wonder what it's like for me to host an episode versus Kathy to host an episode. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, so my, my big question I had is this, how much explanation did you give to him before you got on the call? Um, we talked for like a minute or two before we started recording the pre show. Okay. And, and was any of that a description of nope. Okay. Yep.
That's kind of, that's kind of what I thought. I was like, we wrote it down in the dock. If you read the dock, it's the car. J J. No. Oh, okay. Well, this is, this is the level. Okay.
So, and I think, I think our topic is going to be short enough that we can just break things apart and have fun with this.
But I, when I used to do a pit, what do you see productivity and tech? And I interviewed people like I would, I would send them this like candy email that talks about the process and goes through the thing and goes through all the steps.
And like says, hey, you know, this is what you need to worry about. This is what you need to think about. This is how the format works. And people never, ever read the thing. I always read the thing because I want to know what's going on.
And not only read the thing, but I listened to a previous episode of the thing so that I understand what's going on. I get that context. So I, I am like, no, if, if I go through the trouble of explaining the show, giving out the pre dock and then being like, here's what the format looks like.
And then all the only thing I asked was, do you want to be a co-host or a guest? Because if you're a guest, I will just do everything. If you're a co-host, then like, you're doing this with me. And Merlin was like, I'll run it with you. And I was like, okay, cool. Let's, let's go.
But then did you, it sounds like you then didn't also explain what was needed to run it with me. Do you run it with him? He works with John C. Iracusa, which is, I know, but they've also been doing it for how many years. That should prepare you for anything. Yeah. Yeah. Well, clearly it did not.
And that's okay. That's okay. It was entertaining. It was, it was fun. And yeah. Yeah. John, John, look out your own my list for the next guest. Because at least I know that you will read the dock. Well, yeah, but he may not understand it. Oh, no. Nothing, nothing against Iracusa.
But if you're reading, having read the dock without a true understanding or having listened to the show, I think that's a part that it might be, it might be a thing.
Something that I thought was very funny was there was like this, this moment in which, like with Merlin, I thought that like the awe of the show, how was just so nice? Yes. No, that was so funny. It was great. Oh. Yeah. I have a shout out. Yes.
Shout out to, oh, I'm gonna, let me, let me find the name. Shout out to our wonderful developer of the P app, who messaged me after I basically was like, we don't have any hosts or we don't have any sponsors. And this is, you know, horrible and we should fix it, John.
I'm gonna say JG, so the JG of the show, the JG sponsor of the show, John, who messaged me on Macedon saying, hey, creator of the P app here, thank you for sharing your experience with the app on episode 97. It's great to know you found it useful and then it lined up with how hydrated you felt.
So yeah, like, thank you, John. We don't get a lot of folks from our sponsors. We've had a couple of folks that do a shout out to our amazing, it's not our guinea pig of the show, is it? I think it might be. It might be our guinea pig of the show, who gives us all the feedback in the world.
But it is really good. I've talked about, I have some amazing sponsors that are like some of my favorite products and brands.
And I mean, again, I think that there have been, there have been like two or three that have radically changed how I use my phone or just easily inserted themselves into my life. And like, again, the, the P app is, it doesn't make sense how often it gets used, but here we are 234 logs later.
That's incredible, absolutely incredible. I'm so happy that it's been as awesome. I haven't even, so I have downloaded the app, but I haven't been able to really mentally process how I want to use it. So I love, I love that it's working for you so well. That's incredible. Absolutely incredible.
Also sponsors, where y'all at, come on. I know, I know things are getting tighter, but we need you. Well, if they're, I mean, if they were listening to this, they would have probably sponsored. And, but yeah, I know, I know, but Carrie is working on it. But yes. Let's do our connection checks.
How did you do, Jay? So after putting, putting Merlin through what I'm assuming he would call torture. I came to the conclusion that I absolutely needed to run through the, by my keynote again. I didn't. And I will take the red block on that.
However, I will say I wanted to, I asked if it was possible. And like it didn't, like I couldn't get timing to work out. And we were just so darn busy. But I'm still grateful that I was able to like have that moment of just more and more thoughts and things to clarify on.
Because it, it made me put in a lot of time and effort. Actually, I could probably see how much, how much time I spent in Canva in the last flight. Oh, yeah. Let's see. Canva in the last, this year, this year, I've spent 22 hours in Canva.
And if I look back, I'll say in the last two weeks, I have spent two here. I've spent 12 hours in Canva just like working on this presentation. So like, yeah, there was, there's a lot, there's a lot that went into, to getting that work in.
So, and that's, that's, sorry, it was 11 hours and that was 11 hours while traveling to Europe and back and not, and having very little sleep and having to be at a company off site where I turned into an emergency videographer, which, Oh, no. That was not fun.
Basically, a bunch of people in other places around the world got sick and weren't able to come to our off site and our company decided not to record things. So people were really upset that they weren't there to hear about all the cool stuff that we were doing and being a part of it.
So armed with a DJI Osmo Pocket 3 and a laptop, I wound up basically opening up a Zoom call with, with my DJI attached and a whole set. Oh wow. Live capturing the, the events like a bootleg. Oh my gosh.
At one point, we had like two tables stacked on top of each other and then the, the pocket and like, like, set standing mode and running and playing stuff. And again, it was, it was worth it and I would do it again.
And you know, there's pictures of me like holding my arm like with my other arm just to keep it. Because your hand was so tired. Yes. Oh my gosh. So yes, amongst all of that, I was like, I still got to focus on this, but no, I didn't get alive.
I didn't get a rehearsal in and it showed in my talk, but I think the talk still went well. Good. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and that's a, that's a good comment on our topic. But before we do that, here is our conductors connections. Hello, friends. It's Jay. Kathy's out.
So I am going to be doing the connections for this episode. So let's start with one that I may have missed or one they came out right after the show, which was from Irizano, who is our Esferanto Knitter of the show.
Irizano says, green apple, I think the last one was about bringing my MacBook to the genius bar and surviving without it for a while. I survived. It works again. So green apple if it was in question mark, if it wasn't, I get that.
The, ah of the show, ah, said green check room is gone from out of control to mostly in control, which is really all you can ask for. Yes, that is indeed all you can ask for.
The profane sleeper of the show, Mike says the trial gym membership was a success, but I'll have to wait until getting an actual membership because I'm saving for a trip.
Oh, I wonder what the trip is to have fun on your trip and good luck saving our checklist enthusiasts of the show Mike says green check mark, I finished moving my personal tasks or reminders successfully move my entire system to reminders and it's working pretty well. Good.
Our pathologist of the show, Laura says new connection paint some I have a project I've been wanting to work on but I'm having trouble getting started. I'd like to do some more painting preferably on that topic this fortnight.
Oh, Laura sounds like you didn't have a new connection, a previous connection, which, oh dear, I feel like I have messed up Laura's connection for the second time into episodes.
Our identical twin of the show Aaron says a connection check yellow circle, I had to take it a bit easier on running to let my body heal, but I managed to take a gentler pace, which has been helping good.
Our Canadian trivia card enthusiast of the show Erica, welcome back Erica says question mark, I've been a well from conduit for so long. I don't even know what my last connection was. I've still been listening though.
Well, welcome back Erica, we're glad to have you back or Carl of all trades of the show Carl says yellow green paperwork started rewriting my resume and applying for a job got overwhelmed but will take a fresh stab at it tonight.
Our chiefs of the show Andrew says connection check green check mark my yearly theme of responsibility is going well and I'm finding that rebuilding my life can't let me have more of what I've always wanted. Oh, can indeed indeed it can can let me have more than I've always wanted awesome.
I'm glad to hear that our tech pad our tech podcast listener of the show, Pollock says green check green book. Texas have been completed. Good job. Our soprano of the show. Devos says green heart made progress on feature planning for my teams next software release.
And our nameless of the show nameless says a lot got done this conduit green circle. I've scheduled 15 meetings that absolutely couldn't be emails trust me. I tried all of them are scheduled between this week and the end of May.
But I've built game plans for four major events happening in the next two months fingers crossed nothing or no one derails them. Also I booked my tax appointmenting and found an extension and bought more coffee beans, but it still might not be enough. That sounds like a lot.
A hard code monkey of the show Douglas says check mark tax has got done and completed my two honeydew list items that Mrs. and she has been after me for six months to complete good job.
And our robotics engineer of the show, Aiden says green square there's now something of a list of improvements in the works, including apparently new floors. So at least we have an idea of what we can do once it's finally time. Awesome. So did it did it did it did it. Yeah. Okay. So. Okay.
So earlier you mentioned that you did not get a rehearsal in and that you were able to kind of see it in the performance, but that it's or in your not performance, but in your talk. And I think that you were so happy with it.
And I think this is a great kind of lead into the topic that I had which came from my weekend. Because there's a lot of whenever you do anything that takes rehearsals and practice and prep work. And you put it out there into the world. There's always some level of expectations.
And it's it can be difficult to balance those expectations, especially when you end up dealing with disappointment. This this topic idea came because so we had our dance team championships this past weekend for the studio.
And my amazing kiddo got first in their duo and first in their solo and the dance that they choreographed got third, which was really exciting. All three of those. But then when it came to the team dances the next day, none of them placed. And it was a it was a little bit of a disappointment.
And there was a lot of other people that were disappointed. And it kind of came down to a variety of things, including the judges and some individuals did not do their best performances. And just a couple couple different pieces of it.
And I know that this can be put into other parts of life in general. And just kind of like how do you deal with setting up these expectations? So this this is interesting because I feel the opposite at the moment.
As I'm going into this role of like this management role and all this stuff and I'm folks trust me. I promise I'll stop talking about it. I haven't gotten my title change yet. As soon as I get my title change, we'll talk about it one more time and I won't bring it up again.
Yeah, well, okay, hold on. I'm going to stop you right there. Beyonce had the best album of all time. But this is also still a part of your life. Like this is going to be a part of your work life. Yeah.
And for the foreseeable future because I mean, I don't plan on like if I were to have to change jobs, I would probably want to go back into the management role now that I have it now that I have experience with it. But yeah, the problem is at the moment I'm acting as a player coach.
So I'm having to provide guidance and manage and make decisions based on the knowledge that I have in around what the companies plans are and all that stuff. I then have to be a part of the execution on that while also being in all of the other decision space.
And I talked about this in a way to one of my colleagues and I basically said like, I feel bad because what I feel like I have to do is set expectations for the team that we all have to hold each other accountable to. But also I know that at the given moment, I can't meet those expectations. Yeah.
And it's rough because it's like this exact moment of hey, we all need to write at least like one blog post for the company a month. And we need to it's based off of work that we've already done, but we just have to do that. And it's like everyone else is hitting their numbers except for me.
And it's not that I don't want to do them. I've started the content. I just haven't finished the content. And also a lot of it is like I'm writing I'm writing more now than I've ever written. It's just none of it is for the blog. It's for executives. It's for my management chain.
It's for company strategy team strategy. Like I'm meeting with people from other companies who are asking me questions. And I was like, I'm not prepared for this.
So now I'm like writing thousands of emails to people about, hey, I need to sit down and talk with you in schedule a meeting so that you can teach me about this thing or how the company does this thing.
And it sucks because all of that all of that means I don't have time to do the thing that I'm asking of my team myself included to do. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's. Yes, I feel you deeply with that.
But I think the thing that's interesting in your situation is your kiddo is excelling like excelling in the things that they're doing that are less dependent on the performance of others. Well, yes, except for the parts when they are dependent on the others.
And so like with the with the team routines. And so their individual performance. Only impacts. You know, 120th of the score because all they can do is their best. So when it comes down to it, yes, it's it's frustrating. Not in to be fair, I want to make this point that like they're not eight.
Oh, well, some, some. They're angry at some of their teammates just because there has been a history of lack of care on some people's minds, but not for ones that like slipped on the floor and tripped like. Obviously, it's not their fault.
Like so so they're still doing their best to try and be a good teammate and a leader, but it's it's it's hard when the amount of effort and energy they've put into things is not also put in by everybody else. Yeah.
I think the other part of that too is that even though they make up 120th of the team, they don't make up 120th of the score. Yes. If everybody does their job and two people mess up, it's not 80%. It's it's significantly lower. I would have to assume. Yeah.
And I think that there is there's like that interesting mentality of I think of like relay relay runners. You can run the fastest leg of a relay race that you've ever ran in your life. You could set a record for how fast you ran your leg of the race and your team still come in last place. Yeah.
And that is such a weird and like unbearable like thought. Actually, there was a there was a YouTube short that was just talking about this. There was a relay runner, not not our podcast, but I started to type in relay and I immediately put like relay.fm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So John. Yeah.
So like. Yeah. There was I'm trying to remember the person or the wonderful woman who. Okay. Yeah. I found it. So this was Switzerland's Melissa. I'm sorry if I mess up your last name. Good Schmidt. And like great runner. Absolutely. Oh no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
It appeared to be perfectly positioned to win for our country, but a late surge by a Dutch runner, Tossagia, led to a neck and neck finish. And then Netherlands ultimately came the became the winner. Okay, yeah. Good Schmidt tripped right before crossing the finish line.
So like imagine like you're like running. You're doing this amazing race. You're doing super fantastic. You you get in front. You have the lead and all of a sudden you just eat it and like hit the ground and it's over. And your team has executed flawlessly. You've executed 99.
9% of the rate of your part of the race flawlessly. But you still didn't finish. And I don't even think you came in second. Like you fell and I think came in like third or fourth because of just like how you fell and I have to get back. This last little bit yeah yeah yeah.
And and that there's something that's so like real about that in life. Like I've you know not not to be too open about like personal finances and stuff.
But like when when Brittany and I first got married we were like okay cool we are making more money than we were ever making before because I was in the military and the military does not pay you well. But you get a bunch of benefits. Like that's the opposite of it.
So we were both going we're both working and we're like we are doing so good. We have our little apartment. We're going to be able to buy a house or at some point you know life is good.
And then we get a letter from the I you know our tax rate we do our taxes and our taxes are like you owe so much more money now because congratulations making above you know all the money that you make out of the military put us combined in a new tax bracket.
So we were getting taxed way more than we were before. Well okay to be fair to be fair. I do want to make sure that you're aware that the way the tax brackets work is it's only that additional tax bracket ink like tax income is only above a certain limit.
So your whole income was not taxed at a different tax bracket. It's only the portion of it. So just just putting that out there for anyone that's like going to yell or argue or be like yeah but like it's only a portion of the time thing. So yeah but yes continue on.
 But it was it was like that moment where we thought we were like doing so good to like now we owe thousands of dollars to the IRS unplanned and it wasn't like we had broken any rules like we we did all the things apparently Britney's employer wasn't taking taxes out and that was due to some like well normally we would but you made under some threshold so we don't have to and we didn't and like now you're just like what's going on with that that sucks life's miserable.
And again like we we sat with tax professionals and they were like yeah I guess this sucks I mean but ultimately you got to pay it and that set us back like three or four years.
Like we were we thought that we were like on the path on the trajectory to doing the thing but now it was like all the extra income that we had had to go back to paying the IRS.
And then we're like all right cool we've done we've done the thing we're good and then I got promoted at work and then we owed more taxes the following year and I was like what are we doing wrong?
 Something is wrong here we need to fix this and then we sat down with the professional and we finally got it fixed and then like finally in like the third and fourth year of our marriage things got better and then we were able to buy a house and we were able to do all these things but it was just like expectations were different than yeah the reality.
Yeah like I grew up in I'd always filed taxes in Georgia where like you always get money back.
 I've like even this year I was so worried because I had you know I'd pulled out money from when we moved and like right when we were moving and I was changing jobs and I you know added some money in to get some stuff done and we had to replace our floors and like we had all these things that happened and I was like I pulled money out of like investments thinking like oh I'm supposed to hold on to these for longer than this I'm going to take a tax penalty on it.
 We didn't come out like glaringly above but we got money back and I was like okay cool we're back in Georgia where apparently taxes are weird and you just always wind up with some money back even if it's like $10 which to me to say is I did good versus California where you always owe money like it doesn't matter you could I've seen people put extra money in thinking like okay I'll get ahead of this and they still wind up being frustrated because you know they owe like $100 to the state or something else because the state taxes are buck wild and yeah all of that to say like the only thing that you can do at that point is go like what can I do differently so that this doesn't happen again and hope that it doesn't happen again like there again there's only so much that you control and at some point like you can prepare yourself 100% to never let this happen again and it still happened again and I think the only other thing that you can do is say in that case what can I do that if it happens again it won't be as devastating as last time and yeah I don't know what the answer is in this case of you know again just waiting on or having to rely so heavily on the performances of others yeah well real real quick hi I have been working with the tax professional for almost 10 years now and the best thing that you can do this is for the audience and for yourself is do what's called a tax projection recommended at the very least in the fall around September October using you know a pay stub and investment or like all of the information that you have they can run it through your tax professional can run it through the system and get an idea of hey you should be paying a little bit more you don't need to pay a second you know quarterly taxes at whatever the expectations are in place to be able to make adjustments and not be surprised during tax time highly recommend having a tax professional if you are a freelancer and have extra money or if you are interested and this is not a paid promotion but you know what I will and oh no actually I don't make any financial benefit from this either so you can visit cfoandrew.
com for someone that I have worked with for a very long time and discuss like and and part of that includes free tax projections it's a monthly payment you're able to ask whatever questions you want if you want a tax projection every month you can do that I really that was something that I had a huge relief because I was actually a client before I started working for him because the idea of not having any surprises was really great so I highly recommend something similar to that so thank you cfoandrew.
com for sponsoring my life yeah for sponsoring Kathy and keeping her out of jail yes also they do relay taxes so that's cool too yeah okay so and all of relanth of yeah and all of us eat literally a huge thanks to cfoandrew.
com for supporting me and all of relanth of so yeah so yeah cfoandrew you know what to do give us a call we need them sponsors baby yeah I it was funny that as I was talking about this I blanked out and then to just immediately remembered like I literally just talked about this yesterday in my keynote like in the actual keynote like the whole idea was the whole topic of the of the keynote was it was supposed it was a guide for people who did one type of work in tech who were considering like oh I should add a community component to it and I was walking through this idea of just what do you do when you have these expectations and either you can't meet them because of all of the other things that you have to do this like this list of disorganized tasks that you have to do or you are like you really wish you had help and like no one was there to help you and one of my slides I copied and added I posted it on mass it on and I was just like this this is such a phrase there is always more that you could have done if you are doing something then it is helpful and it is going to be helpful like we yes we can prepare there are always things that we could do more but it we should at least be trying to do something and I think as long as we are trying to do something I don't think that you know I I put it this way if you are paying something the IRS is not going to lock you up if you are paying something well and to be also a lot of right right not a IRS for that but yeah having having having worked with them and saying look you want all this money I don't have it this is what I can give you like they will work with you versus saying I don't have it oh no I'm going to go run and hide like being able to just say here is what I'm capable of doing I've seen this with with tax like if you have like credit problems too like when they talk about like you know if you have a lot of credit debt then you call the creditor and you just go hey look I know that I owe this money this is what I'm capable of doing now and sometimes they can work with you I've had the bank do that with us like weird overdraft things that happen just because you thought money was there and then it isn't and you're like oh no a mistake happened and like yeah yeah I've had it having with hospitals a medical debt because they're so excited to get literally anything yeah so like and I mean I'm not saying this in just like from again not financial advice I'm not a financial person you should talk to a financial professional but also like being able to just show up and do something is so much better than being like well it's out of my control there's nothing I can do and I mean the only advice I could possibly give the the the the tinier soup is if that person if there if it's the same person that's constantly falling right before you get to the finish line no offense to that person like having a conversation with that person and just being like hey if if it's nerves like no one's blaming you for this and honestly I feel like that helps if if at the end we're like look we know it's your fault but also like nobody is upset with you I'm not upset with you yeah except for when we are upset with them and I do that lovingly and I would never ever like I'm not going to be a complete biot to a child but also doing my best not to me yeah yeah it's yeah it's yeah it's been an interesting season well I just I think about that too of like this is why team sports are so hard but I also think that this is why team sports are good for kids when executed properly like yes there are so many things in life that are just like bad things are going to happen and there is nothing that you could do about it and it's all because of that person next to you and as much as you really want to punch that person in the face you have to be like amicable at least towards them yes and and that is such a feeling I have so many names I could say of people in the military that made my life harder so many people in boot camp like in boot camp it is literally like someone made a mistake and now we all have to pay for it is it is that on repeat for three months it is just like well yeah so and so boots came untied now we all have to suffer for it oh someone didn't make their rack correctly we all have to suffer for it someone coughed when we were supposed to be quiet we all have to suffer for it and a lot of that is done in the essence of like when you are in a real world mission and silence is key your cough could be the thing that ends people's lives or when you don't when you forget the thing that you were supposed to supposed to bring or the message that you were supposed to relay like yes it comes at a very realistic cost like the whole like we have to stay awake and not fall asleep on duty and things like that I have been in situations where I have to stay up for 48 hours and sleep on razor wire but on top of like coiled razor wire not like open razor wire but like coiled safely stored razor wire as like a spring for like a bed type thing for about 20 minutes at a time because if we don't get the network up people will die and it's due to a hurricane it's not some enemy it's yeah mother nature right mother nature hating your kids and all of those things like we were talking about this earlier in the pre-show gavi like I want to get home I want to change my bag sleep for eight hours get on a car and go back to the airport but I can't because of thunder and lightning in the airport sending me to a whole nother state and I have to sit there and just be upset and there's nothing I can't be mad at the pilot I can't be mad at anybody else and I got to change I got to change my entire plans because thunder and lightning like nothing I do and I mean maybe that's what we do I guess we just laugh it off and go well this two shall pass and we'll just keep it moving yeah yeah I think I think I mean well and you know let's be on as life is always going to be that way there's always going to be things that are going to not meet expectations and so it's it can be difficult to like balance those expectations and still have hope and I think that's a hard thing is like yeah you can hope that you're going to you know place at all but also like not be okay with not have to be okay with not happening oh well and here here's like a non like thing so one of the actors that I interviewed her name is Priyanka Bose she plays Alana Sadai in the Wheel of Time in the books the Green Aja which Alana is part of is the Aja that I most identify with similar to that wizard show with the different houses that we don't talk about it's the battle Aja and I got really excited and emotional before I was going to talk to her because this is like her specifically the episode that was episode 7 of season 3 that came out it showcases the the warrior aspect of this Aja really well not just with the actual fighting but in the power that she has over like the protectiveness and the teaching aspect of stuff and it was really it's a fantastic episode but that's neither here or neither listen to the drag mount podcast to hear me wax poetic for hours and hours anyways so I was really excited to talk to her and I had these expectations I had prepped the questions like really solidly and and I felt prepared and then the way that they do it there so I don't know if you're in a waiting room for if you're I'm sure you're familiar with in a waiting room for a zoom and you sometimes will have the option to either mute or unmute or turn your video on or off before it loads they always have it to where it's you can't do the video so you can't turn the video on you have to turn it on when you get in the call and as discussed in the co-working five minutes is a very short amount of time and I have forgot to click the video button so I'm doing this interview and I am talking to her but she can't see me all she can see is my little jelly um drying with me in the unicorn hoodie and I make a reference to something that's in my background to which she says I can't see you and my heart and stomach dropped to the floor and I felt like such an idiot but I had to you know keep it up had four and a half more minutes to go let's go let's go and yeah it's it's exhausting and frustrating and so sad um when stuff doesn't go how you want it to but it was you know I ended up doing okay and uh that was all on me that was nobody else's fault yeah I think one of the things especially with something like that I think that we have one we have the highest expectations for ourselves than anyone else unless you're a woman on the internet and then which everyone else in the world will have the most unrealistic expectations I appear to call yes um and for that I apologize for my gender um it's fine I'm gonna apologize for my race so you know it's it's usual but in most cases I would say the expectation that people have towards you is relatively low and that we put extra pressure on ourselves and this was this is a thing that I have started owning up to like just again like I had to give this keynote yesterday and I was like I am not ready for this I don't know what's gonna happen I originally had like 60 slides to go through in 45 minutes that's not realistic at all because I like to talk a lot I need to just clean out slides and I clean out a bunch of slides I was trying to run through it but I didn't get a good rehearsal through and I'm just like I'm I'm up on stage now like there's nothing I can do I know all the mistakes that I made the audience doesn't know any of them because they don't know what it took to get to that point and even the areas where I did make a very clear mistake I fixed it with laughter I canva is a great tool for presentations until you actually have to present them because for some reason you can't you can't move you can't present on one screen and then have your speaker notes up on the other one apparently that's just illegal you can't do that every other presentation software has figured that madness out but not canva oh no and of course not yeah and so I sat there for five minutes trying to figure it out wasting the time wasting everyone's time their break time is being affected by this and it's funny that this is my full-time job and all I could say was wow for someone who gets paid to go up on stage and give talks you think I'd have the basics down and everyone just laughed and I was like cool everyone I pulled the wool over their eyes they saw my frustration they saw me disengage it with laughter and they were there for me and supportive and that was awesome but what they don't realize was it wasn't that it was every second that I was wasting trying to figure out how the stupid presentations offer worked that was me not developing my strategy for doing what I would call a 45-minute stand-up routine that is not meant to be funny but is meant to be helpful and that while I knew what flow I wanted and while I knew what emotions I wanted to convey I had no clue what the next words were going to be that would come out of my mouth and that level of anxiety is torturous but at the end everyone clapped everyone donated everyone had a good time everyone complimented me and said it was so good and that they were talking about individual things that I said that just resonated with them they were talking about some of the slight choices that I picked and how like they saw and they just felt like I was talking directly to them and like all those things and like that's the thing is like that mistake oh I don't have my camera up oh well okay cool let me turn on boom all right let's just keep it going haha oh I'm so silly okay moving on like in that moment it feels so devastating when in reality like unless it's a video podcast no one's going to notice and even if it is a video podcast put up a little sign that just his camera wasn't working and then like edit that part out and figured yeah I basically I basically leaned into it yeah I like went and and in the intro for the video and I by the I'm actually publishing the video later today so I'll be able to add a link in the show notes to watch it and I you know I try not to take myself too seriously as witnessed by the fact that I have you know porn headphones that are bright pink and light up and so you know there's a level already that I'm not trying to be this sleek professional person because that is not who I am but the idea that you know people are listening to you care about yourself more than other people do most of the time you're paying attention you know and that's it's hard to get over mentally but you know what we're doing great you're doing great I'm doing great Jay's doing great mini soups doing great everyone is doing their best and sometimes that's just not enough and that's also okay yeah and and I love sports that are like when you beat your personal best that's one of the reasons why I do like track I like track and field because what you'll often hear are when they talk about people who perform it's often they're performing against themselves and they're they're talking about oh this person's personal best is this and they can they beat their personal best and I love that I love a sport where like yes there is a part of me that wants to be the greatest person in the world but also there's a person that I'm the same person that just wants to do a little bit better than I did last time and I even take that way comes to podcasting creating content giving talks like I have read so many little tricks about when you're interviewing people like look at the waveform and make sure it's balanced between like sharing the the mic and stuff and Kathy I don't know if you remember this but like the first few episodes of conduit you were just like Jay stop interviewing me like there's so many pieces of this that we're we're trying to become more comfortable in the work that we do we're trying to become more confident in ourselves and and we don't do perfect every single time but I think like how can Kathy be upset you know with herself when I'm over here interviewing her instead of sharing a podcast like there's there's only so much that you know you have control over and that I have control over and even when we're exhausted even when we haven't slept in our own houses you know for days on in even when we're like I got to get this done early because the next day I got to leave again or Jay hasn't shown up in like three weeks to a freaking coworking session and then only only once has it not been been their fault yeah Jay how's your alarm system working this one talking about it uh-huh uh-huh yeah yeah you know we're we're all hopefully doing your best and I think that's okay because yeah we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna we're human and um yeah yeah yeah go team go team that's that should just be how we end like in that section every time go team ready go team one two three go all right well Jay what are you gonna work on for the next four night before our hundredth episode oh man I I wanted it to be something special but I got nothing special so like the reality is I have a whole like for people who are going to be at PG day Chicago is as if you hear this I'm sorry okay I don't believe in the idea of conference talk driven like development where like you don't have an idea but you put out a conference talk and then if it gets approved you work on that idea however what I will say was I had full confidence that I was going to have time to work on this idea and now here we are a week before the event so like I have what I have and I don't have like zero but I definitely don't have a hundred so my my connection is going to be to get as much as possible done to pull off an amazing talk next week in Chicago I again I don't I'm gonna stick to what my title says I'm gonna give you that but I hope you're not expecting someone who's invested years and years in these topics even though I have it's just I haven't been able to sit down long enough and and get my thoughts together maybe I should call Merlin and say hey yeah maybe explain a little bit more what you're going to ask from him first just putting that out there yeah no this is this is purely I have learned a lot in the last and since I started out on the journey of getting this talk done and unfortunately I have just not had the time to compile all of those thoughts into something that would be like a desirable presentation for them so I'm I'm going to do my best on that and the best part is it's 20 minutes if if it goes poorly it went poorly and I never have to show my face in Chicago again like it's fine I will live on manage yeah what about you yeah I uh I don't even know um I am okay you know what I am going something that I feel like yes it's adding another thing to my plate but I think it will be cathartic is I need to get back into journaling um and just scribbling down thoughts I'm not going to set a time limit or a page limit or any of that I'm not like I'm just gonna I just want to write just having some time to like export this stuff from my brain I think might help um help me settle some things hopefully um so yeah we'll we'll see how that goes I like it yeah yeah all right and look at me writing it down in the thing uh and uh what about our our uh connectors hello everyone it's me again um time to do the second half of the connections let's see if I can get this right our
