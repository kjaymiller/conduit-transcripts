From Relay FM, you're listening to Conduit, the show where we condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Conduit, the show that helps you decide your favorite seasons, whether it's salt, pepper, cumin, garlic salt, or fall.
This episode is not brought to you by a sponsor, but we have a very exciting conversation that we will have later in the show after connections. So make sure you stick around. I'm Kathy and I am joined by the always wonderful and great and incredibly talented traveling J. J.
Don't like the traveling will berries, but yes, exactly. Or the traveling pants. Yes, look, I didn't write anything down. So I'm doing all of this by the state of my pants, which is why it's terrible. So the traveling J. It's like a bird. It's like a bird blues folk band thing. Like it.
The traveling J in the traveling J's. Oh, yes, I'm here for it. You know what else I'm here for? I'm here for shout outs. Yes, I wasn't going to say pie at all. No, because I'm definitely not here for pie. I will choose literally anything other than pie. No, it's all right. Every time.
Give me literally anything. Give me pie before you give me cake. Wow. All right. So welcome to the final episode of Condo it. So many threats. So many threats. Just kidding though. We I love you Jay. Let's give our shout outs. Yeah. Right now, I don't know.
I don't think people can hear the pitter-patter rain drops, but I am coming from a top secret location where addicts tend to go when they are addicted to pins. I am at pin addict headquarters from the wonderful pin addict podcast from Relay FM. So it's on and it yeah, this is great.
A little known fact. The the host and creator of the Panatic Brad Doudy in I. I used to live in the same town and did not know until I moved away long, long time ago.
So now we are I am visiting family, which means I am also visiting Brad, which means I'm also getting my fix of analog tools, which is great. I always enjoy a visit. So yeah, shout out to Brad for letting me use his studio and his office.
So if I sound any different, that is because I am not in my normal space. And if you say I sound better, that tells me I will have to go out and spend money, which please don't please to say you sound fine. You sound exactly like you do at home.
And there's no reason to spend any more money on anything else other than pins and maybe paper. Jay, you sound absolutely glorious at home. There's no need to spend any money on anything else other than maybe pens, not paper. You already spent a lot of money on paper.
So you don't need to do that right there. Oh, yeah, I like the I like the message and chat to stop spending money. That's great. That's a very good job. What about you, Kathy? I'm giving a shout out to the incredible team over at Cotton Bureau. Stay tuned. We have some exciting things coming up.
And in order for that to happen, we have a very very special like, connection with Cotton Bureau. They have to work some magic and wiggle their fingers to let things happen for us to do what we're going to do. And they have been so kind and gracious and generous.
And the best part is is they will get to send a little bit of love with everything that is bought in the future. When they eventually are able to get up, but they have arrived. The secret pieces of paper have arrived at the location. So we're getting closer. The egg is in the nest.
I repeat the egg is in the nest. Exactly. Exactly. All right. Looks like you have one more there. I do. And this is shameless self promotion time. Jay has a new project. It is a weekly project. It is a weekly project that I am not doing on my own.
And there will be no editing because I have been I have been told that these things are bad for my health. So I am doing a show called the Python Community News. If you are a programmer and you were into Python, this is the show for you.
This the idea was to create a programming show that didn't involve programming bits. So it is a news show where we talk about the news and events happening around the Python community. No pip installs required.
I will say that even though the topics are from the perspective of two people who write Python in their day to day, I think anybody that works in tech can learn from the topics that we bring up in the last we've done two episodes now. And it's weekly. It's launched.
It goes out every Friday at 3pm Pacific time, 6pm Eastern. And well, Kathy, when I say I got to flex my automation muscles. Oh my goodness. It was so good. I'm so happy. It is so automated.
We we record the show using topics that we gather during the week that are all compiled into show notes, a newsletter, and a blog post. And it requires zero editing from us that we just have to hit the button and press go. And it's like all the things made and some of it is code that I wrote.
And some of it is using code that I've been working on for years. So I am so like stoked for this project. Obviously we're in the early days. So we're we're still trying to grow and get the word out. So yeah, if you're a programmer and that sounds like you're jam.
Python community news all one word. And so I'm doing a thing that I would always want to do it. Amazing. So are you planning on talking about other snakes at all or strictly pythons? We're actually going to be talking about rubies and gems and Java, which is both a country.
And I'm going to be talking about Ruby's and Jim's and Ruby's and Ruby's. And so I'm going to be talking about Ruby's and Ruby's and Ruby's and Ruby's. Java, which is both a country and a nickname for coffee. But yeah. But no rattlesnakes or cotton. Mouths cotton heads. No arrowheads cotton mouths.
I don't know my snakes. I really I really need to do more research on snakes, I think. I just like the one biber that has the eyelids because they they they just look really silly. So I lied I actually have one more shout out. This is the season of studio photos for my dancers.
And I got to take all the photos of my kids stand studio their competition team. But more importantly, I got to help like support one of the dancers in high school who is taking photos of the high school team. And each of their individual like headshots and dance poses and group photos.
I stopped by as a joke to be like, how dare you take photos of each other without me. It's you know against the rules. But and so they were nervous that I was going to you know take it over. But of course not because this isn't my photo shoot.
This isn't I'm just here to support and I'm very glad that I was there to help because the photographer's camera died in the middle. And that was a really stressful moment. But I still had my other camera in the car. So we were able to get things covered, taking care of they did an incredible job.
I'm so proud. And it's it's fun to remember those early stages of learning things where you don't know everything where it's not you know by road how you're you're okay pose like this.
Do this do that and it kind of helped refresh my memory because I've been a photographer now for like 14 15 years something like that. So it was really nice to remember that joy of learning new things and getting to help someone else is also really nice.
I just had this conversation with Brad earlier about the experience that we got to do folks check out the Panatic Stream and YouTube channel. Apparently the YouTube there will be a YouTube video up of me with Brad doing things but the. Kathy have you like sushi right I love sushi perfect.
Are you familiar with the phrase omelcase. Uh tickles something in my brain, but I'm not 100% sure why. So omelcase is like this experience where with communication with the chef the chef prepares a series of plates for you.
Yes, yes, I got to do that with pens today and it was it was this moment of me being a pen nerd for several years and understanding kind of like the why I liked pens a certain way.
But not knowing the technical aspects of them and not knowing the depth of all of the penness that is like the knowledge that Brad has. So it was it was literally like okay try this pin this is a blah blah blah blah blah pen and I'm like oh cool.
Oh this yeah I don't this thing tapers at the end really weird I don't know if I like that okay so you want this type of pen sure okay so then try this pen it's other blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and then I was just like this this was amazing so by the end of it.
I was able to get like I was able to look at like three different pens from like three different price ranges and three different nib styles and I understood what nib sizing was and things like that.
 And it was it was this moment of just like this is what it feels like when you have the knowledge of something and you get to share that experience with someone else in such an intimate way and I feel like that's something similar to what you were able to do of like letting them have that experience but also being able to work with them in the same.
 And there's a question in chat that says if I try to stub nib I'm actively using a stub nib for the first time today so this is there's like there's so many yeah there's so much that's happening in this space that I I love that the topic that we're bringing today really hits on that but I think before topics ever mind Kathy this is your show you.
Yeah we are so thankful for everyone in our community and all of the absolutely amazing things that they do and because of that we want to invite you to join the relay FM community.
 You can go to relay dot FM slash membership or go straight to relay dot FM slash conduit to become a member of conduit and then part of that joyous membership perk is to come hang out in the discord with us which right now we have several of our favorite conductors you're all my favorites don't tell anyone else in the chat with us and so they can ask question.
You know get confirmation and clarification on things it's just a great space to be supportive and lovely and I just love recording this show with them hanging out with us it just makes it so super special. So thank you to all of our members and all of the members of relay FM switch on directly.
And I think it's time for a connection check. Zip. Wait a second. Jay, how did you do it? There we go. Jay, how did you do it with your connection? So my connection last week was I'm working on a fancy work job project. And I am playing the role of project manager slash coordinators, slash owners.
Like all the, this is my project for me to do good slash bad slash whatever. And I am my connection was to schedule all of the interviews that I needed to have with people. And would you believe I have scheduled all of the interviews except for one.
And that person I reached out to and they did not get back to me. So like this is, this is like not on me, but I've not only scheduled all of the interviews that I've actually had most of them. There are only two interviews left to be had and they'll be had tomorrow and Thursday.
So green all around. I was able to come up with my questions, do my initial calls. And I've even pushed myself to not take too much time. Which is an interesting concept for someone who does a podcast for living. And we try to hit certain time points.
Normally I would be like, yeah, this will take an hour. And I realize that it'll take as much time as I give it. So I said, this will take 30 minutes. And even some of the people being interviewed were like, do you think that's enough time? And I was like, yes, we will, we will make it enough time.
Amazing. I'm so proud of you. Well done. What about you? So I have an orange circle, but it's okay. So I still have boxes in the front room that need to be unloaded. However, I have done several of them put away.
But more importantly, I've gotten into a pattern of doing more like house things throughout the day. Instead of like, okay, it's now I'm done working. I am going to clean the house. And then I get tired. And the idea of clean the house is such a big, big overwhelming experience.
I shall always say, which means that I just don't do that. So instead, I've been kind of doing little things throughout the day. Like this morning while I was waiting for coffee to go. I cleaned out the, like the little coffee nook.
And I transferred our coffee serups into fancy little like glass jars. So they're pretty. And like just kind of doing these things. So it's, it's progress in a different way. But it's okay to have an orange circle because it didn't complete the connection.
And instead, I am making it, I guess a bigger connection, a bigger journey. I'm being aware of that. So that's fantastic to me. I'm very happy with not with where I am. I like it. And I like that.
Did you originally say that you were going to do all of it or you were just going to do some, you were going to start doing it? Because I think I said that I was going to take care of all of the boxes in the front room. Okay. Okay. Well, I mean, yeah, like I think that.
That's definitely one of those feelings of you, you, you made the attempt. You put forth the effort. So yeah, no, totally home run. I like it. Yeah. Yeah. All right. So let's jump into our conductor. So Deborah has a big green check mark.
She booked her flights and hotel for our cross country trip to go to my cousins wedding and see family members. And I'm so excited for you, dear soprano of the show to have that trip and hang out with friends. Yay. Water Brian, the hydration of the shows has been learning about writing the wave.
Sunday, I had the idea of taking responsibility, click in a whole new way. And I'm finding freedom in that concept because it's allowing me to need things in order to follow through with my responsibilities. And that realization is swatching my feelings of guilt at having needs.
I think anytime you can use the word swatching, absolutely a green check. So way to go. I also definitely did not time the like who was doing which connection to not have to say that word. All right.
Our favorite train enthusiast of the show rail Z has a big green heart with the airplane taking off emoji all packed and ready to go as you're reading this live. I am in an airport hotel before I fly when you'll hear it released. I'll have arrived.
I love the fact that it's like timed with our recordings and releasing that so much fun. The checklist was a great idea and thanks Jay for that private help in DMs. Absolutely. I always tell people DMs are open if you are a relay FM member and you have thoughts and opinions.
Because I will have them back and we can share them and we can hopefully come up with somebody being helped. Like so far or close the show who has a red circle and they did not start writing on any papers book promotion self got very overwhelming and we'll say overwhelming for three weeks.
But they'll get back to papers when they have the head space. I get that so and I totally understand that you are you're in the midst of like big things happening and sometimes big things happening mean like especially the unknown.
It's hard to plan anything when you're really not sure how involved or not involved certain tasks will be. Yeah exactly and so you may have a red circle but not from like a trying but from the world's coming in and taking over for very exciting things. But also it's stressful so yeah we'll done so.
All right ponders are newest conductor. Their first connection check is here and there of the show name is the last file which stands for means a person who loves the sea. I definitely got clarification on how to pronounce it so we're good to go.
So their connection check is having power listened through the show my first connection was to name my system and I took a cue from J.
It's called the TLC system one of the patterns I've developed because of bipolar to is believing that I can't finish a project unless I can sit down and do it all at once.
That I'll lose the thread or give up or never get it done my new system is designed to help me work on incremental progress as a practice and get better at it.
Or to put it in other words I should it should help me not go chasing waterfalls and to get me more use to rivers and lakes plus side whenever I need a reminder I can put on the death cab for cutie cover and feel grounded focused and ready to take on the world.
Incre mentally of course that is the perfect first connection not just because you named your system which is awesome but you wove in a great song. And I we're so excited to have you here and so excited that you have named your system so well brick and done.
 And are and also thank you for reaching out to me as well with some great feedback and some questions and stuff I feel bad because I've only gone through about half of it and I need to get through the rest of it and I will I will make sure I do that anyway our slots of the show on cano says connection check green circle job applied for festival applied for I don't expect to hear back on the interview for the job for a few weeks more because stuff be slow.
 I'm pretty sure will will be on stage in October the committee is figuring out where has up that's awesome I cannot wait and I'm looking forward to the the bootleg album to make it to my door just you know how to reach me for my address and things absolutely I hate our blue dragon of the show sky has a connection check of a blue heart which we all know is really green.
They successfully celebrated the number of years of their life most closely approximating a positive integer now if I was a math nerd I would know what that meant instead I'm just going to say happy birthday.
 Our all of the show Kate says connection check sorting is a green circle started sorting the everything in my room of sorting all my clothes and getting really old ones that are never worn which feels great also started the sorting of some of the other stuff which will be an ongoing project the CV portfolio and website task is also a green circle I'm still in prep I'm still in the prep stage for this nothing finished yet but I did still.
 I'm starting as my connection required I got a list of images that need tweaking that I'm working on through the moment so making progress and then long term fall up has got my results for my resubmission yesterday past it this time around got an overall grade of a merit for the masters I don't know what that means but it's down fancy though keep reading because they'll tell you all about it hey hey.
 You shouldn't interrupt me i'm sorry i'm so sorry please forgive me can you forgive me i'm sorry i'm sorry forgive you even with them capping the resident grade at the past mark possible grades are past merit and distinction okay I like it this all sounds cool and also merit for the masters I still say that's the it just sound fancy to me it does it sounds like.
you have a parade coming before and after you with like extra the super fancy long you know horn with the flags that hang off of it merit for the masters.
Visualizing that and it said we're going to move on to the nameless of the show Robert was a connection check of a green square we are eight days till the wedding all seems to be the best.
All seems to be locked in woo woo woo oh my gosh so by the time the next episode comes it'd be completely new person you'll be married.

Yes for sure alright for reals now the final conductor of this episode is from Scott or guitarist of the show green circle we are very close to being completely unpacked it's starting to feel like home.
 Yeah having been here a year we are not unpacked so I'm very jealous and excited for you so well done Scott you I was going to throw the shade out there but instead I will just share a very wonderful message that this month is September which means it is childhood cancer awareness month and for the fourth consecutive year the relay FM community is rallying together in again to support the life saving.
 Of St Jude's children's research hospital finding cures and saving children did you know that it is estimated that more than 400,000 children worldwide develop cancer each year and nearly half of them are never diagnosed in the United States more than four out of five children survive cancer but in many developing countries that statistic is reversed you're then one out of five.
Diagnose with cancer will live the most significant predictor of whether a child will survive cancer is where the child lives that's why in March of 2018.
St Jude became the first and only world health organization collaborating center for childhood cancer the goal of the WHO global initiative for childhood cancer is to raise the survival rate of six common childhood cancers to 60% by 2030.
Last December St Jude in the World Health Organization launched the global platform for access to childhood cancer medicines it aims to provide free chemotherapy medicines in the next few years as to as many as 120,000 children around the world with cancer.
 Childhood Cancer Awareness Month is an opportunity for us to come together to fight against childhood cancer and together we can make a big impact this year you can support relay FM for St Jude campaign in multiple ways is always we invite you to make a donation donors who make an individual gift of 60 dollars or more will receive a digital bundle including a wallpaper and macOS screen saver pack.
Donors who make an individual gift of a hundred dollars or more will receive a set of stickers in addition to the digital bundle. If your employer offers a matching gift program then fill out the form at st Jude dot org slash relay to have that match also credited to the campaign.
 And new for this year if you want to get more hands on you can now start your own fundraising campaign to help us reach our goal while earning exclusive relay FM merch fundragers who raise a one dollar or more will receive an exclusive st Jude limited edition of the relay FM challenge coin and fundragers raising 250 dollars or more will also receive a unique desk mat featuring the cartoon heads.
Of the relay FM co founders which I hope is banging in the chat right now please go to that that's your role is messed up. Please go to st Jude dot org slash relay to donate and to find more about fundraising.
Mark your calendars for September 16th for the fourth annual podcast the phone relay FM co founders Stephen Hackett and Mike Hurley will be back together at st Jude's campus to host an eight hour variety show featuring many relay FM hosts and special guests that's September 16th from 12 to 8 p.m.
US Eastern time at twitch.tv slash relay FM once again please go to st Jude dot org slash relay to learn more and donate. Let's cure childhood cancer together and one of the amazing new ways is with the sub campaigns right now.
I'm so excited for them they're incredible there are currently 94 sub campaigns that all go straight to st Jude and a community that started right here in the relay FM switch on discord has created a widget.
 In an app for the fundraiser and it should be released I think by the time this publishes if not I apologize please forgive me but one of the cool things that comes that is coming down the pipe is a discover a random fundraiser button and so I thought on this episode I would click that button and find a fundraiser and donate it to it.
So what do you think Jay do it do it. All right here we go. Let's see what is yeah it's on test flight will get the link thank you Tony for sending that I don't know how it all works.
It's all way too smart for me but that's okay because I have incredible people that do the learning and knowing for me.
So I'm going to hit the button and we're going to donate to Eric Linders fundraiser and is it the fundraiser I will put that link in the show notes so if you want to donate to the randomized.
So I'm going to put that link in the show notes and I'm going to put that link in the show notes and I'm going to put that link in the show notes so I can do it. I'm going to put that link in the show notes and I'm going to put that link in the show notes so I can do it.
 Donations but of course I'm just going to keep it open on my phone and and donate after we record because I'm a professional and we're going to talk about some exciting things instead of listening to me fill out the form and put in numbers and information and stuff because that doesn't sound like very good podcasting but who knows who knows instead let's put oh good idea put it in the chat.
Thank you Jumbo for being very very smart. I'm going to put in the chat here real quick. Well Kathy is putting it in the chat. I just want to say that I am happy to be a part of an organization that does this every single year.
I mentioned last year during the podcast the phone that we had a family friend that received you know health you know help from St.
 Jude and sadly their daughter was the one in five in the US that didn't make it but they were still so very thankful of the time that they got to have with their daughter and when I mean that of when you think about that you it's really hard to be thinking about working and paying bills and doing all of those things while also trying to figure out hospital bills and medical bills and all the suffer tests and chemo and things like that while also dealing with the emotional stress of a sick child as a parent I can definitely understand at least the sick child part but I can't imagine the pain and and that they had to go through but I do know that it would have been a lot of work.
I do know that it would have been significantly harder and they were ever so thankful of the time that they got to have at St. Jude because it allowed them to focus and cherish those moments that they had with their little one.
 Again it's it's always sad when when these things don't end the way that you want them to but it is amazing that there are organizations that take the ability to give you that time that you have that time that you will cherish and that you will hold on to forever instead of having to worry about that among so many other things so this is definitely organization that I support my wife and I usually make matching donations so we will be doing that.
And also I'm happy that Conduroy this year is going to be hoping to do something special as well in support of this. Yeah you may notice on the fundraising page when we reach $150,000 raised we will be having a conduit co-working hour.
So we have a couple things planned but a little sneak peek to our conduit listeners here is you're going to hang out with Jay and I while we work now that may not sound like it's exciting.
We'll see but the biggest thing is is we're going to be hanging out together and working on whatever project we want to do will it'll be a little bit of a Pomodoro style so we're going to be doing a little work.
Doing some stretching together or maybe at like just a mindfulness or something we don't know it's up in the air but you can hang out with us we'll have it on a Twitch account.
I'm pretty sure it's going to be on J's because he knows how to work all of the magic and we're really excited for this and it might be a test drive for something fun coming in the future too. Maybe Kathy can use that time to get those boxes taking care of. Okay listen.
Yes except that would be hard to do on a stream in that you know what we'll figure it out later it's fine it's fine. So Jay we had to spoke on the phone to each other twice yesterday.
Yeah and that was really fun and one of the things that we did was trying to figure out what to talk about on this episode huh.
Yeah and and the topic we came to was one that that was interesting because I think it I think it'll mean something different to everybody as we as we kind of mentioned this is like the season of folks getting married.
 This is the season of people going back to school is the season of people launching a book and for me this is the season of being with my parents in Georgia right now hanging out with them for the next month and also trying to work as we thoroughly consider the idea of relocating back to the state for you know family personal.
 Family personal reasons but trying to get all of the pieces of the puzzle put together and when I tell you that it is hard to like figure out how do I even record a podcast as I'm you know sharing this this house with a bunch of other people and all these things happening luckily I knew that there was a a pen addict you know nearby for me to say hey hey friend can I get a broke your.
Oh, you're. That that one of being a big help but before we jump into all my stuff Kathy what is this season for you this is the season of back to school back to busy schedules and busy weekends with other things getting planned but also like a lot of big changes in my personal.
 Business coming in making things we talked about it a little bit before on a previous episode where I talked about like my solo retreat and concentrating on unicorning and so it's now in the implementation process so so kind of a season of change a season of like foundational rebuilding almost and just kind of learning and growing the way that it always is but it feels very feels very difficult right now feels kind of scary to to be doing the things and so I think a future topic will be like this this feeling of fear that I currently have.
 But it's fine and we're not going to talk about it right now and so we're going to kind of talk about what like how to transition to a new season and whether that is a like fall season and winter spring and summer or if it's a longer period of time or even a shorter period of time you know it's kind of helping to identify it as like what this is and whatever way that works so if you want to have I've seen a lot on like Instagram people calling it their era so in the like the Taylor Swift mode of you know this is my reputation era this is my 1984 era type of a vibe and I like that too but we kind of wanted to talk about like that awareness and how to give yourself permission to live in that and not and do your best to not let it overwhelm you because because change is hard and change is difficult who sky made a point so most new iPhone season which it will be iPhone season when this episode publishes so that's cool.
I think it'll be the day before pre-orders go go out. I'm definitely and I think about that too of it could be a season of new things coming into your life in terms of new technology.
 It's interesting that Kathy if you remember most of this year has been me waiting for the fanciest of technologies to arrive and then it got here and I got to use it for like a month and a half two months and then now it's back at home and I'm here now that being said I do have a fancy new laptop but it's not the most powerful list of the most powerful list of devices so it is you know an m2 MacBook Air and you know I did I tried to prepare for this being in this exact moment when I made that purchase it was very much me saying I know that I'm going to be traveling I'm going to be gone and I either have to be be okay with lugging around a Mac studio and a 5k monitor which that that's not no that's that's not the answer ever.
 But I instead said okay let me get a device that I can use that I know is going to be my on the road device for the next year or two and I was thinking about that in the preparation stage do I get the you know less than a terabyte or do I get the terabyte do I get the extra ram do I get all these things and in my case the answer was yes on a lot of those but it wasn't because of you know me just wanting the best of devices it was oh no this is going to have to be the big device for me for at least a month if not more right because of you know just getting things transition back and forth into systems is always hard but there was also the idea of being open and you know with my teammates and say hey I know that normally my team you know normally we've been doing this I've been live streaming like three times a week right up until this and it was like it was all for the hey I'm going to be leaving soon but I want to make sure that I'm putting these systems in place now so that when I go on the road that live show that we do still has to happen so how do I make sure that that's the best possible live show that I can do and that when I get back to you know my house in California I can say cool let's just continue running like like we never missed a step right right yeah because this is a huge upheaval of your day today and yet you are still expected to function yeah the world doesn't care where you are you have to do your things and you're you're really you're lucky that the situation was able like it benefited from getting to do that prep work you know you could it wasn't last minute you weren't you didn't buy the Mac studio and then suddenly oh by the way you have to go now and use an old laptop that barely functions to be able to you know do your work while you're gone for an entire month you know this these things are it's interesting the difference that being able to plan for something as opposed to having it dropped in your lap can can adjust almost even just adjust your mental state like I don't know about you Jay but if I can know something is coming I'm more ready for it when it comes to use yeah and it's easier to process it's easier to take advantage of it's easier to you know have it have a good outcome because you're not as scared out of your mind because you don't know what it is or you don't know how to handle it you don't know what to how to manage it.
I think it helps that you do travel a lot not for this long but being able to kind of have an idea of being able to what you need to function at a different location is not new to you.
Yeah it's it's definitely a feeling of I've prepared for this I it's it's like practice before the game like that's that's the feeling right now is that you are going to be able to plan for all the things we have flash flood warnings this entire week so like that was not in my plan.
But I would much rather be able to spend more time working around you know water being very very high than having to do like oh I don't even know where I'm going to work now and like all these other things and on top of that the rain just keeps falling so it it seems helpful.
That the thought that did go into it made made life so much easier and and I want to ask you you know it's it's the time of going back to school. Give me like one good and one maybe different look at what what the season means for you.
Yeah so one of the one of the things that change is that because tiny soup catches the bus at 7 a.m. I have to make sure that they're awake.
You know it's a basic it's a basic thing there they're 13 they're pretty good at you know waking up with their their alarm and stuff but I still have to make sure that they are actually awake.
Because they need they can't miss school and their bus comes and it's not a huge in position most of the time if I do need if they do miss the bus and if I do need to take them to school but I would really rather not have to deal with that.
Especially if I have things meetings or something in the morning so what that means is I actually have to get out of bed at 6 as opposed to what I have been doing the summer which between 6 and 7 at some point I'm awake and I'm out of bed and I'm and I'm you know doing the things.
And one of the one of what this means is starting my morning routine earlier and actually having started earlier instead of just turning off my alarm and then I'll get up when I get up.
 But I'm going to be working towards continuing to solidify my morning routine to be more purposeful so that I have more time to myself in that morning me time because I'm awake at 6 so it will allow me to embrace the fact that I absolutely have to get out of bed at 6 and own it and do all of the things that I do.
Now that I have that that time before I get started to work so instead of just jumping in and saying oh I am. It's you know 6 am I've woken up tiny soup it's time to sit at my desk and work I'm going to use that hour.
 To do more things for me in the morning so I don't know exactly what that looks like yet but it'll be really interesting to transition that one of the good things also is the fact that having a solid day to day plan like every day this is going to happen during the week you know every Monday every Tuesday every Wednesday.
 Having that solid in place helps plan things a little bit differently a little bit better but it also gives my child the structure that they really need to thrive so we're all excited and nervous about this new season and and ready for it to kind of go and be here because we did a lot of prep work too not quite ordering.
Not quite ordering new computers level but figuring out like starting alarm clocks starting you know timing issues and whatnot thankfully their bus gets here about 15 minutes later than it did last year so they get a little bit of more sleep but yeah it's kind of nice.
 I also love that for you I know that like when when the the tiny soup is doing all of the things that's when the season start up and you really get to flex that like again those photography skills and like the tick tocking things and like all the other amazing work that you do like for the collective group of I mean with the all because spot.
I don't know I don't know. The chicken noodle you got tomato and split P. Yes split P's over in the corner.
I don't know what's happening there but I feel like those seasons I mean as as stressful as they may be or as they may get like I think focusing on all what are all the bad things that could happen. I don't know if I'm not going to be able to do it.
Like isn't really the way to do it I think that there's a lot of good I know that a pod pod friend of the show find my dragon. I love it and go listen to that show because that show is great.
But one of the things that came up was like seeing the difference between the first year for the smaller or the younger dragon and the continuing year and how they differed and what was coming up.
I've been talking about all the unexpected as this thing to prepare for and you know be worried about and have gone the front of your mind.
But I also think that there's a level of what exciting can come from the unexpected I got my hair done like I like my hair looks I mean it looks about it looks different.
 But it looks great and like that wasn't a thing that I was planning to do and I'm like now I'm excited for how the rest of the trip is going to go because it's like it's already starting off really well and I look forward to not just the you know what happens if a tree falls and hit my mom's car while driving or something.
Because then I've got two problems one is a really mad mom. Yes. What are all of the good things that are going to come from you know doing this and doing this the way that we've done in like like you said a month is a long time. Yeah.
It's the longest that like our little ones been on vacation our little one flew for like the second time and she wasn't scared at all. Oh, yeah. She was so excited to fly and it just warmed my heart because now that means that if I go to places and there's short trips. I can like take her with me.
So yeah. Like that just opens the door for so many things so like while it is a season that required a lot of preparation. There's like so many wonderful unexpected things that that also.
Yeah, it's also the season for the podcast a thon which is amazing and I'm super excited but I'm also behind what I normally would like to do. So last year was the first year that I did the founders quiz game thing while I'm doing it again this year on September 6th from what 12 to 8 p.m.
Pacific or Eastern time. Yeah, yeah, I definitely remembered that. The problem is is I don't have the questions yet don't tell Stephen. So I probably should get on that.
I probably should make the Google form like I did last year because oh my goodness the discord had tons of great questions and being able to use them to guide. I know Kate. I'm sorry.
I'm going to use your incredible historian skills again hopefully I know you're super busy though so we'll see we'll get it figured out it'll be fine. It's fine everything's fine it's going to be fine.
Yeah, I I'm nervous I'm less nervous than I was last year because last year was the first year that I did it. But doing it this year it's almost it's it's more scary in a different way because I haven't. Because I don't have the fear I'm also not as prepared if that makes sense so.
I mean I know what my connection is going to be now so it's fine everything's fine everything's fine it's going to be fine. So speaking of I'll never mind this is your show you. Are we ready to say way I wasn't sure if there's anything else you wanted to chat.
I mean I I'm really interested in hearing what other folks's seasons of are and kind of what they're excited about what they're trepidacious about you know it. I think that no matter what the thing that I've just consistently learned is everything is scary.
Yeah eventually it becomes less scary it's still scary it's just slightly less scary. And there's a great you know the great way to solve that is to just go through it and try to have as much fun in the process because it'll help you forget how scared you are going into it.
Yeah that's that's definitely a feeling that I am I am trying to live more and more each day of.
Everyone keeps saying all these scary things that involve my name and I go well I guess that this is the season of me just showing off I guess I don't know I'm going to do whatever I do and I'll be terrified the entire time but so far I've had nothing but fun.
Yay terrified the whole time but having nothing but fun that sounds like a great great ending or goals like a good roller coaster yeah yeah I'm right the conduit our connectors are terrified the entire time.
Oh my goodness love it I love it all right so what I think you're saying is when our conductors give us their.
 Connection checks maybe they should tell us what season of life they're in as well yes do that do that yeah yeah if you if you want to make it cortex style the season of blah blah blah blah blah blah like that's that's fine if you just want to say you know I'm not into that whole thing but this has been a moment of of this happening for me then I think that's cool to yes absolutely if you don't like seasoning that's cool each.
 You can absolutely enjoy your plan chicken but no no season chicken I'm sorry yes but don't wash it don't yeah don't wash your chicken yeah season it yes all right Jay what is your connection for the next fortnight to make sure all the conductors have more than salt and pepper for seasoning on their chicken that might be difficult.
 I read something that makes me okay I'm not I'm not going to ignore ignore that comment yeah you're good okay my goal is to I want to I've got some big projects for the rest of the year that don't involve me speaking that much but one of them is me speaking and it is me giving my first keynote presentation when I return from my trip I won't have that done because I'm only doing well I'm not doing half I don't know I don't know how half the work all the I'm working with someone else on that my connection will be to have started on all three of the big projects by the next con.
I'm not giving a I'm not giving a how much just just start them because knowing me I will I will push myself to do more and more than I had planned and I think if I just start that'll be the biggest help there. I think that's a great idea now write that in the connection thing.
So I give I know I'm so needy but this way I don't have to listen through to the episode and write it in the document because I forgot what you were going to do. No of course not I would never do such a thing instead we're going to distract.
Shani over here my connection is going to be to have the best time at the podcast the phone how about that. Because everything's going to be great. Sorry I'm writing down the projects that I'm supposed to be doing. But not in the document are you using one did you steal Brad's flavor or flavor.
I'm writing it down my notebook so that I can have it for myself because let's be honest we're not opening this book in until we have to. It's true. Oh wow Tony that actually looks good.
I'm going to send that maybe buy it for my child who we did so there's the the bean booze old game with the with the terrible and good flavor jelly beans. There is now a version of it where they're super super spicy. And the first one my kid tried was the hottest one.
And so we have actually found something that is too spicy for them. Thank you. Is that it? Is that a yay? Right. I mean I don't care either way but it's anytime they like have something spicy or sour it's like oh whatever like blah this isn't spicy at all.
And I'm over here where black pepper is sometimes too spicy for me. Yes Tony. Tani soup is a major spice fiend like they will say any talkies like their bread. I don't know. That's not even a spicy thing that's just the talkies are bad. Yeah. So I was very excited. I'm ignoring you there.
I was very excited to find something that it was too spicy for them so I can't wait. I can't wait to hear about all these connections. Yeah so would you like to start? Yeah. Our soprano of the show Deborah says next connection so a custom cross body bag.
To carry on the plane that has the exact pockets I need for carry on items like an iPad, Kindle, iPhone, wallet, etc. That sounds awesome. And now I just wondered is Etsy like a play on the word etc? Sorry I had an age 2 moment there. Etsy etc.
Is it like the same thing? Because my first mental thought was like oh you should do that and put it on Etsy and I will buy one. And then I was like wait I'm giving people work. I'm not supposed to do that. Don't give people work unless they ask for work ideas.
All right next up our hydration of the show water bride. There you're new connection is to ask myself and others what do I slash you need? If I can provide it in a sustainable and reasonable response well responsible manner within my boundaries do so.
I love this because so often our connections are very internally focused and this is a way that can really help other people. So I love I love that so much. I'm so excited and I can't wait to hear. Your connection check. I'm then our training enthusiast of the show.
Ralezy says new connection enjoy and make the most of the holiday. Decompress then back to planning and away my quality assurance vision for my new employer. Okay you got this. I look forward to hearing about your TPS reports. And I hope that they will be especially more fun with your new stapler.
Yes just don't steal it from someone else's desk. All right our Oracle of the show. So they're new connection. I'm working on boundaries and systems so I don't feel like I have to be in work mode every minute.
The less good part of self-employment connection is to keep figuring out my system so that I can survive a very busy time. Sounds like you're in a busy season of life now. So and instead of letting it be overwhelming you are embracing it and using it to set up your foundational systems.
So I'm super proud of you and I can't wait to hear how it goes. And then our the last to follow the show. Founders man you had to warm up for that word. That's like. I know you got to. Yes it's good word though. Brain dumped my someday maybe is Jay and I can have it out someday. There you go.
And find a meaningful home for them. I have a deferred dates page that all of them go on to and by all of them I mean there's only one thing on there that I put on there in the last six months.
Anyway this is a largely and this is largely inspired by a co-op reading of Barbara shares refused to choose organized by the incredible Maddie that some of us are doing in the relay FM switch on discord. You can find by going to. And become a member for five dollars a month to support conduit.
It's seriously such a cool and welcoming community and you'll be glad you joined. Yes this is an endorsement and a member plug inside a shout out inside a future connection. They won't all be like this or will they. Yeah. Zine. Oh ponder is you are clearly fitting in just five.
Our slot of the show on canoe. Their next connection is get back on the fitness train the heat of summer and job busyness made me lazy here. Going to aim for at least eight workouts in the next fortnight. You can do it. Does our training enthusiasts of the show run the fitness train? Oh maybe.
I see some connections happening. Our blue dragon of the show sky says simple survive the next two weeks of school without burning out. I endorse that. Mostly they need to do this by learning when to let themselves rest but also might consider a change in the system.
Oh sounds like you need to do a system check. I love it. Amazing. All right our owl of the show Kate. Their new connection continue both assorting in my room and the work updating my CV portfolio and website.
Basically the same as last time except not the same as last time because you know now have a. Hold on let me scroll up. You now have a merit for the masters so it's very different. A masterful merit at most.
The nameless of the show Roberts has be patient for the wedding day do not let the what if stress me out. Trust all the planning and help from our loved ones will make a big the make the big day go off of it. Out eight hitch.
Well I almost butchered that pack for the honeymoon and also make sure as much as possible is left moving for our house and renovation so I leave all the worries here while we're away. That that is excellent. Yes absolutely. Enjoy the wedding. Enjoy the honeymoon and.
Get put think about all that stuff when you get back. Definitely. All right our hello of the show Jombo. Their new connection check is to relax and enjoy some time with his wife.
How many times have you made my wife jokes because really now is the time to just lean in and get them all out of the way before it's overwhelming and you get tired of it. I'm already tired of it. Never never.
And lastly our guitarist of the show Scott says new connection the 5k is coming up time to get back to training. Might I suggest having a conversation with a friend. I did a I did a 5k walk while on the phone with someone.
I don't know if you're walking or running if you're running conversation might be hard if you're walking a good phone call can get you there.
 Absolutely and if you would like to submit a connection become a new conductor you can do so on Twitter by tweeting at conduit FM using the hashtag my conduit or in the relayed out FM switch on discord with question mark my conduit you can also hang out in the show follow up channel and if you start the message with our conduit image it will automatically all get put into our magical spreadsheet by the incomparable maddie fee.
So go ahead and visit relayed out FM slash conduit to become a member if you would like to become a member of conduit. I think we've promoted membership just a couple times. And so now that that's over hey Jay did we conduit? We conduit. In fact I think we started a whole new season of conduit.
I can't wait for the next time that we can absolutely conduit. Okay I'm out of stuff so I'm just going to leave it there. We conduit.
