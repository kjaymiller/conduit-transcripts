From RelayFM, you're listening to Conduit, the show where we condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that's here for the vibes and that includes you. This episode is brought to you by Claude from Anthropic.
I'm Kathy Campbell and Jay is off running around doing Jay things. And so I brought in a friend of mine who some of you may recognize. It's Tiff Arment. Hi, Tiff. Hey, Kathy. Hello, all the people. It feels so weird to be talking to you without a drink in my hand. Oh my gosh, I know.
And without like kind of a smutty movie on. Yeah, I don't know. You know what? Somehow we're going to have... Do people know about that here? Yes, yes. Yes, people I have definitely talked about specifically in this season when Twilight commentary comes out and like people discuss it.
And I'm just like, oh yeah, best commentary ever is clearly the incomprehensible ones. That is like my legacy that I'm so happy and proud of. And yeah, we need to schedule another one, I think. I think. Yeah, I think we're primed. We're ready. Yeah, yeah. We've got a couple on the list. But yes.
Oh, Stephen. Stephen, the Discord says, yeah, either watch a movie or start playing low def. We haven't played. I have low. There has not been a low def in a very long time. There has not. And I know someone that needs to get their butt in gear and make one of those. Yeah. Yeah. Let's. Yes.
Let's poke him. Let's poke that fire. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Let's do it. Let's do it. I'm sure it's super easy. Like. Oh, yeah. I'm sure he has tons of time on his hands. Yeah. Absolutely.
Well, I still think he should just pull the letters or like the words from the first game version of it because none of us remember what anything means except for like Monty. Monty will pull stuff out of his. Yeah. You can't trust that. Like he remembers. No. Yeah.
But like me, I don't remember anything ever. So, you know, we could we could just play an old game and it would be brand new. No. Well, he definitely needs to make a new one for sure. Yeah. Because that's one of the what's one of the best shows. I freaking love it. It's so good.
It's my favorite game that no one plays with me. Rude. Rude. I know. So rude. So rude. Well, this past week in the discord, there were lots of conversations. We had new products kind of teased around Apple as well as an update to the iOS that made it not glass whatever.
Like, I don't I don't listen. I'm not. You were just saying words. I was so distracted. I'm still thinking about low definition. That's a way better story than like talking about what happened to the discord. Ah, discord. Come on, Steve. Come on. Yeah. Yeah. Quick. Let's text them together.
One, two, three. Go. Go. Yeah. No, the discord is so much fun, though. We love it. And there are lots of fun things, especially when new stuff comes out. But also we ended we closed up the St. Jude campaign, which was fun.
Raising more than seven hundred fifty thousand dollars this year, which we're so happy for. And then last week in the co-working, which happens in the off weeks of Conduit. Where we sit and hang out with our superconductor friends. We discuss some medical things, some chaos in the developer world.
And then lots of talk about the weather as well. If any of those things sound like fun, you can visit. I am a superconductor dot com to become a member today. That's letter I, letter M, letter A, superconductor dot com.
Next, we have a couple little bits of follow up from some of our incredible conductors. First up from the of the show. Jay's speech from our last episode about justified imposter syndrome hit him so hard because that's exactly how he feels in the current job.
He says, I truly don't understand half of what is being said around me at work because I'm a software guy who's been thrown into a hardware heavy role. Every day I'm pushing my way through learning what things mean because I don't care and didn't need to care.
Oh, sorry, because I didn't care and didn't need to care about those things until now. Things have definitely gone more smoothly when I just own the fact that I don't know things and need help. I think that last little bit especially is such like the key part is being able to ask for help. I know.
Well, Tiff, you needed help setting up your your podcasting thing and then he freaking left. So like he helped me. I got text messages, messages from Marco. He helped me walk me through. We did a FaceTime. We had I didn't tell him how sticky my hands were. But that's fine.
Listen, he's not going to listen to this. It'll be fine. He's not going to know. He'll never know. Yeah. But like asking for help can kind of there's something really powerful in being able to ask for help when you need it.
And I think acknowledging that imposter syndrome is not necessarily a bad thing, but it also can be really helpful to know when you don't know something. And like being able to to to to get that support that you need to then learn it.
And then, of course, you have to remember the things that you've asked for, because asking for help for the same thing multiple times. That's where it can get annoying. And then from the nameless of the show nameless. He says, I wanted to give a shout out to the community as a whole.
With this new role, I realized that this is another milestone I can track via a conduit episode number. The support from you guys and the rest of the conductors has been an amazing gift. Two graduations, a wedding, career moves. And now this. I can literally map my life through this show.
It's kind of incredible when I think about it. I love being a part of this community. You two are spectacular. Nameless. I just appreciate you being a part of this community so much. It's such a joy to see you in our co-working sessions and hear the journeys.
Even if, you know, we don't know your name, except we do when you send us a message. But we don't remember it because that's the one thing about like having having a nickname is like my brain will just be like, no, that's your name now. It doesn't matter what legal names you have going on.
You're nameless to me forever and always, except for Mocha. Mocha the dog definitely has a name because she deserves it. All right. So Tiff, we do this one good thing. What is one good thing that has kind of happened in the last week, two weeks, something like that? Hmm.
Good thing in the last two weeks, one week. We closed out the first season of our restaurant. That's a good thing. Yes. That's a very good thing. We didn't ruin it. We didn't burn it to the ground. Yay! So it's all very, very good. That is a very, very good thing indeed.
I can't wait to talk a little bit more about that in the topic part of things. It's going to be very exciting. My one good thing is, you know, my kid had the best homecoming that they've ever had.
And I feel like we together were able to find like the perfect dress that they ended up borrowing from a friend. But we did find one from Goodwill that would have worked, that it's then going to be their winter formal dress instead. We got some special nails. We got like it.
But most importantly, like the people that they hung out with for the dance was the best.
And so kind of being able to support my kid through that journey of like what are friends? How do you like choose who to spend time with? And that sort of thing, I think, really helped me feel really good about my parenting right now. Just kind of like those little pieces.
As kids get older and are less of a potato, you're just like, oh, okay. It's harder to parent than just make sure they eat and sleep and whatnot. And so finding those little bits of good things is always really fun. And now for our connection check.
So my connection check in the last fortnight was to set up my desk for the PC that I now have to do work on. Tiff can kind of see it on my video right over here. I have a whole other desk with a keyboard and monitors and all of that. And I have now been doing PC work, which is exciting.
Frustrating. Yeah, it's a little bit of a little bit of everything. But I really do like having a whole separate area to do it from because it helps my brain switch from using, you know, command C to control C.
Because like the location of the buttons or the keys and the keyboard are just a little bit different.
What are you doing over there? What are you PCing? I am working for a company that has a bunch of like security stuff that needs like PC connection things because they manufacture parts for the aerospace industry. Okay.
Which includes like, I don't know, special like certificates of, I don't know, I don't understand it. I just kind of do my thing. I don't need to understand the specifics. I was like, are we getting into some hardcore games? Are we going to get on some Steam? Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
My little Microsoft Surface laptop. Absolutely. Like, yeah, let's, let's, let's learn how to blow this baby up. I don't even know what the cool games are on Steam anymore. They're all cool games. It's all, it's all Hollow Knight right now. Or Silk Song. Oh, yeah.
Those are definitely names that I've heard about. Oh, my God. Yeah. Oh, my gosh. My kids got me playing Hollow Knight. Amazing. Okay. Amazing. Okay. It's a good thing. It's a good thing that I'm so angry at this game. Yeah. But I'm bonding with my child and he loves sharing it with me.
So that's a good thing. That's so sweet. I think that's a favorite. Yeah. I, I love. Sure. Here, that's for the fans. Yeah. You guys can, you know, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll get out there and get excited that I knew a thing from a game. Woo! Get good. You're such a gamer. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
So what did you do in the last two weeks? And obviously that's a very like targeted question. Like, what did you even do? But no, what's one thing that you were working on that you wanted to get done in the past two weeks that you did? You're talking to me. Yes, I'm talking to you.
Why did I feel like you were talking to the audience as a whole? Because I'm working at like, listen, I have a podcast voice and it's really hard to do when I'm looking at a face and not.
I'm like, wait, is, are you talking to someone behind me? Like you're not focused? What's happening? Who's back there? It's the ghost of hops. Hops is coming for the podcast. Oh, no. Wait, bring up my dead dog again. I'm sorry. How dare you? God, Kathy, you're so insensitive. I know. It's true.
Please forget me. Oh, gosh. Hops forgives you. He loves everyone. Okay, good. Okay. So you're asking me about. Your connection. I said my new, my good thing. I am. I am. I'm trying to follow you. I know. Okay. So I know it's. Yes. We are talking about the last two weeks. Yes. A project. Yes.
That I've been into. Yes. Okay. Yes. All right. So kind of connected to the main part of this episode, which is about how I had a brand new business this year and had a pretty substantial role in working at it and running it, which took away a lot of my creative time.
So since it has closed for the season, not because we ruined it or anything, it closed for the season. Like it always does every year. Like this isn't a new thing. This is normal. I have, I've had more time to myself to be creative and Halloween's kind of one of my favorite times of year.
So I have really poured myself into doing a bunch of spooky decorations and everything around the house. So like mostly outside, I am like, you know, making all these like swampy things. So like, cause we live in an area that's very wet all the time.
Like it's already kind of naturally swampy and soggy and like floods and all this stuff. Amazing. So I'm like, I'm going to lean into that and I'm going to do like this whole like abandoned swamp kind of Halloween decorations.
So I've been kind of pouring myself into that for the last two weeks and getting together all the little pieces and everything.
And even just now, like 10 minutes before the show started, I was out in the garage using great stuff to make like a fake tree with these spooky lanterns hanging from it and all this stuff. Like I have real trees, but for some reason I needed to make a fake one.
Well, yeah, of course, obviously it needs to be extra spooky. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. It just needed to look like real gnarly and fun. And I also really wanted to play with great stuff, which I've played with before in the past.
But if you don't know what that is, it's kind of like a spray foam that expands and then hardens. So you can like make all kinds of crazy shapes with it and shave it down or build it up. And so it's not like you're not supposed to touch it, but I'm going to get them all over my hands. Oops.
So now my hands look all old and gnarly, like the tree is going to. But yeah, it's just like a fun, cool little crafty project because I got tired of all the Halloweeny crap that's out there that everyone seems to have in their yard, which no hate to any of that.
It's just I wanted a more personalized crafty experience this year and I finally have time for it. So I'm leaning into it. Amazing. Amazing. I hope you'll share some photos with me. Yeah. I had to watch videos on how to corpsify a skeleton. Just super gross and fun.
I'm like, yeah, I can use my heat gun. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Use the tools. So good. So exciting. So good. It feels very good to be creative again, for sure. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. And I can't wait to dive into that a little bit more. All right. Let's hear from our conductors.
So the checklist enthusiast of the show, Mike, says, green checkmark, get ready for a trip to celebrate 10th anniversary of the first date with my wife. My wife and I had a great time celebrating our anniversary together. Incredible. Congratulations on a whole decade. That's amazing.
Erin M, connection checkmark. I finished the half marathon and finished with my body intact. It was fun and difficult and all the emotions. That's awesome. Half marathon is no joke. Yeah. No joke. Yeah. Our soprano of the show, Debo, says, connection check, green heart.
I contacted the landscapers about doing fall cleanup in our yard that we don't have the time or energy to do. You've heard me say, shout from the rooftops, like finding, having people to help things that you don't have the time or energy to do is magical.
And especially fall cleanup, getting rid of those leaves and not just throwing them in plastic bags. Win, win. So connection check. Oh, I'm supposed to say the emoji too, aren't I? Yellow circle. There you go.
That's, that's, that's, that's like, um, not yes, did it and not no, I failed or not failed, but like wasn't able to do it. It's like partial, partial completion. Okay. Connection check. Yellow circle. I've been working on the article. I was avoiding before.
Uh, I was, gosh, I'm terrible reading things for the first time. Um, so, uh, connection check. Okay. Connection check. Yellow circle. I've been working on the article. I was avoiding writing before, although I haven't finished it yet. Defeat that procrastination. Yes. Yes. Good job. Good job.
Both of you, both Soph and Tiff. You're just going to be like, I'm going to rerecord these. No way. This is, this is, this is perfection. Listen, we are practice the things that I read usually before, like a long time before reading things out loud. I'm a terrible reader. Are all here.
I think it's minor dyslexia. This is real. This is reality. We're not polished. We're, we're chill. Like mistakes get made and that's okay because how we get through it. Well, now I have to go back because Aaron, he got it. Okay. Okay. Aaron connection check. Green circle. Huh? Yeah. There we go.
I can edit that in. Put that back. Perfect. Perfect. I'm so ready. Okay. The Esperanto knitter of the show, Irisano says connection check, green check mark. I do still peek at the Steno keyboard every now and then, but the key caps are blank. So that doesn't really help.
I am on the road and did not bring my cheat sheet with me. So I'm doing my practice without it, which means I have succeeded with doing my connection check. It's slow, but fun. And I'm getting the hang of it. I know where the letters are, but still have to think a lot when typing words.
Hey, the fact that you can't see the letters and you're still doing the typing, that's really impressive. That is how you get that pattern, that practice. Irisano is doing Steno work and also doing it in Esperanto and English. So like, it's insane. It's absolutely killer. We're so excited.
I'm loving the journey that we're going on. I've already, I didn't say any of the, like the, of the show people. It's okay. It's okay. They'll forgive you. I have read for the identical twin of the show and the Oracle of the show. So far. I'm so sorry. You have this one. Ah, the ah of the show.
Yes. Ah, I'm getting this. I'm getting this. Connection check, yellow heart. Thanksgiving was lovely and delicious. My goal was to work out three times and I only did two, but I managed to get sick again. So I'm giving myself some leeway there.
Yes, definitely listen to your body as my trainer always says. He's like, listen to your body. Oh man, privilege. Oh God, your trainer, you're such a dip. It's okay. It's good. It's okay. It's okay. Anyway, yes. Listen to your body. It's super important.
That's as useful of a thing with working out, even if you miss a day. Our robotics engineer of the show, Aiden, says connection check, red heart. Guess who forgot he had no free time to work on projects over the past two weeks? Oh, well, I'll get them next time. Absolutely.
This is, there's still the time to do it. And you didn't fail. You just weren't able to do it yet. And that's okay too. One pair of shoes, shark of the show, Chris. My last connection was to get my car in the garage. Red X. It will be a work in progress for a while. Oh my gosh. I am so with you.
Getting cars into the garage has been a year, like two year long project and it's still not done. So I understand this pain. It's so much work. Oh my goodness. And then it rains and then you can't like move the stuff that's in the garage out to get it out. And then it's like, then you got it.
Oh, oh. It's. It's a whole thing. It's a whole thing. It is a whole thing. I feel you so much. I'm so glad I read this because my gosh. Yeah. I also X out my garage car. Yeah. Listen, can I suggest you go with a house that doesn't have a garage and then it's not a problem. Hey. Yeah.
So you have no. Oh, it's all. I know. Yeah. Listen, there's no wins. There's no wins. There's no wins here. Uh, our fish bear of the show. Fishy Kai says connection check a green circle with a strong man arm.
I didn't purposefully exercise on vacation, but I did get back into the workout routine really quick after. And that my dear is incredible. Well done. Anytime coming back from vacation and trying to getting like get back into any sort of routine. That's hard work. So well done.
Mike, the checklist enthusiast of the show. Previous connection. Green checkmark. Cleanup task. Backlog. I got a bunch of stuff done from my backlog, scheduled others and deleted some tasks that are no longer needed. Oh, that's such a good feeling. Go Mike. Killed it. Killed it, Mike. Woo.
Our chief Swifty of the show, Andrew, says connection check. I don't know. It's been too long, so I don't remember. But I've been doing and accomplishing a lot. And hey, that's all we can ask for. Well done. Ah, nameless. The nameless of the show. We heard from you earlier. Connection check.
Green circle. I feel like I finally have an understanding of what I am supposed to be doing at this new job. Ah, excellent. Immediate follow-up. I brought some things to make the... Oh, sorry. I brought... I brought... Yeah. I brought some things to make the office feel more enjoyable.
That is an excellent little hack. I love it. Our profane sleeper of the show, Mike, says connection check. Red stop sign. The initial scare is over with and wife is at home recovering from a tonsillectomy during which they think... We think they found the cancerous source.
Will no more and get a proper staging on the 31st. Do not approve of the tonsillectomy as an adult. I think even kids wouldn't necessarily approve of a tonsillectomy because that sounds like really... Like that...
The intimacy of your throat, like being able to, like, I don't know, swallow and eat and breathe. That sounds really, really scary. But I'm so glad this first part is done and that they think they got all of the cancer. That's incredible.
I hope you get some good news on Halloween and let us know either way, whatever. Because you know we're here for you. Tech podcast listener of the show, Pillix. That sounds good. Connection check red circle. I blame very cool conference from last weekend. Hey, very cool conference.
Sounds pretty cool. Very cool, actually. Cool. All right. Good cool. Yeah. Good cool. That's the new thing. Good cool. This episode of Conduit is brought to you by Claude Bianthropic.
Claude is a next generation AI assistant built by Anthropic and trained to be safe, accurate, and secure to help you do your best work. Now, I've been using Claude actually to help me plan my trip to Prague. So I am going at the end of November to Prague with my brother and friends.
And I wanted to make sure that I didn't miss anything this time because I didn't know, I don't know when or if I'll ever be back. And I'm super excited because I was like, you know what? Let's just see what Claude does. I've been trying this. Claude Anthropic has been sponsoring us.
Let me use this. Normally, what I would do is I would go into Pinterest and I would pick and choose a bunch of things from a bunch of different like blog posts. Maybe I'd go on TikTok and figure that out.
Well, I actually, by using Claude, I have a pretty good itinerary of things that I don't want to miss that I have not seen. So I've been in Prague before. I visited a few years ago for the Wheel of Time thing. And so some of these things I knew to look at.
But the really cool thing about using Claude is that not only did it pull some of the stuff that I knew about, there's a bunch of things that I had not seen anywhere before.
And because I told it the dates that I was going, it was able to pull things and tell me kind of some events that are happening. So I'm adding a classical concert to my list, as well as the fact that there are going to be a lot of Christmas markets happening, which just made me super excited.
I love the city of Prague. I love the buildings and I cannot wait to see some Christmas markets with it. And this is something that Claude gave me. Super easy.
I didn't have to spend a ton of hours searching through other people's blog posts, including reading, you know, 14 paragraphs about a story from someone's grandma about visiting Prague to then get the information that I wanted to see.
And so don't worry, I will let you know how it goes when I get back from my trip. Claude is the AI for minds that don't stop at good enough. It's the collaborator that actually understands your entire workflow and thinks with you, not for you.
Whether you're debugging code at midnight or strategizing your next business move, Claude extends your thinking to tackle the problems that matter. It doesn't just give you answers. It helps you think through the problem.
Claude's internal and external research capabilities go way deeper than basic web search. Think comprehensive, reliable analysis with proper citations for clients, turning hours of research into minutes. Claude can have contacts from your calendar, emails, and all of your go-to tools.

Our thanks to Claude for their support of this show and all of Relay. Yay! So, Tiff, I have been wanting to have you on this show for a while, and I'm so happy that you're finally here. But also, we have such good...
Like, I feel like the timing is really, really good, especially because you've finished out a season in the restaurant. You're finally able to kind of, like, get settled into, I don't know, who you are now. Like, what does this mean? What do I do with my hands? Like... I'm Italian.
I know what to do with my hands. Come on. Except you're a podcaster, and you're not going to flail them around like me because you are more of a professional than I am. Well, they're sticky right now, and I'm picking them. So that's... I'm occupied. Incredible, incredible, incredible.
So, yeah, let's kind of, you know, start wherever you want to start. We could start before you bought the restaurant or kind of, like, how you cultivated your role in that or, like, wherever you want to go. This is your time. I guess we should have, like, a tiny bit of follow-up backstory. Yeah.
A follow-up because I've never been here before. Backstory. Like, come on. Follow-up to your life. Yeah. It's just me. You're talking to me. Well, let's have a flashback. Can we have, like, a costume montage? Can we, like... Oh, yeah, yeah.
No, like a little getting stuff done montage where I'm really bad at it at first and I can't play hockey and then, like, I can. Yes, yes. Exactly. So after my hockey career took off, we decided... So anyway, we live in this beach community and we love it very, very much.
And our favorite, favorite restaurant went up for sale. And last summer, maybe the summer before, Marco and I... Yeah, it was last summer. Early last summer. Marco and I kind of looked at each other and we're like, should we do this? And I'm like, I think we should definitely do this.
And I turned to Marco and I said... I was like, look, if next year, if our favorite restaurant is gone or different, how are we going to feel? Like, are we going to feel like this community and, like, everything has, like, kind of changed for us? Because we're literally here all the time.
And we're like, yeah, that would be awful. It would be awful if someone bought this place and ruined it. Yeah. And we're like, can we do this? You know, can this be something? It's like, we finally had, like, a point in our lives where things have kind of calmed down.
We got the boy into, like, a new school. We just finished remodeling a house and we moved, like, we moved homes and then remodeled the home that we moved into because it was, like, falling apart. And so it's like, we finally had, like, ah, we could take a breather.
It's like, let's buy a restaurant. We've breathed enough. This will be easy, right? Like, I've had two good breaths. Let's, like, go absolutely bananas. Yeah, let's go bananas. We've never owned a restaurant before. We've never had employees before.
Let's, uh, let's look at how hard can it be? We didn't say that. What we really did was we went to one of the managers of the restaurant who's been there for, like, 20 years and we had a meeting with her and we were like, we literally can't do this without you.
Are you in? If you are in to manage this place and, like, run it, basically, we can do this. And if you can get the head chef to stay, we can definitely do this.
Because if she stays, if the head chef stays and the staff stays, because these two people are staying, we can, like, make this transition as smooth as possible and actually maybe make this work. Yeah. Right? Like, we could be kind of your...
The idea was, like, maybe we could be, like, the angel investors in this venture. Right? Um, but it turns out when you buy a restaurant and it has a liquor license or, like, you need to have a liquor license for a restaurant.
And, um, there's a whole bunch of other things that, like, restaurants need. Yeah. That, like, you need to be kind of super involved in. You can't just be like, here, money. Bye. That doesn't really work. Um, I mean, I guess it does if you have, like, met, like, if you want to pay management staff.
But, like, we did not, like, we had enough money to pay the people to, like, be there and running the restaurant. We don't have enough, like, it wasn't, we didn't have enough to pay, like, the level of make this run. Like, you know what I mean? Like, we had to be the background people.
Yeah, you, you still have, there's so much administrative and, like, organizing and managing and, like, like, yeah, like you were saying, like, licensing and stuff that is required that you don't think about. Right, right.
You, you know, you pay lawyers and you pay accountants and all that kind of stuff. But, like, they have, you know, other clients and you're just, like, a client. Like, so we would have needed to purchase the time of someone to actually, like, run, run, run it.
But, like, we also wanted the control, right? Like, we wanted to make sure that, like, things stayed the same or, like, we improved on certain dishes, like the nachos, which were terrible, but now they're great. Yay! So that was, like, my baby.
But, but yeah, so, like, it's, it's, we're like, oh, okay, like, we're doing, we're doing a lot of this. And, you know, Marco has a full career on his plate with being a full-time podcaster, with writing his app, which is basically, like, essentially funding this project.
Right? So he's completely busy. And he said to me, he was like, if we're going to do this, I can't be there. Like, I can't do this stuff. Like, we, I can, you know, help set it up and make connections and do this all.
Like, I could be there to fix the audio gear and all those kind of little projects that he was like, those were his pet projects. Right? Like, I did the nachos and he fixed the disgusting wires everywhere. Um, we all had our little happy place.
Uh, and so, like, getting into this new role in this new life, it's like, oh, okay.
Like, I have to kind of, where am I going to fit in all of this? Because we have our manager of the restaurant who will be in charge of, um, ordering all the stuff, ordering the food, ordering, um, everything for the bar, managing the staff, making sure, scheduling the staff, which is huge.
Um, she ended up taking over payroll for the staff, um, through our, like, um, through the, uh, like the TOAST system, the, um, the POS and everything, um, which stands for point of sale in case anyone wants to know that, which is something I had to learn. So, um, yeah.
So like, it was, uh, it was like, okay, so what, where is my role here? Um, what am I going to, you know, my, our manager had an assistant manager who helped, um, do all that stuff. We have a head chef, Marco's doing the wires and legal things.
Like getting our liquor license, um, which in both of our names, but still it's like a whole process getting a liquor license. And I started taking over all of the finances of everything.
So I started taking over like paying the vendors and making sure, you know, that all the money was in the accounts and going through like, okay, we got a shipment.
Do we get everything? How do we pay for it? Who do we owe money to? Um, and then also all the facilities management, like we have to go get the vents. It's cleaned in order to pass fire inspection. And then we have to go get the refrigerators turned on.
And then if the refrigerator isn't defrosting, right, we have to call up the fridge guy. And it's like, you know, oh no, our ice maker's not working. This is a catastrophe. Like call up the ice maker guy, which happens to be the same as the fridge guys. Just everything cold. Call that guy.
Like I had to learn all the guys and I'm sorry. Yes, they are all guys. It's like, you know, it's the atmosphere out there at the beach is like very old school. I got a guy. I found something off a truck, you know, like it's, it's a joke, but it's not a joke. Yes. Yes.
So, um, I had to meet all the guys and well, actually one of the funny little things is like being a woman in business, um, especially this kind of business where we just took it over from someone like from a family that has had this restaurant for 40 years.
And so, you know, you're talking about like the mayor of the town who owned this restaurant, who has known everyone his entire life, right? Like it, and ingrained in the community so deep and like, he's been great.
He's been helpful and, and supportive and he still comes by and steals Guinness from our taps and we're, we totally let him. But like, it's, it's just like, it's a different thing to, uh, if I'm meeting with a vendor, and they're like, can I talk to the owner? Right.
And they like, look at me and I'm like, I am the owner. And they're like, no, but I'm like, but no, really? And it's like, uh, they're like, really? And I'm like, I assure you, I know who I am. I'm definitely the owner.
You know what I mean? And like, I had this one person say like, you look too young. And he was like, can I ask you how old you are? And I'm like, this is so inappropriate. This is so inappropriate. But also, thank you. You think I look young. But also, oh my God. Yeah.
Like, I just, I did need to tell that story because of, yeah, I mean, come on. Obviously. I did feel a little good and I did tell everybody I knew.
So, um, but like, it ended up being like the, the business itself, you know, it's like me, um, Juliet, who's our, our manager and LT, who is our assistant manager. So it's essentially like all run by kind of young women. You know what I mean? Yeah. Which is like, great. That's amazing.
Like, it's such a different thing for the, for the place that we're in. Um, but like, it's, that was like a, a whole new experience of like trying to find a way to get respect in that way and like be taken seriously.
Because like now it's like, okay, if the auto chlor guy who's like our, we get, have like an industrial dishwasher and needs to be filled with certain chemicals and they check it and it's just like, oh, we rent it.
It's again, it's all these like little nuanced things that I had to learn about all the facilities and everything. So I'm handling all that.
So, and it's like, okay, you know, you have to talk, make sure you talk to the auto chlor guy and talk to this person, talk to that person, like manage all of these little moving pieces all over the place. And that completely consumes everything. Like it, it does.
And I, I did not, I worked probably a third as hard as Julie did during the year because she is literally running all the day-to-day stuff and I'm just making sure everyone has the money behind them that they need to have.
And we're not like late on payments and we, you know, get dinged on our liquor license and all those kinds of fun things. Which did happen.
We went through like a whole crazy thing in the middle of the summer where we had a temporary liquor license and they were, they were taking money from the account to like pay for things like automatically. And then when we got our real liquor license, they stopped doing that.
And they're like, you now have this grace period where you can wait for like a month and not pay it. And then you have to pay a month later. And I'm like, I don't want a grace period.
I'm like, can I just continue doing what I was doing? I thought you were taking, I thought you were just taking money from my account. We set up this whole thing, this auto pay and all this stuff. And then I'm just sitting there like, do, do, do.
Why isn't this money leaving my account yet? Do, do, do. Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting. And they're like, boop, you're late. You're late on your payments. Oh my gosh. What? This isn't how I want to run a business. This looks so bad.
But it was like, it's like little things like that that pop up and they're like, oh, this is just the way we do this. I'm like, what do you mean? This is the way. Don't you want money? Yeah. Don't you want, don't you want our money for the things that we bought? Like, can you just take it? Thanks.
That'd be great. But no, they're like, oh, we don't want to overdraft you. I'm like, you didn't have any problem overdrafting us. Right. You know, the theory of overdrafting us with the temporary license. Right. So whatever. But we figured it out.
You know, like there was little bumps and things like that, you know, through the summer, but nothing catastrophic. Everything kind of like went pretty smoothly. But yeah, it is a whole new world of figuring out how this all runs and the wonderful silver lining of it all.
We just had like our kind of wrap up meeting with all the management yesterday and we were there for like three hours, like all just having lunch together. It was great. And not just having lunch.
We were like talking about the entire year, everything, you know, what we would want to change for next year and how everything went. And we just all work so well together. Like everyone listens. Everyone's calm. Everyone.
It's like not like one of those crazy restaurant kitchen shows that you see where like people are yelling at each other. Like our even our kitchen crew like is not like that. Everyone's like, hey, like, yeah. OK. Sometimes people will get upset with each other when we're in the weeds.
But like otherwise, it's like it's a happy kitchen. People are laughing and making jokes. And like it's, you know, every like everyone is kind of kind to each other and thoughtful. And we give each other the benefit of the doubt. If something doesn't work out, you like assume like us.
Assume positive intent. Yeah. And it's like it's also it's working with incredibly competent people. Like I have absolutely zero doubt in our manager's ability, like her handling of everything. I don't even have to question like anything that she is up to because it's all the up and up.
We like share everything that we can. And but at the same time, it's just like if I know if something went wrong, it went wrong for a good reason. And it's just like, oh, hey, what you know, what happened here? And she's like, oh, well, this and this and this. I'm like, oh, OK. And that's it.
It's like it's it's I don't I don't automatically assume any kind of mishandling or anything like that. And and it's it's been it's been great. It's been really great. So what was your question? That's it. Yeah. Exactly what you said.
What's been going on? What's happening?
Yeah, that adjustment, that adjustment into a whole different world where you don't even know what you don't know has got to be exhausting and sometimes overwhelming, but also being able to have that foundational support system with the people that do know what they're doing.
They're competent. You already said that. But also they've been doing it for long enough that you can then trust to be like, hey, what is this or like, how do I how what what is this normal? I don't know. Yeah. The not knowing what you don't know is definitely surprising.
But then like it's also a little bit embarrassing of like I'm kind of your boss. OK, I am like legit your boss. Yeah. But I don't know what this means.
You know what I mean? And I have to like ask and be like, just like we just talked about earlier, like asking about what you don't know and asking for help. Like I could have just had the ego and just been like, oh, yeah, OK. The I don't I don't even know. Like some. Yeah. Some bar term.
This piece of this piece of S. Yeah. Yeah. Instead of. Yeah. Yeah. What is this? So it's like, oh, oh, auto like, oh, the autograt. Like, oh, no. But I knew what autograt was. But anyway, still like there's little like words for everything.
And I'd have to ask sometimes, you know, like, what is this? And I think that that is it's hard to admit that you don't know something when you're supposed to be in the management role of, you know, all the things.
And it being the first year, I'm just very thankful that we have someone in charge of stuff that like she didn't hold that over anybody. She didn't make anyone feel bad for asking. And by anyone, I mean me. So it's like it was it was always a very like supportive, helpful transition into this role.
And and yeah. So, again, what was your question? Yeah. I didn't really have a question. So you did great. But yeah. So like that that having the people involved that really know what they're doing and trust you that you're coming in with that positive intent.
That's I think the fact the positive intent thing, assuming it assuming positive intent has to go both ways to be truly successful.
And I feel like because you were patrons of the restaurant for so long, because you came in and you're like, we want to keep this as close, like the same energy, the same vibes, everything to the original. Like you're not coming in, you know, oh, I want to make all of these changes.
I want to be the coolest, hippest, like, I don't know, modern. Let's like change all of the the lights and whatnot just to make it a different energy. I feel like that kind of set up the fact that you are here authentically. You're doing what you're saying that you want to do.
And so any any comments or questions or things that you want to change, like the nachos, you know, being able to to be like you want to make it better, but still what it was.
That allows them to kind of assume that positive intent in return and be like, yeah, TIF wants to make these changes to make it better, not just to be the owner of a restaurant type of a thing. Yeah. Yeah.
I mean, it's definitely there was a lot of trust there for I think everyone, not only the staff, but also the community to know that we are actually there to preserve this place that so many of us, you know, really love. And that intention is genuine. And it's also real.
Like, we're not just coming in and saying that's what we want to do and then doing something completely different. Like this past year, kind of we wanted to spend the time to prove to everyone that like, no, we really do want to keep it the way it is.
But also like, you know, digging through the office and having access to like everything now because like, man, the restaurant's like 40 years old and it was another place, another restaurant before that. So we're finding like all the old menus and things. Oh, wow.
And it's like the place has changed throughout the years. You know what I mean? So it's like we're not like if we stayed the same, it would have gotten stagnant. So every there has been changed.
So that also made us not afraid to like add new things, because if you stay too much the same, then you get left behind. Right. So and it was a good thing to see that a beloved place that's been around for 40 years has adjusted itself slowly at the right pace, I believe. Yeah.
Because you never really notice the changes. Like we keep around certain little things like these green place mats and like the doilies under the soup dishes. Right. Like these little nods to like the charm. Yeah. I love a good doily. Like this.
Everyone hates the doilies because they all stick together. You have to sit and pull them all apart and all this stuff. But like we do it because like little things like that still like say that this is the same place. But like, yeah, we're going to update our food.
I don't think that there was a tuna poke bowl on the menu, you know, 20 years ago. Right. But there is now. Not from us. It was there years ago, but like from our chef. Right.
But still, like it's it's nice to to feel that we can inject our own personality into it here and there at like a good level. With respect. Without like, you know, really ruining this beloved place. And speaking of beloved, too, we thought we were the ones that were there a lot. Oh, my goodness.
There are so many other regulars that are there like every day, like every day. Like now that I get to like see I could see people's checks and like read all the stuff. Like you have access to all the stuff. Oh, my God. It's like looking through people's trash. Oh, it's like, oh, my God.
These and it's sometimes it's just like a group of strangers at the bar that come in. You're like, oh, my gosh, this group of bachelors is having a night. Oh, my God. Round after round after round. OK, let's throw in some baked clams. Oh, we're going again. You can see this whole night.
But like but like it's it is it is just great to see all of that and and know that we aren't the only ones that love this place as like there are people that are like literally eating there every single day, which we love.
And those are the people that are really going to notice if something is off. And we heard nothing but great things all year. So that was wonderful. That was the best gift, really, of this whole thing is that like everyone was super happy. So, oh, I love that. I bet that just feels so good.
You're like, OK, all of this work, all of this energy, all of this time paid off in a way that you're you're really like loving. I'm sure. Yeah, there is a wild feeling of being in a tangible place around actual people. So I know this sounds crazy, but like go with me here.
Like that are you don't know, like you don't know almost all of them, but like sitting in a place that you own and you hear conversations and you hear people around you like being happy and present and not on their phones and not like through the Internet. I don't know.
Like I feel like so much of my life has been on the Internet for so long. Like since I left my costume job in the city, I have been like online. Like that's been where I've worked. This is where I've had my colleagues like you live across the country like we're on a video.
Like we have a connection, but it's like all of a sudden being in a real place where like I know this sounds like a wild, I don't know, millennial like, oh, my gosh, I touch grass. Right. Like kind of situation.
But to have a business after being virtual for so long, that is a real brick and mortar place with people out in the world and and you're watching people have fun and enjoy themselves in something that you contributed to keeping feels amazing. Like it's it's it's it's incredible.
Like you're just like this is community like this is what community feels like in a way that I haven't felt in a really, really long time. Yeah. Oh, my goodness.
And so even though you now own this and restaurant and you're there so much more than you were before, are you able to still kind of find joy in that? Like not feeling like are you able to relax in in your restaurant or do you have a different place that you go to relax now?
So this actually came up in the summer and I think it's really interesting where when we get very busy, sometimes there's like an hour wait for tables.
We don't take a reservation, but like we I get this like anxiety feeling of I don't want to take up a table at the restaurant when we could be like making money. Yeah.
You know what I mean? Because like we eat we go on like our our tab goes on to a family tab because essentially we bought all the food. So we don't need to pay for it. It's like we paid for it. We're paying the staff to cook it and serve it. And, you know, of course, we we tip our servers. Right.
Of course. But like I just want to put that out there for anyone who who has experienced like bad owners that like don't tip when you serve them. It's messed up. But like it's like, you know, we kind of eat for quote unquote free, I guess. Yeah.
But but at the same time, it's like, well, we're then not making any money off of our what we made. We're buying everything at cost, essentially. And so I get this anxiety of we shouldn't take up a table like when we're really busy and when we're really busy. Yeah, we do not like we don't.
We go eat somewhere else. You know, we go to a friend's restaurant who they opened up a new place like right across the green. Oh, amazing. So we just like walk on over there and, you know, if they're swamped, we go somewhere else or we get take out from our place.
But like, you know, there are options or we cook at home like never.
But so but what Marco said to me, we he's like, we bought this place so we can continue to enjoy it, which kind of goes back to what I said, like in the very, you know, the genesis of this whole situation was, how would you feel if next summer this wasn't here?
And like we couldn't go to our favorite place.
And it's like he's like, I don't want to feel like I can't eat in my favorite place. Like that's the reason we bought it. And I was like, oh, wow. Like that then all of a sudden relieved me of that guilt. Not all of it. I still have it.
But like it relieved me of that guilt of I'm taking up a table from the profit of the restaurant because it's like this is also we did this for ourselves to enjoy and keep this, you know, gem that we love in our lives. Like why would we then make our experience worse? Right.
So for that, that's kind of like my new portion of a profit, like that one table that you're taking up is not going to make or break the restaurant. Right. If it was, that'd be a whole other different conversation.
If we're like, we're not going to, you know, again, if we're slammed, we're not going to like mess up the entire host system and be like, put, see, give us a seat. Like, no, no, we're not like that.
We'll just be like, hey, how's it looking? And, you know, our host will be like, no, we're like, gotcha. No problem. There's like a chef's table out in the kitchen also that like if we really wanted to, we could sit back there.
But again, it's like, I don't really want to go sit next to the garbage. Nice aroma. It's like, I really like our food, but not that much. Yeah. So actually, it would be worth it. I'd still sit by the garbage. But in the right mood.
But yeah, but no, it's, yeah, it's, you know, so, so that was like a real great moment. I think that we came to, it took us a few months, you know, to get to that spot. But I think overall, that's a really healthy way to look at it.
And it will overall keep our enjoyment of the place alive because it's like, not only are we working there and, you know, like the lights break. I need to go in in the morning and fix the lights and, you know, manage things that go wrong or whatever we need to do.
So those keep, I don't know, like, maybe because it's fresh and new, I don't have a headache from any of that yet. It's still just, just kind of like, it feels so much like a family there also. That like, it feels like we're all working to keep this place alive for all of us. Yeah.
And that is, is very rewarding. And again, like just right back to the connection with the community. Yeah, that's incredible. I am so happy for you.
Do you have a list of kind of what you're hoping to do in this off season to get it, like, to do better, to do even better? Well, I still have to do a whole bunch of QuickBooks entries from our last few weeks. I've been putting that off.
I've been giving myself a nice little grace period after we closed. So I need to go and process all those bills that came in. But there's no new ones coming in. So it's not like I need to, like, keep up. Yeah.
But, but yeah, we definitely have a few, like, improvement projects, you know, certain things about the building that we need to fix while no one is there.
Which is a huge blessing that, like, we kind of are seasonal and there is a chance to get ahead of that kind of stuff without having to close the restaurant, without having to disrupt service of any kind. You know, the place is empty. We close it down. Everything shut off. The food is gone.
You know, yeah. We it's funny. Everyone kind of like as restaurants on the island close, everyone kind of like passes on. They're like, they're like, oh, we have extra this. Do you guys? Yeah, we want. OK. So then they take it. Amazing. So it doesn't go to waste. It's it's it's really great. Yeah.
Nothing goes to waste. So, you know, at the end of the season, we order less and then we just sell it till we sell out. And but yeah, so postseason. Well, yeah, postseason, offseason. We are I mean, it's it's a lot of organization at this point. Capital improvements, that kind of stuff.
There's a few little admin things that we might want to do. But again, it's all pretty minor trying to figure out, like, what does it mean to take gift cards? Like, that's a whole accounting thing that like I have to learn about.
It's like, you know, it's then it's this whole complicated thing or it's a liability against the business liability, not in a bad way, but just in like a you owe this money out because like it was already bought.
And so you're going to get cashed in on it maybe when you aren't ready to as opposed to like something that's immediate. It's like owing on a credit card kind of liability.
But yeah, so there's all these like little kind of accounting business things that it's more of like, OK, let's get a handle on what this looks like all year. And then I've been making spreadsheets. I really like making spreadsheets.
So I've been making some very lovely spreadsheets of like, here are our costs and here's how much we spent on labor and here's how much we spent on food and liquor and and non-alcoholic things.
And this is what we brought in like, oh, it looks like we're much more of a restaurant than a bar this year.
You know, like that kind of like, OK, so if we're going to change the buns, how much is this going to cost? And, you know, what does this sandwich cost like next year's menu prices? How are they going to get adjusted?
And, you know, little things like that where it's like how much waste was there this year? You know, like how much did we spend versus what we take in? What can we shave off? Is it worth shaving off?
You know, like we don't want to make the experience so bad that like we're cost cutting so close that, you know, we're eking out just this tiny bit like we had last year.
Yesterday at the management meeting, we had like a whole 15 minute talk about napkins, right? Like napkins, like how much this box of napkins cost seventy five dollars for three thousand. But this box of napkins cost twenty five dollars for three thousand.
It's like, OK, but then these napkins are thicker. So we're using less of those. But like if we are the thinner ones, then we're using more of those.
So which ones are like we just like the amount of time we just spent talking about napkins and each napkin costs, you know, like point oh eight percent or eight cents like, you know. And so it's like that's the kind of stuff that we're talking about now.
But it matters because like it's funny that it like came up. Our manager Julie was like at another place talking with she like she just knows everyone like she is. She knows everyone in the community. She's worked with them for like all 20 years. Everyone is so close.
Like I said, all the different bars are like the staffs are all close. They all are like a thousand bridesmaids in each other's weddings and that kind of stuff.
It's it's it's this amazing, amazing community of like the people that work there in the summers, which is another thing that I should talk about. The imposter syndrome of like kind of buying your way into that world, which feels really bad. It feels really bad.
But before but yeah, so to close out the napkin talk, you know, she was discussing napkins with someone else at their bar because she noticed you have the good napkins. Oh, we didn't we decided not to get the napkins. We're talking about napkins. People have thoughts on napkins.
So yeah, so maybe our postseason will will be about napkins like, you know, but it's like all that little stuff. And then preparing for next year because we open for St. Paddy's as like a little weekend thing.
Last year, I cooked with the previous owner, the corned beef and cabbage that they put out for free for everybody is like a thank you to the community. And then the bar is open.
And so, you know, prepping and thinking about next year already, like, you know, making sure that we're going to be ready for that.
Is the previous owner going to cook with me again? Or am I flying solo? Like, you know, how many loaves of Irish soda bread am I going to be baking? Like, you know, because we don't have our kitchen staff back at that point.
It's just kind of like a thing that, you know, the restaurant has always done. And we are like, if that's what this place has always done, it's like a tradition. Everyone expects it. Damn right. We're doing it. Yeah. This is happening.
I'm getting Jimbo's recipe and we are making corned beef and cabbage. Yeah. So, yeah. So, you know, we that's kind of going to be the postseason. We do get a lot of chance to relax. I mean, like a lot of the staffs around the island, they either get, you know, offseason jobs here and there.
But a lot of them like travel all winter or they go down to Jamaica or they live in Puerto Rico or like, you know, there's like all these different things that people do in the winter and then they come back in the summer. So we kind of have that little reprieve.
Also, it's not going to be like, oh, yeah, we're going to be swamped until the place opens again. It's like, well, we can actually take it easy, which is kind of a big bonus to buying this place in particular. Yeah, absolutely. Especially because it already has that cadence in play.
So you don't have to try and make changes to that. And then you mentioned in our pre-talks about like your creativity and how that kind of took that back burner approach.
But now that you are closed and being able to expand on your creativity, because anyone that doesn't know you, like Tiff has incredible creative outlets that she has done in the past. I have so much of your stained glass, like right over here, which I love.
I see the black and white rainbow right in the back end. Like so much is and then painting or pottery or like all of the things that you've done in the past.
Are you excited to be able to kind of re-engage that? And then are you dreading the season coming again to like lose that or kind of how is how is that mental balance kind of working with that?
I've been I've been very preoccupied with learning all of the restaurant stuff that I've had to learn and making that kind of my focus for the year.
So because of the way my brain works, where I always look for those new dopamine hits everywhere. And it's like I don't have hobbies. My hobby is hobbies. So it's like I have all of these outlets that before I would engage with and fixate on because I had the time to do that.
Now, I don't have the time to do that. But I'm also equally engaged and faded on the newness of this work, which, you know, to say like once it becomes more rote, once I kind of get more in the groove and it's a little bit easier to like handle because I'll know the things that I had to learn.
And I think I will start opening up and having more time to do creative things. But like it really has been odd because whenever I do get those creative twinges, I have to put them aside because it's like I don't really have time for this. Or I would start something and I could never finish it.
So like something like stained glass where it's like I need hours and days in the studio to like work on and finish a piece if I have an idea for something or even if someone were to order anything for me, which I've like closed down orders on.
It's like I just I don't have the capacity to engage with that, which it's frustrating because like I will get the drive to do it. But then sometimes I'm just like I'm also just kind of tired, you know, which I'm not like too tired to like I'll still find something to do.
It's like not it's the sticky hands. So like that's why right now with like doing the like Halloween stuff, it's like I see like I get a again, it's new. It's a dopamine hit. It's a temporary thing.
It's not like investing in like a long term, bigger creative project, which takes its own kind of special energy. Yeah. But I definitely think that like I will find a time where I'm going to be like I need to get more creative, creative slots in my day.
You know, I'm going to need to carve out a little bit more time, more intentional time for some of that instead of just like the whim of I'm making a crocheted ghost today. Like a crazy magpie person that like it's like, oh, friendship bracelets, crocheted ghost. Oh, great stuff.
Weird tree with lanterns. Yes. Weird, crazy gremlin making all over the house is what's been happening. It's quite unstoppable. But, you know, I'll draw some weird little card and send it to somebody. You know, like there's there's all these little things that will drive me.
But when it comes to like a bigger creative project where I was like, especially during the make do times where I was trying to have like more of an art career. I think that that has drastically shifted over to kind of restaurant management, which honestly, like it's so it's so weird that it feels.
I know it shouldn't matter. And but like it feels really good to be able to say I have more of a tangible job now as opposed to the like when you talk to adults because I'm not an adult yet. You're not an adult yet.
Like, you know, the grownups out there that like judge us and stuff and don't understand like what podcasts are. Those people, when they ask you, you know, what do you do? And you're like, I am a stained glass artist.
And they're like, well, you make any money with that? It's like, you know, like it's like you're like, oh, I mean, not really. But like I can finally say like I own a restaurant out on Fire Island and they're like, oh, you know, like this is a real job. This is a real job. Real job.
Everything's a real job. Like I very much believe everything is a real job. But like this feels really good for the first time in maybe like, gosh, 20 years, maybe a little less. How old's my child? 13 years. So that I've had like the quote unquote real job. So that feels really good to have that.
I don't know. Gosh, it's like I was going to say like pedigree. No, that's not the word. Like the title or like the. Gosh, what what is that word? I know. Yeah, I don't know what it was. It just it feels like there's substance there.
No, no, it's still like that just makes it sound like the other things don't have substance. Which they do. But like it's I don't know. It just it feels more legitimate. A societal affirmation of what you're doing is real. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
And as much as like, you know, I want to be the, you know, liberal who kind of defies all that and like, you know, kick society in the face and all that. And I'm also like, aren't you proud of me, society? I have a thing that I do now. And I'm like real and I'm an owner of something, you know.
So it's like, you know, it's or I could even be like, you know, oh, I'm in charge of the finances at a restaurant. You know, like even if I wanted to do that, because as, you know, certain demographics of our society, we tend to downgrade the things that we do in life. Right.
Whereas other people inflate them without thinking. Yeah. Yeah. We all know what I'm talking about. But anyway, like, yeah. So there's there's that aspect of it, too, where, you know, it's kind of changed my again. I don't want to say self-worth.
There's like this weird nuance that's going on here that all of a sudden made me feel like a grown up. In a in a kind of good way. I don't know. Yeah. Brains are weird how they'll they'll think of things.
It's it's funny because so this new client I'm working with and the job that I'm doing, they have like an actual location, obviously, because they're manufacturing parts and make. And I have visited the place a couple of times and I'm like, there's an actual place.
And I just realized, like, this is the first time in a very long time, with the exception of the bar that I was helping, like, do their social media marketing stuff for. This is the first time that it's been an actual place, like a physical location.
And so I kind of understand the the reality of it, of like, I can touch a building and it's real. Like, it's not this ethereal, ephemeral, like. Existing of like, yes, this is a real job. This is legitimate things that I do. So but it's hard to describe, like. You don't know. Yeah.
And so like random, you know, Joe Blow, 80 year old neighbor. Oh, what do you do? And you're like, I own a bar, like versus. And they're like, I understand. Also, you are a lady. What are you doing? I'm not a bar. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, my goodness. Frays are weird. Oh, incredible. Incredible.
Well, I hope this next season you're able to kind of find some creativity in that. Like you're able to do during during the year. If you get those urges or finding something that you can like. I want to blah, blah, blah. I want to do something creative.
And you can sit down and do like, you know, friendship bracelets for an hour or whatever to just kind of like. That's my that's my don't be on your phone while on the boat activity, which is good.
Oh, actually, a tiny little creative thing that I did end up letting myself do during the whole restaurant thing.
It's like, I definitely should not be spending my time doing this, but I'm going to anyway, which was like making a kid's menu, which was normally we just order a kid's menu from like wherever. But I'm like, no. I'm like, I'm sorry. My name is Tiff Arment and I cannot do that. Yeah.
I need like that needs to be mine. Like I need to have like weird little things on the menu. And so like, you know, I made a little kid's play placemat kind of activity sheet. And that was like my little creative input for the restaurant. You know, like I felt like, oh, OK, I can I can do this.
This will be fun. I definitely should spend my time. But how many drawings you've done for lunches over the years, like being able to do this for multiple kids now? Like you have this little like creation. Exactly. So like next year, I want to make a new menu.
And then we have another member of our staff, one of our bartenders and servers. She is also insanely creative. She actually drew our shirts and sweatshirts and stuff for this year. So like we put her drawing on the menu, which ended up being like a drawing of the bar.
So the kids are like coloring little bottles of alcohol, which I thought was awesome. I think that's great. I'm like, this is a little inappropriate, but I kind of love it for us. The kids are in a place that serves alcohol. It's fine. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. It's a bar restaurant.
They've seen these before. It's juice, Billy. It's juice. Okay. But yeah, so that was like a tiny little creative endeavor that like I could have talked myself out of doing and being like, no, don't waste your time right now. There's so much more to think about.
But instead, I took the time to do it. And when we print them out and I hand them out to the kids and they get all excited, like that is just so worth it. Like it's just I'm yeah, this feels good. That was a dumb project. But damn, am I glad I did it. Yay.
Dumb projects can be helpful and good and supportive. And like it doesn't matter because it had a purpose. It had a purpose. Yeah. So I hope you I hope you can find some more joyful things like that in the future. I'm sure I will. I'm awesome. No, obviously.
That's why you're here because you are awesome. That's been a little bit of my new thing to like joke about how awesome I am until I believe it. Yeah. So there you go. Right. Like that's a great that's a great trip.
It is a trick because then you start saying it as a joke and then you're like, hold on. It's like, you know, the new slang words and people start saying it ironically and then it becomes unironic because you're saying it all the time and believing it. Yeah. It's that. It's that.
Let's trick our brains. I love it. Yep. I love it. Do it. Amazing. Brain tricks. All right. Well, is there anything else you wanted to talk about before we move on? I think I blabbed a lot. Yeah. And it's great. We loved it. Some good blabbing. Yes. Perfect. Key token blabbing. We love it.
What are you going to work on in the next two weeks? Oh, well, I am still working on Halloween-y stuff. Um, I did my costume already.
That was another one of the things that I was very busy with was doing my Halloween costume, which I already wore because there is special adult trick-or-treating out at the beach where you do a shot crawl at everyone's house instead. It rules so much. That's amazing. Everyone dresses up.
They have bowls of candy for the kids to make it look like it's trick-or-treating. Right, right, right. But it's all shots. Like every house has like all kinds of different crazy shots that they have. So I always get dressed up for that every year.
So getting my costume ready for that was part of my old two-week thing. So I guess my whole house decoration thing is kind of more of a this two-week thing. Yeah, this Fortnite. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's kind of all Halloween right now. I love it. The Halloween bubble. Yes.
What about Adam's costume? What is his costume? Adam is now, he, his costume is from a video game. I should know this. He's been 3D printing it for the most part. So he's doing it himself, basically? He is kind of doing it himself.
He asked me to help him like put the straps on and like get him like an orange jumpsuit from Amazon, like that kind of stuff. Yeah. So he's more independent with his costume. I believe it's a from Lethal Company.
It's like an orange jumpsuit and it looks like a gas mask like that he printed and like these tanks. Oh, amazing. So embarrassing. I should know what this game is. I don't play. I don't play it. So like I can't. You can't identify it. I think it's Lethal Company. I think it's Lethal Company. Yeah.
You know what? Listen, we're going to say that it's Lethal Company because nobody's going to know any different. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I was going to look it up and I was going to be like, oh, anyway, but yeah, so he's been busy doing that. So we've been playing with a 3D printer a lot. Thing.
But yeah, so I don't have that as much to occupy me as before either. Yeah. But you got to do your own. So there you go. I did, which was mostly shopped. Would you like to know what I was? I would absolutely love to know what you were.
I'm going to post pictures of it closer to Halloween because I think it's like weird to post a picture of your costume like three weeks before Halloween. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But I was Weird Al Yankovic. Oh, my God. I can't wait to see. Yeah. I'm so excited. It was ridiculous. That's incredible.
I had such a good time being Weird Al and acting like Weird Al. Oh, my gosh. I'm going to scroll up real fast and then I'm going to show you this picture of myself. Yes. You are flawless. Oh, my God. That's so good. I know. I think I just really like wearing a mustache. Yeah.
Listen, you got to embrace it. Own it. Own it. I feel like all my costumes are just going to be like mustached men. We can do Ted Lasso. I'll just go through all of those. Oh, my God. Yes. Yeah. Oh, my gosh. There's so much. Yep. Incredible. Yeah. Tom Selleck. Yes.
I'm coming for you next year, Tom. Absolutely. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Yes. Incredible. I can't wait. Can't wait for everyone else to see. You heard it here first, though, friends. That's right. Yeah.
My fortnight, I am going to, I need to figure out my like morning routine with this secondary job because it's so separate from my normal stuff. I have been feeling very like, not confused is the wrong word, but like I feel like I'm like in these two buckets of like, this is my normal unicorning.
And then I come over here and I do this other stuff. And I need to figure out how to kind of intermingle that in the morning of like, okay, these are the hours that I'm going to work on this more complex type projects, which is rare. And it's not something I've had to do with my work before.
So I need to figure out kind of my morning prep stuff in these next two weeks. Now that I have a better idea of what the hell I'm doing, which is super fun. Yeah.
With having like those two different job types, do you find yourself like accidentally intermingling everything? And like one of those like, what's it, that Malcolm in the Middle where it's like, oh, I'm going to fix the drawer. And then, oh, it's squeaky. So let me go get some WD-40.
And then like, oh, the garage is messy. Let me clean the garage. Like I can imagine that happening with like the crossfade between two different jobs. It's like one activity will accidentally lead you into an activity of the other job. And so like nothing actually gets really finished.
I mean, I feel like that's what happened to me. I almost had more of that previously when I was, you know, I'm in the same thing. I'm working on, you know, sending invoices for so-and-so. Okay. Well, now I need to go over and send invoices for somebody else. Oh, I forgot. I didn't send the money.
Like my brain will kind of like spiral for that. But because this work is so different from anything I've ever done before, it's – there's not a whole lot of things touching. Like it's so very different. And then also having the second location basically.
The problem is that switching – because I tend to do a lot of context switching in my day and like working on different projects.
And so the fact that I'm not doing that anymore for this like particular thing where I have to stop what I'm doing for my stuff and kind of go over there, it means that I have to be more purposeful with when I'm doing everything. So like I don't know if it's time blocking.
I don't know if it's like, okay, Tuesdays and Thursdays I'm working from one to four on this stuff or I don't know what that looks like yet. But I have to put some thought into it to kind of be more – so I need to figure that out. Perfect. All right. Well, let's get to our conductors.
Our checklist enthusiast of the show, Mike, says, new connection, clean up my office. My office is overdue for a good dusting and cleanup. Clean up. Listen, having dusting at all on the list, like that's two thumbs up there. You are winning. Well done. Good luck, Mike.

Yeah, you just, I, okay, I know this isn't a point for suggestions. Find an early event in October to go to with a costume and that definitely forces you to get your costume sorted earlier. That's brilliant. Because I am the same. You just so, so, so procrastinate.
And now, now you don't because you gotta get it ready. No, no, because I have, I have, well, I'd still procrastinate for that, but it's at least early. Yeah, but it's not as bad. Yeah. And it's also like a test run. If you have somewhere else to go with the costume, you can adjust things. Yeah.
Smart. Get you thinking. That's right. Our robotics engineer of the show, Aiden, says, Next connection. Try to actually make that table. My fiance is on a work trip next week, so I should have a little more time to spend in the garage. Let one pair of shoes. Shark of the show, Chris.

Start working on next year's curriculum for the youth group. I can't believe how quickly time flies. I know. I looked up and it's almost November. I thoroughly enjoyed having a curriculum this year and it allowed me to develop more material with less effort on the daily side.
It also gave me time to develop my team and mentor them, not just telling them what to do. With this new job, I realized... Oh my gosh, it goes to the next place. Okay, here we go. You're doing great. You're doing great. You're doing so good. I know I gave you the hard one. Okay.
With this new job, I realized I'll definitely need the framework. My goal is to have at least one month of the curriculum completed before the start of the new year, ideally in Q1. Also, I'll continue to explore additional education resources for the Jobby Job Project.
I still feel a bit out of my depth there, but I know I can manage it. Good luck, Nameless. And good job, Tiff. You had a long... It broke... There's a line. Two pages. Yeah, like a page break. That definitely messed you up. You did great. You did great. Okay. Okay.
