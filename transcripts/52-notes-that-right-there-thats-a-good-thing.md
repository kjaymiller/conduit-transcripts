From really FM, you're listening to Conduit, the show where we can do our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that makes notes about how awesome you are. This episode is brought to you by Memberful. I'm Kathy and I am here with my fabulous co-host, Jay.
Hello Jay. Everyone is awesome. Everyone is cool when they're part of our team. Oh, that sounds kind of like, oh, team versus team. That's not good. Everybody's awesome. We'll just leave it at that. Everybody's awesome except for those people who aren't and we just punched them.
Probably shouldn't say that either. I don't know anymore. Everybody's awesome except for those other people.
In the past fortnight, in the discord, there was this beautiful chaotic moment of joy where one of our modemans, Zach had a dream about Tim Cook being interviewed by Mike and Jason on upgrade. And the tidbit that came out was the fact that he is obsessed with roast beef sandwiches.
And basically from there, of course, the discord went off and it culminated in our training of the show, Railsy, making a fake article on the Macroomer site about this culinary indulgence. And it was hilarious and entertaining and absolutely just incredible.
So wait, does this actually exist or is this like a... Oh no, it was a fake article. Like good. But is it a fake article that actually exists or is it... I mean, it exists in a screenshot.
So what you're saying is if people wanted to see this, they couldn't go to Macroomers but they could join the relay FM switch on discord. Absolutely. And the best way to do that is by visiting iamassubrconductor.com. Become a member.
Oh, speaking of members, hey, Jay, what happened in the co-working session? So...
What is the co-working session?
 The co-working session is where you and I, or in sometimes just you, or in sometimes just I, like last week, it was just I, along with our super wonderful conductor friends, our super wonderful, super conductor super friends, join for an hour of co-working where we do our best to be hyper focused on the tasks at, and I'm just kidding.
 We, um, sometimes we get work done, sometimes we just talk, and sometimes we do like we did this past week where we heavily debated whether or not the reddit CEO would be asked to step down after his shenanigans, eventually, or what social media nightmare scenario are we best okay with in a world that is both federated, non-federated, and multi-first, I guess?
I'm sorry.
I haven't seen the Spider-Man movie yet, and I really want to go see it. Oh, it's so good. Is it? Okay, um, that's all I'm going to say. Okay, I'm going to, I'm going to have to take time to check that out. Yes, yes, you definitely need to get out. Yep. Yep, yep, yep.
Anyways, um, if that sounds good, or you would like to join our co-working time and have any of those lovely conversations, but also sometimes actually get some work done. Once again, visit imasuperconductor.com and become a member and support J and I.
Do you have a shout out J? I actually have two shout outs. Is that okay? Absolutely. Okay, so the first shout out is to the super amazing folks that joined me, um, in our Juneteenth panel that we did. It was absolutely amazing.
It was a panel that I put together independently with some super amazing people, including the CEO of Black Tech Pipeline, um, and so many other people on the intersection of taking technology and all that it comes with back to Black families, Black community, and Black culture.
And it was great in that the people who watched were absolutely thrilled. The people who were on the panel were absolutely thrilled.
And one of my favorite comments that we got was finally an actual event where we talk about helping the Black community and not just what it's like to be the only Black person in the room. Um, this was an absolutely amazing event.
We want to do more of these, um, again, it's on my personal YouTube channel. If you want to check that out, um, I will put a link in the show notes. And then the second one is a shout out to some friends of mine.
One of them goes by the name of Jesse SEMA, who is the author of the not quite normal series, um, which normals the real world unicorn. The books are absolutely amazing. They're children's books that help teach, um, self identity and positivity.
Um, and just even it's okay, even if you don't fit in. And to the point where Florida has decided that it should be banned. Um, because of course, thanks, Florida. Um, but the animated series of not quite in our wall is out on Netflix.
And I understand people don't necessarily want to go support the big corporations. But what I can tell you is the author of not quite in our wall. It's absolutely amazing. They are so wonderful. They've sent my child books, even before when we had just met them.
Um, we got amazing autographed books, uh, from them. And I've read the books to my daughter for years now. And it was super excited to see that, um, not only are they in bookstores everywhere. If you go to any major bookstore or a course online, um, you'll find copies of, of all of their books.
But also now there is an entire TV show dedicated to this amazing, um, project that they've created. And I'm really excited about that. So again, it's on Netflix. Um, it is an animated show. It's for kids. So if you have kids, uh, it's great to watch with.
Or if you just want a little bit of encouragement, not quite feeling like you fit in, then I would also suggest, you know, just checking it out. Cause I liked it personally. Amazing. Thing. Um, so I have some feedback, uh, sent in by our lovely connectors.
Uh, first off, Logan, uh, says, I listened yesterday, but we've been without power in internet for 24 hours. But yes, Jay, I love it. Every time you say shout, have a new creative take on Logan, it brings me so much joy and the biggest smile.
So much that I'm starting to use it as my display name in more places. So that sounds like, uh, carte blanche, uh, permission to continue to squeal the name, shall we say? You, you mean let me see you get Logan? Yeah. Amazing.
Uh, and then fishy, Kai, our fish bear of the show has a very important question for you. And, uh, just asking, he says, uh, why is someone who doesn't like Disney consistently have Disney references? Because I have a child. I'm not. Okay.
I'm not oblivious to the fact that they're a big mainstream thing. And if you do notice that they're always for the animated things, like I can't tell you anything about any of the latest Star Wars. I have not seen any of the Marvel series other than like the first Iron Man.
Um, and I think there was one Spider-Man that I saw. Um, I don't know much about any of the classical stuff other than the stuff that everybody just knows from Osmosis. Like, I've watched Snow White. I can't tell you. All I know is that at some point in time, she gets seven roommates.
I can't tell you where in the movie that happens. Cinderella. I've seen 8,000 times because my daughter just loves Cinderella. Same with Frozen. I do have a couple of Disney movies that I think are absolutely adorable and my daughter loves them. So, um, they are okay. Shoutouts to Moana.
Shoutouts to, uh, Turning Red, which was a good one. Um, yeah, it's about it. Emperage New Groove was a banger. It feels so much not like a Disney movie that I'm okay with it. Um, and also it didn't appropriate anybody's culture directly by just taking their often gruesome childhood story.
And then, um, I'm not going to what's what's the word? Um, ripping it off and rebranding it as this American thing without giving homage to the actual, um, origins of it. Um, and also big, big, big shocker. Um, capitalism and capitalizing on people's culture for the sake of capitalism. Big gross.
Um, so yes, life is hard and also things life is complicated and there can be a world in which someone who loves trivia and loves knowledge for the sake of knowledge can know a lot about a thing that they personally do not appreciate or enjoy. Valid. That's acceptable. Anyways, moving on.
It's time for a connection checks. Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh. Zap. All right, Jay. How'd you do? Um, so I'm going to give myself a green check mark. Uh, my connection was to take two hours a day putting the things away. What I want to make, uh, hmm, let's see. how to outward this.
I didn't do the letter of the connection, but what I did was probably better.
Once we got the house cleaned up and ready to be presented, I worked extremely hard and consciously hard to make sure that everything was clean and that as I did things, I tidied after myself immediately, which made it so that I didn't need two hours to put things away. Oh, that's amazing.
Yeah, the second we move out of this house, I'll probably never do that again. That's okay because you're doing it now when you really, really need it and that's the important part. Exactly.
What about you, Kathy? I have a big green checkmark and I sent video proof to Panda of the show James of taking my bags to Goodwill. I've also posted it in the discord as confirmation and I'm very proud of myself.
Since then, I have also made another trip to Goodwill with a bunch of stuff and I'm hoping this weekend when I just have podcasts and I'm not traveling anywhere. I'm hoping, well, that's never mind. I'm not going to say it because that's a future connection.
Hey, Jay, how did our conductors do? Our train enthusiasts of the show, Ralezy, says connection check greenheart in a rare turn of events. This train enthusiast has put in his connection not on the day of the show. Schedule done, packing list, basically done.
Just got to put the things in the bags and any last minute changes. I love hearing about this, Ralezy because I just got off the phone with someone about moving all my stuff and I understand that yes, there's going to be scheduling and packing and putting things in bags. So I am already there.
I'm there with you. All right, our civil engineer of the show, Dan says connection check. I have been away for a few months. I missed you guys. We missed you too, Dan. I had to go offline as I had my civil engineering charter ship review and I found out last week I passed her.
Ralezy! I can put letters after my name and everything now. So I guess that is a big life connection tick. Abs of frickin' Lutley. Oh my gosh, we're so proud of you, Dan. Welcome back. Our mountain dweller of the show, the show that goes high and the show that goes low gang says Greenheart.
I said what I said out to say and started some really good conversations with people. Oh my goodness. Yes, all I have so many shout outs that I can't even shout out because good conversations have been had and I'm so glad that I'm not the only one having them.
Logang, thank you so much for having the conversations that need to be had with the people that they need to be had with. Super awesome way to go. Our identical twin of the show Aaron says Greenheart got most of the way there on the character UIScreen.
Need to put in buttons for leveling up stats, but I knew it would be an ambitious goal for two weeks, so I'm happy where I got to. So proud of you for not just doing the work that you got done, but also for giving yourself a Greenheart for what you did get done. That's amazing. Super proud of you.
Oh, are we going to be in a video game? Is that what I'm going to be? Yeah, absolutely. That's that's that's the video game. Oh my gosh. That sounds terrible, but what would it be? A lot of ADHD and distraction. Hey, our panda of the show. Our panda of the show says a yellow circle.
I survived the heat. So I might say he beat the heat and did some basic planning for my trip. Finished the video game with the green characters, Zelda. I know that's not Zelda. And actually even did some work. However, the eyes haven't been great as a result of that.
And I don't feel particularly green check mark worthy. That's okay. That's okay. Congratulations on defeating Ganon once again. And give your eyes a break. I mean, is it really a spoiler? Hey, what happened to that Zelda game? Let's see, Link beats Ganon. And then other things happen.
And occasionally someone goes, hey, listen. And then it's over. Yeah, yeah. One of these days, dude, if we never get a Zelda movie where Zelda actually saves Link, I'm going to be very mad. That is my goal for some some day in the future before I die. Also, I've never played a Zelda game moving on.
Kathy. I can't with you. Blue Dragon of the show sky says connection check. Blue heart. Only one week left before my beach work vacation is over. And I haven't had the energy to work on much else. But that's okay. Yes, yes, it is because you're on a beach work vacation. And that's good.
Our nameless of the show nameless. Yes, yes, we've done it. Yes, we've redacted the name. Says green for leaf clover. Because I guess that's the only color they are. I managed to get in a groove with my morning schedule. Congratulations.
I have been successfully waking up and making myself early, making yourself breakfast, making yourself ready. We're just going to say that you've been doing all the things that prepare yourself for the day early with the smiley face. So good job. Yes, breakfast. Okay.
So glad you're in the live chat. I think nameless is made of Lego. And he asks they have to build themselves. Every work. Yeah. In a way. Yeah. Yeah. That's where they go.
And code monkey of the show Douglas says connection check red square made more vests and spent way too much time on work instead of getting my office more organized or me time because I got slammed out work on a positive note. My garden is very happy, which makes me very happy.
You know what? I think that sounds great. Once again, life happens a lot. And being able to acknowledge when it's not the time to have a connection and to just survive 100% amazing. This episode of conduit is brought to you by memberful.

So we had a comment, a conversation that was had in the discord by one of the discordians who dropped a note. I'm sorry discordians. Yes. Like like accordions? Yes. Now when they type all I'm going to hear is wow. Oh my gosh. Wow. You are on a whole different level today.
I'm going to make a note of that. All right. Good. Excellent. Anyways, there was a conversation that was had about note taking. Specifically this discordian was discussing how they never really had to take notes in the past. And now stuff is starting to slip through the cracks.
And it really made me think about the fact that a lot of previously quote unquote gifted kids tended to do well in school because they can hold things a lot in their brain. And could just pull it out when you need to and maybe they don't need to take notes.
The problem is is when they get into the quote unquote real world or they get to a point where stuff happens and you need to be able to take notes.
You don't really know what to do or what like why why are notes? Where what do you do with them? Where do they go? How do you access them in the future? And so that was kind of a topic that I dropped over to Jay as an option. And he says yes, which is why we're talking about it now.
But also wanted to discuss kind of mainly that whole idea of what what do you do with the notes after you're done with them? So Jay, do you take notes? Art is note taking something that you're like good at. You do from really at them with your listening to your note away.
The show where we are our own thing.
I was one of those gifted kids that did not take notes and was a straight-A student until I wasn't and then I was a barely passing student because I did not know how to take notes and I did not know how I best took notes or how I best made notes that I would be able to reference and go back to.
How do I take notes today? Yes, I have a shout out. I use drafts to start most of my notes. I use drafts. Where texts begin? Because that's where text begins. Yes, I use drafts for everything.
And I think you mentioned something there about like I not knowing what to do with the notes after you've taken them.
And that's something that I have personally struggled with in the past and the present in that I often drafts is where the text starts and that's where the text stays because I don't know what to do with it later.
As we were talking Kathy about this topic, I mentioned this new project management tool that I'm using which will save for our next systems check.
But the thing that made me happy about it was that it actually had a really good interface for creating notes and putting them next to the thing that I need to remember which to me is always the challenge.
If my notes are in one of these tools like Obsidian or Craft or something that's designed for notes, that's great. Except for that means when I need those notes in the thing, I now have to have two things up. I have to have the thing that I'm doing and then the notes next to it.
And what I've started doing now is investing my time and energy in tools that will allow me to put notes alongside what I'm doing instead of like, oh, I need to open up this other thing over here to view the notes and then, oh, now I need the thing that I'm working on.
I want to use more tools that say, here's the thing that I'm working on. By the way, here are the notes for them. And it's not a, it's a first-class citizen not like this, tacked on plain text, you know, piece of reference.
What sort of things do you end up using? Like, you're talking about having the notes up for a project.
What sort of project things is that for? Is that like notes for a video and you're writing a script or what kind of things?
So it can be anything I like to, I like to use the word me some plus or the phrase me some plus, which is the idea that chefs use like French, it's a French cuisine thing where they take all of their stuff that they're going to need and they put it like, they lay it out.
For me, that's how I do note-taking. It is what am I going to need? What are all the things that I'm going to need for this? This can be a little bit of information. On my side, oh, no, sorry, that's, that's mumbo number five. Note-taking number five.
It, it's often like, okay, links so that I'm not searching for links, which we talked about that on clockwise.
I like using the arc browser for this specific moment for keeping links in a space where they're not open and I don't have to see them all the time, but I can quickly jump over and find that reference or find that information within the context of what I'm doing.
I also like to put not just the, like, I like to put the actual information there. Like, I like rich media note-taking. I do use markdown for a lot of things. I know a lot of people love markdown because it allows you to write text and write text fast.
I personally think that markdown is not great for note-taking because I want to add video. I want to add images and it's, it's just added extra things. I want to be able to just drag and drop a thing in and it be there and now I can see it and interact with it.
So the kind of notes that I'm taking, if, if I'm doing a video, it's going to be yes, it'll be a script, but it'll also be links to the things that I'm referencing in the script. It'll be a timeline of what I'm hoping to get done.
It'll be a link to where I have to go and report the stuff to my stakeholders.
 It'll be anything and everything that I can think of that's going to make sure that it's all in one place so I'm not having to hunt for it, which is why I'm really excited for the new tool that I'm using because now I don't have to go to my calendar and look when we do conduit anymore, I can just say, oh, let me go to the conduit page and it has all of the conduit URLs that we might need.
It'll have all the information who, oh, here's the link to where we keep our audio files and here's the template that we used to record with and here's the link to the show notes template that we have and also here's a link to the zoom calls that we use and all that stuff.
So I'm really keeping everything and I'm taking notes for anything that I might need to go back and recall. That's really interesting. So I tend to have my notes in different locations and it depends on what the notes are being used for.
I tend to use the notes for particular clients or events or whatever.
So if I am meeting with a client, I have my iPad mini open and I'm taking notes with the Apple pencil in Notability because this allows me to access it from all of my devices, but the physical act of hand writing the notes is what clicks it into my brain.
And so I can remember where they're at in like in those specific notes for that specific client. So I can always scroll around and find something that I need to know. For podcasts, I'll have the show notes.
This is where we're pulling the stuff first for this show in particular and where I'll make notes of what links we need to add to the show. That's sort of thing.
But for me, notes are not just for like putting text to be accessed in the future, but it's kind of an ADHD coping mechanism for me to pay attention because I'm able to pull the words through this brain that doesn't like it sees the words as they're coming into my head.
And so I'm writing them down. So I know what pieces I need to remember or I need to be actively like aware of to the point where if I not taking notes, I tend to like lose track of what's being said, which was helpful in school.
I also was, you know, pretty much straight A's did really well on tests. And I think that's partially because of the notes that I took. I remember I would take I would use different colors for different classes. So I knew, hey, if it's a purple pen, it's my ethnomethodology class in college.
And then this transferred to like business. There is one. So one of my careers in the past when I worked in an office office, I would take notes from like voicemails or meetings that I had in particular colors for a particular day. So like Monday was purple. Let's say I don't remember what it was.
So when I was flipping through the notebook, I would know, oh yeah, the meeting, you know, I have a weekly meeting on Mondays. Here's where those notes are.
This was back before, you know, technology was really easy to use, but it was that that color coding really helped trick my brain to recognize what I needed to do. And I've learned how I need to take the notes to make it work for my brain.
I mean, so in college, I was actually hired to like give my notes to people. Like I would take notes on carbon copy paper. So that my notes could be handed over to kids in the class that needed it. So like I guess I'm good at note taking. But it's nice to have it, it works for me.
And I know that it's not easy for for everyone. But the the trick that I've used is like, is there something that I might need to know? Let me write it down. And I don't stress about, oh my gosh, I'm taking too many notes mainly because this is how my brain will remember the stuff.
So even if I don't go back and look at the notes, I'll remember having written them, which means that it can work. Yes, James, I will do your homework for you. So this is really interesting because I do something kind of similar.
I definitely resonate with the like I have to be doing something otherwise. I'm not paying attention. The sad thing is the more notes that I take, the more I'm likely not paying attention. I'm just going to throw that up. I actually do the opposite.
I preoccupy my brain with something that is kind of a mindless task. Like right now, I while you were talking about all of those things, I remembered that you had asked for me to show kind of what that tool that I was looking at looked like. But I do I had to desensitize some things.
So I was like, well, let me desensitize the things. And then to upload the thing. And that I mean, I don't take notes to remember. But I do take a little little little notes. And those are things that I write down. I have the psych the sidekick notepad, not the psychic notepad.
I wish I were psychic notepad. That would be great. But the sidekick notepad, because when I'm in if there's something that someone says, or there's something that I absolutely need to remember, then I write it down. And then I go back and I figure out where I need to put that information.
But it's it'll literally be like, hey, you have a vet appointment for your dog goes on Tuesday at 3pm. And I'll just go dogs that Tuesday 3pm. And like I just write that down. And it's not it that's not where it lives. But it's like I took that down that way.
If I go, what was I supposed to do? Oh, yeah, it's like right there. And I can look at it and see it. And then at that point, I'll go, oh, let me add that to my calendar.
But in the in the like as people are talking or as things were happening, I could never really take notes because if I'm trying to listen to what's being said with full intention, my brain will just be like, hey, you know, you got that thing with your dogs at 3pm or something like that.
Do you need to make sure that the leashes are clean?
And then like my brain will just get overwired, whereas if I'm like hearing someone talking, then I can focus on them talking while I'm taking the interruption center of my brain and pre-occupying it with some meaningless task that's just going to keep it keep it there.
That being said, I'm interested because you mentioned the super, super studious nature of your notes where you did things like color code and things like that. I've heard of all of these systems like the Cornell method and like people that do flashcards and things like that.
What like Kathy, what's your secret? What's the thing that what's the thing that allowed you to I mean, you've you've podcasted with me for two years now.
In that time, we've had two, three systems for doing show notes and taking information and they've all slightly devolved into we get up and we do the show and the show just happens and that's kind of the show and everything is great now.
What's your secret to consistency on things that you're going to have to keep for a medium to long period of time? That's a great question but I definitely haven't answer for. Not like I'm interviewing you.
I think I think the biggest thing is the fact that I'm not too worried about consistency is so much as doing what works and if that means I need to change something cool. For example, this the job that I had that each day I used the same color.
I tended to use spiral notebooks but at one point they I don't know ran out of spiral or whatever and I had to use a legal pad. The problem with that is that of course it's yellow paper and I could not use my orange pen on yellow paper that doesn't work.
 And so I had to change to then like use black so I could read it for until we got spiral notebooks in and it was a nightmare and it ruined me for the entire time that I was trying to take these notes to the point where I bought spiral notebooks myself to keep in my drawer to make sure that it like I had some in case you know the supply office ran out.
 But I wasn't worried about what I would need it for in the future because the the notes that I took very rarely got reviewed after that week like it was never something like oh I need to keep this for two years from now so I can come back and see when this voicemail from so and so was received like that's not so like I didn't I don't need you know the field notes artisanal box or fancy rubber bands to stack it on the corner like mr.
 Stephen Hackett has because it's not that's not what I'm taking the notes for it doesn't the consistency doesn't happen because I tell myself I need to be consistent the consistency happens because I need it in order to be to get the things done that I need to get done if that makes sense it does and and that kind of points back to a conversation we had in the pre-show which if if people want to hear about that you know become a member at letter i letter m letter a superconductor.
com where one of the the big the big things that I've been trying to do now is to do things just for the sake of doing them and then understanding that they are going to have some side effect um I think that the fact that you just take notes you know you just keep swimming you just keep doing the thing and because you keep doing the thing even if it's different there are consistencies and patterns that start to develop over time and I think this this works great with people who are trying to cook oh hey I know that whenever I cook chicken there's certain spices and there's a certain way that I like to prepare that I don't necessarily need to take notes on that I don't need to document those things because I do it enough times to just understand okay I'm going to do this the way I normally do it but maybe I'll try something a little bit different this time and then this is a problem that I have with note taking is that I don't think all notes are created equal I think that there are notes that you need to take kind of as I mentioned before that are I'm writing this down so that I can remember it later um there are notes that are I'm writing this down to help solidify like the the motion of writing it down to solidify learning I I'm from that generation that you know if I write something down I will more than likely remember it longer than if I were to type it um but also there is the I'm writing this down because I might need it in the future like I don't need to remember it but I just it it would be good to have and and that's the one that I often criticize folks on doing because I think that you know the the current technological climate that we have at the moment makes it really easy to go and find the things that you're looking for um and yes I hear people saying oh but you know it's faster for me to just check my notes for that thing than to go and look for it again and I hear you but here's the problem I forget what I've taken notes on a lot and there are so many times where you know I I've used pinboard over the years and a lot of things that I bookmarked just automatically get added to pinboard and there are times when I will go oh hey this link is super useful I'm going to add it to my pinboard only to see that it's already been added to my pinboard three years ago oh no so at at that point there's there's no reason for me to sit there and say oh I'm going to take extra time to collect this information present metadata around it and do all these other things where in the future I'm going to do a quick search on the internet and find the exact same reference to the exact same thing that I was like this is super important I need to learn it and I understand that we also live in a world where information can disappear from the internet okay yeah I'm willing to accept that that information might just disappear and be gone forever um and if it is then fine hopefully if it's something that I have sincerely like this has changed my life in a way that I need to make sure it exists for always and forever I will write a blog post about it and then at that point if it disappears it's my fault because I've chosen to disappear it um but the information the knowledge that I gleaned from that one thing will now be preserved and I understand that that that doesn't work for everyone and again this is a show where we talk about things that we know don't work for everyone hoping that people will take it and and use it but I mostly want to say all of that to just let people know that like if you're doing something and you know you feel like I have to do this but it doesn't seem like it's working question whether or not you have to do it because I think in many cases the answer is probably not yeah yeah no that's really good uh thing that's not like a great that's a good thing that's a good thing right there that's that right there that's a good thing you're done good um it's like listen here at conduit we say some of the same things over and over and one of those things that we say you're done good yeah that's good but also that everyone is different and awesome and awesome and everything like you're going to have to try things out to see what's gonna work for you and take pieces from each of those to make it work for what you want to do because there is no one perfect solution that currently exists out there you can't just read a book and magically osmosis brings it to work specifically for your brain i'm sorry i know what heartbreaking heartbreaking but that doesn't that it doesn't that's how it works yeah and uh it sucks i wish there was a way that we could push a button and magically everything would work uh the way that we wanted to do but it doesn't that's also why there are so many self-help books out there and so many productivity books and the truth of the matter is they all have the same flaw and that is that they were written by somebody else oh i was going to say and they're all bad oh well yes they are all bad but you know it's fine because you can if you enjoy reading them and it come into it knowing that they're bad but not bad they're they're not going to be the perfect uh solution i'm comfortable with saying they're bad and and and then this is why the information that we're giving you right now right now may help you three years from now probably bad we're probably gonna go back and look at it and be like oh man that was really working back then it's not working for us right now we're gonna have to do something different okay but no no i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna stop you right there i'm gonna let you finish but yeah the on-says album was the number one album of all time but also the the self-help these productivity books are not bad in and of themselves because there can be things that tickle ideas in your brain that can help you do something for example the idea of bullet journaling in and of itself exactly the way that writer Carol Carol like prepped it it does not work for me but this idea of using a notebook and putting the date and having you know my appointments and to do lists underneath it does work i don't need fancy like pretty layouts i don't need future planning in it because that doesn't work for me but pieces of it can the trick of the matter is is to go into it understanding that what you are reading is a fantasy it is a in the event of everything being perfect it's type of a situation and in the event that you can give yourself the grace to mess it up and be patient with yourself yes oh my gosh that's that's the most important thing and that you're not a failure because somebody's perfect process doesn't work for you because it spoiler it doesn't work perfectly for them either which is why they have to write the second book yeah that's why they have to write exactly again that it's difficult to be a productivity guru because you're supposed to write about being productive but your life and your job is productivity like how do you it sounds exhausting it's what it does it sounds absolutely exhausted and I much prefer our vibes of being real and doing other things and using that to you know turn around and help support are like what we actually do so this is this is your your message to say that however you take notes is is good and if you need ideas on other options to take notes sure go read a book and get ideas and try something out but once again just to remember remember that however your brain works is great you are glorious and awesome and trying to be better at what you do or what you want to do by adding you know upping your productivity is not a bad thing just give yourself forgiveness and grace and make sure that you know that you whatever you get done is valid and that's good for you yep yep all right so I think are we good with that is that a good topic ending I mean I took some notes so I feel like I feel like we've we've done what we've we set out to do excellent now where are you gonna put them are you gonna put them in the in the show notes no they're in my notebook they'll they'll not go anywhere else okay cool cool well then what about your connection for the next fortnight oh my connection been given that one I'm all over as we were talking um yeah this one's this one's tough uh the reason it's tough is because like a lot of stuff happening right now um one thing that I did not do or that I have not done in the last few I think it's been over a month is go get um mani petty and I was just talking to my daughter who was like hey I like I like you're the the paint that you got on your nails uh and I look down and it's all like chipped and cracked and scraped and half missing on some of the digits and I was like yeah probably need to go get a new one get another one done soon so uh yeah next my next conduit mani petty happening self-care ain't selfish yeah self-care is needed love it excellent what about you uh I as I hinted in my um connection check uh I sent a lot of things to good will there are many boxes that I have not even looked in that I have not touched which means that I don't need whatever's in them so I am going to take them to goodwill to be potentially enjoyed by someone else but most importantly sorted by someone else to see if they need anything without being worried about whether or not I'm missing out now I will be going through and like making sure there's no money or like self identifying you know letters or random stuff that needs to be kept but with the idea that I'm not going to say oh what if I maybe need this in the future because spoiler alert I'm not gonna need it you ain't gonna need it Agni ain't gonna need it so here we go that's what I'm gonna do I'm going to get rid of the boxes that are on one side of my wall in my living room and just get get them they're done they're gone I don't need them I don't need the stuff in them I don't need it you can clear it yeah and our train enthusiast of the show Ralezy says new connection have fun make the most of it maybe a second holiday for the first holiday jump back into the swing of things when it's all

only Erica and Sun and Sun wow I can't answer it she says in parentheses phrase so you can just read it without swapping pronouns and verb tenses which I love uh it's Erica's first new connection is it a super long time before you're becoming a member because she procrastinated or is it a super long time after becoming a member because she procrastinated or because she had an anxiety over picking

come in and I I messaged Erica and I was like thank you for putting this comment in here too because I know that there are some conductors that are listening to this show and are concerned and worried about sending in their first connection and so I love that this comes out lace bear the anxiety behind it and I adore that she has been vulnerable with us and shared this this thing so as a listener and as a host here we are going to support her in picking her of the show name we've already sent out a couple options to her if you have ideas for what Erica's of the show name should be you know no pressure let it you know send it over giving her some ideas could help her pick it otherwise you know as of right now Erica of the show is perfect because that is her name and she is the first one here and in our show so I cannot wait to hear how you did and thank you for editing my terrible uh dnd eing miss I have a suggestion um since tpk's logo is like the tpk language with like a dragon on
