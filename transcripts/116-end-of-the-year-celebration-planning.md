 And we do a show before I strangle you. For legal reasons, this is a joke. From RelayFo, you're listening to ConduOt. The show we ConduOt are our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to ConduOt, the show that might threaten violence every once in a while. I mean, I guess, I'm Jay and with me is the one who has the best advice in terms of proposals and gifts and stockings and stuffings. It's Kathy Campbell. Hi, Kathy. Hi, Jay. God. If you're wondering why I am already frustrated with Jay, you need to become a member of ConduOt because this has been one of the episodes that is very much like half of the people listening who are super conductors will be like, oh, yes, this is class of Kathy and Jay. And then the other listeners will be like, well, I guess Kathy, so I can't really understand. Yeah, no, it's very true. It's very true. And I'm out here supporting Jay's wife. So you're welcome, Brittany. I adore you and you deserve the best. What happened in this week in the discord? This week, in fact, just the last 24 hours has been chaos in the hashtag show followup channel, where we went into deep, deep discussions on what constitutes a hoodie, which if you ever wanted to be a part of a live robot or not, you are more than welcome. There are constantly those conversations. And yeah, it's a lot of fun. And some interesting things develop. MBAs, is this minimum viable hoodie? Is this? What? I'm just I'm looking through here and I'm looking at some of the yes, I just see MBA. If I keep seeing MBAs, I'm guessing minimum viable hoodie is the acronym here. I mean, I feel like MBAs. I think it's snoot is a hoodie. I think I agree with any any article of clothing that has a hood covering with the two chords on the side. In my opinion is a hoodie. Okay. And I do think it is important that the two chords are there. Because I think if you don't have the two chords or the chords fell out in accounts, but like I think anything that doesn't isn't a hoodie, it is a thing with a hood. Anyway, yeah, that was the discord. Lots of awesome hoodie, hoodie thoughts. In the co-working, let's see. Kathy yelled at Jay. What else is new? Yeah. Yeah. This time because I might be traveling again. Well, I'm definitely traveling, but that's fine. We started talking about what's going to happen next summer. And if you're not a super conductor, hey, next summer, you just got to wait and see. You had to wait and find out. I know. We'll announce, yeah, we'll announce it before hand for sure. Well, we'll not be a super conductor only. Yeah, we also talked to people about using their phone as a camera and stuff. And that was pretty fun. But there were other conversations and they were all great. I was. We definitely worked as well. Yeah, honestly, I think I actually got a lot done that day. Good. Yeah, if co-working with us or hanging on the discord to argue what is a hoodie, sounds fun to you. Become a super conductor. Go to I'm a superconductor.com. Letter I letter M letter A superconductor.com and become a member today. Hey, Kathy, what was your one good thing? My one good thing was the fact that we had a dance competition two weeks ago. And many soup my child injured their knee during warm up. And we were really scared because it was hurting a whole heck of a lot. And it was staying swollen and all of these things. Good news is it's not fractured. It's just deeply, deeply bruised. And if you have ever bruised your knee, you know how painful it is. And so good news is it's not fractured, but still in recovery and it's been about a week and a half. Oh yeah, no that's very good to hear that it's not fractured. Yeah. My new thing, side new thing, nameless was on the show and that was pretty fun. And then Steven thought that Kathy was nameless. That's hilarious. Yeah, that was a great moment in which like I'm pretty sure as you were explaining it to him, like he was like yeah, uh-huh sure Kathy. Yeah, whatever you say. I know. I laughed so hard at that. If you don't know what we're talking about, if you are a member of any show on Relay, you can, uh, because you can listen to a very special podcast, uh, called Spotlight, where I tend to talk to people. And in November, the spotlight was discussing, um, kind of things that we were thankful for. And nameless sent in a lovely, lovely, sweet moment. But of course, use the word nameless, uh, for his name because that is his name. Uh, and um, yeah, it was, it was kind of funny because I really liked the fact that he didn't believe that it was a thing. Yeah, I mean, it's good to hear Kathy's all to count chatting with us, you know, every single week, but you know, hey, we can only do what we can do. Hey, it's time for the connection check, um, zap. Kathy, how did you do? I actually did well. In fact, this was, so my connection was to actually load the products that I needed to do, which was my connection the last fortnight. And I couldn't manage, couldn't get around to it. But I actually did it within 24 hours of recording the episode. Um, and I felt really good. And more importantly, we've sold several of the items. So that was great. Right. Um, very cool. I'm going to talk a little bit more in detail about my connection and the main topic. But I would say that the, uh, the task of regaining control, um, um, if I start by asking the question of what, um, then I, the answer fluctuates, depending on what it is. So I gained control of some things and I lost control of other things like why there's randomly and now I cat in my house. Um, I would, I would be hard to be able to say I had control when literally, my family came home with another heartbeat and I was like, what is happening? Um, what about our conductors? Yeah, our conductors did pretty great this past fortnight. So Carly, our artist of the show says green heart. I don't remember what my last connection check was. So let's just say I did it. We love that energy. Love it. Especially if you're, if you're winning like that where you're like, probably even knocked on my connection like way to go. Yeah. The awe of the show, uh, says green heart. I have been and will continue to rest and recuperate feeling a lot better than I was. Thank you for the well wishes last show. Um, I missed this part. Um, but I'm glad you got better. Yeah, uh, was hospitalized. It was, it was not green, but doing better, which we love to hear. You like to hear that? Our checklist enthusiast of the show Mike says previous connection green check marks start working on my new yearly theme for 2026. Pick the name and objectives for my new yearly theme. Well done. I've just started picking things around in my brand for my own. So, uh, we'll see how it goes. I also started working on the jazzees for this year. Um, it's going to be, it's going to be an interesting one. I feel like there was a lot that happened this year. It's like a lot everything and nothing. Yeah. It's very wild. Um, okay, our soprano of the show, Deb O says green heart had a nice, relaxing week off for Thanksgiving. Nice. Our shark of the show Chris says my last connection was to make an effort to listen to more music. I have been doing this for the last fortnight plus and I do think my mood has improved. Yay. I love when a theory is proven by the, and it makes you feel better. Our shark of the show Chris. That's what I just read. No, our robot engineer of the show Aiden says, I can't read that. It's a little, it's a flirty. Yeah, a little bit flirty. Practicing my French went pretty well, but then I went to Quebec and proceeded to only need it at one Tim Hortons, which I guess is a very Canadian thing to have happen. So I'll take it. We, we, we indeed. Our carl of all trades at the show Carl says connection check, green check mark. I'm posting a check before the show. And despite all the unexpected ugliness that has happened, I'm making forward progress. Yes, progress is valid. Progress is great. We love it. Our identical twin of the show errands says green circle. I missed the last connection check, but I've been keeping on top of freelancing and have done most of my holiday shopping too. Like most of us here. Yeah. Our fish bear of the show, fishie Kai says connection check red circle. Didn't make any home improvement progress. Life is busy. The projects will still be there in January. Yes, I love this mindset too. Like the connections are here to kind of give you the support that you need, but not to be angry or like completely lose your mind if you don't succeed. It's okay to say, you know what? Now it's not the time. And that's 100% okay. Well done. And our nameless of the show nameless says got the end of the year celebration invitations printed and distributed. I saw celebration invitations and I was like, my brain is going to mess this up. You did great. You did great. Our tech podcast listener of the show, Pillix says connection check green apple. I did the tires. Hooray! And our Canadian trivia card enthusiast of the show. Hey, Erica, I just got a new game. Never mind. Anyway, green heart, something like six months ago, I wanted to clean my makeup brushes and the dishwasher filter. And I finally did it. Hey, I love that feeling. I love that. Yes. Amazing. I want to know, did you do what was it like a I need to do this still or was it what was my last connection and when was it? Oh goodness, let me do that now. I would love to know like what was the sequence of doing the things and then remembering to come back six months late, you know, six months and then being like, oh yeah, I did that. Totally did that. Yes. This episode's brought to you by y'all. We like y'all. Y'all are cool. Um, also youngs, y'ins, and all them. They're great. Those that listen to the show, those that support us, those that do the connections and things like that. You're all very, very, very awesome. So to all of y'all, y'ins and y'ins, thems and thems, thank you. We appreciate you. Yeah. Hey, Kathy, do you hear the clanking of champagne glasses and the low mingle of the company holiday party at the end of the year? Hi. I mean, my holiday party is for my company is just kind of me sitting in the corner going, woo, but that's okay. That sounds so sad. No, I have a lot of other company parties, including this one. Yeah. So we figured as a holiday party, it would be maybe a quicker show, but one where we, we kind of talk about what our plans are for the end of the year. Now, don't worry, this isn't the last conduit of the year. We actually have two more. Yeah. I thought that was wild. So yeah, there's going to be, there's going to be our actual end of the year review. The one where we do our final systems check using our systems check throughout the rest of the year. And I would argue maybe our next, so maybe we'll have an end of the year review and then we'll have an end of the year systems check. Because I would love to take all the transcriptions that I take and just be like, hey, summarize the year for us. Yeah, I love that. That would be fun. Obviously, the end of the year, the end of the calendar year tends to be one of the times that might be a little bit slower. It would be one of those times where maybe there are some projects that you've been putting off, or maybe you have some things at home that while you're taking maybe a little bit of time off, you might tackle. So we're just going to talk a little bit about ours. So hey, Kathy, what is your end of the year looking like? Yeah, so one of the things that I've been meaning to do since we moved in almost gosh, like three years ago is I have a lot of boxes still. We don't have a garage. So right now they're kind of sitting in the corners of my, like living room specifically. I know, this is something that has been bothering me like low level. And I know that it's difficult for me to wrap my brain around. But I sat this morning actually when I was doing my like morning journaling and stuff, I actually sat in my living room and was like, okay, you know what I'm going to do? And after I did my journaling, I sat and I did a brain dump of specifically what needs to happen with each of the things that I could see in my living room. For example, I have a pile of cardboard boxes that were extras left over from the multiple holiday gifts that I send out. We don't need them. We're not going to, I'm not going to be sending the same really gifts again. And there's such strange sizes that it's not even something that I can, that I will use for anything else. Like it's, it's like bottle shaped. And I'm just like, this is not, this is not something that needs to fit in my house. So I'm going to go onto our by nothing Facebook page and say, hey, here's some freebies. Earlier, like last Friday, Saturday, I don't know, some point in the in the past week. I got rid of the two air conditioners that had been sitting in our living room for a while. One of them was it working and the other works, but it needs a new tube. And I was like, you know what? I could sell them probably. But I don't need to. And so I was able to kind of bless somebody who can put a smaller amount of money to replace the pieces, possibly even fix the broken one. And I don't have to think about it. It's not in my process anymore. And yeah. And so I, this is kind of, this is more than just a fortnight situation. This is more than just a like doing this by the next conduit because it's going to take a lot more time, a lot more energy. And I definitely need to give myself that space. And so this is kind of like that end of the year to clean it up, but also so I can put up Christmas. I'm okay. Of Christmas state, like comes up closer to the holiday, putting up the treat, especially since who knows what the animals will do to it. But having having the space, I think, is really helpful. And getting that kind of cleaned up. And so that's where I'm putting my concentration for the rest of this month. And kind of using the time that I have fewer projects for my clients to kind of concentrate on myself a little bit. I love the like taking this time to focus on yourself. I kind of, I put that in like my connection with regain control. The, just the overall like control of life and the things around us always feels I don't want to say always feels absolutely nutty until it doesn't, but I mean, I'm it's been such madness that I, you know, similar to you a lot of what I'm looking forward to is like adjusting and fixing small things or getting rid of things like I would, I would really like to it's funny. I organized my office. And then now I'm like, I need to reorganize it again. I need to move stuff around. And there's there's just so much happening. And I, I don't want my entire like one, I've got like a couple of weeks off at the end of the year, which is going to be great. Rub it in. I mean, I don't, I'm trying to remember when they actually start to be honest because I'm pretty sure like, I get back from my trip in a couple of weeks. And then I'm just like not doing anything. But it is, it's, it's in that moment that when I have that, oh, and I was not that bad. Well, yeah, it is that bad. It's just that the week that Christmas falls on and then the week that New Year's falls on them off. But there is, there's like this, this feeling of fighting, putting a bunch of stuff on my plate for that, that time. It's like, oh, I could do this. I could do this. I could do none of those things in relax and find a data relax and just kind of chill for a little bit. I don't know how well that will work. I find myself slowly but surely feeling like I'm losing, I'm still losing control. Just of all the things happening around me, one of the things that we talked about, Kathy, we talked about during the co-working was maybe getting a like a personal assistant or something. Yeah. Like something like outsourcing some of the smaller digital tasks to a personal assistant that could handle those things. I've never wanted to consider like some of it is actually for my job. So I was like, ooh, if I just hire someone to work for me, is that illegal? I mean, not necessarily. It depends on your rules and like what specifically you have there. Probably should be a conversation with my employer before I go around the tasks of people to do stuff for me. But it's one of those things where I spend, I spent some time reading. Yes, I text Kathy and Kathy what thought I was like dying or something. I thought you were kidnapped, honestly. Literally, I'm reading a book. What? Yeah. The worst part was that Brittany's response was the exact same thing. Yeah, because we know you. Just like, what is that? Is that a book? Anyway, the book is called On Repentance and Repair. It's by Rabbi Dania Ruttenberg. It's written by Rabbi. I would not consider it to be like a religious book or anything like that. It just talks about something from a historically like Jewish perspective on the idea of repentance and repair and empathy and things like that. This wasn't a topic in the book, but as I've been reading it, it's been therapeutic in some ways of how I have not treated myself very well and trying to do some of the work there to maybe be a little bit kinder to myself. Yeah. Also, it's a paper book. It's not even a digital one. Wow. There we go. I've been ribing. That's amazing. But also, just trying to listen a lot and understand there's a great episode of a show that I like to watch our listened to called Hood Politics. Yes, it is a politics show. It is not like any other politics show that probably anyone else would listen to maybe. I don't know what people's ideas are for things, but the last episode was a couple of folks that I'm very familiar with that I followed for a long time. I have met personally the host propaganda who I met at like a food truck in LA one time. The best way to meet your heroes is that a food truck in LA. Very much a very cool person. The other person was someone that I know we don't talk too much about like religion and stuff here, but someone that I used to go to church with a few years ago. And they are a very popular YouTuber. Their name is Glen Henry, but they go by belief. And their YouTube channel is called Belief in Fatherhood, which talks about parenting, like black parenting and things like that. And he just wrote a book. And in his book, he was kind of talking about just some of the things of being a parent, being a husband, some of the stuff that I've kind of been aligned with. And then a prop whose long phrase, long stage name is propaganda. But prop mentioned something that he got from therapy, which was, you know, you can be a shelter or you can be a storm, but you can't be both. So like in moments, you can come in and disrupt everything and be the storm or you can you can be the shelter. And this is something that I've been trying to embrace more. So while I'm also giving, so while I'm giving myself a lot of time to be kind to myself, I'm thinking more and more about how I can be kinder or be more of a shelter to my family and that I'm the one that is in the house more than anyone else. So when that happens, it's like, okay, well, while they're gone, instead of waiting for them to come back so that I can bombard them with things, maybe I can just take care of some of those things myself and give them a easier transition from being outside the house to inside the house. So while they were gone, they were gone for a while. Oh, nameless, we're going to talk about some propaganda. That's going to be fun. But while they were gone, they went to Illinois for Thanksgiving. And while they were gone, I took care of some stuff, I took care of fixing some door knobs that needed to be replaced. And then also putting up the Christmas tree. I didn't decorate it. I just put the tree itself up. That way, J. Anne got home and was so excited to be like, oh, the tree is up. I can... Yeah, it's Christmas. Exactly. We can start decorating and putting the lights up and stuff. So yeah, just this time that is slowing down for me is kind of being a moment where I can really try to reflect on myself, try to reflect on who I am kind of in the space and how I... I don't know the phrase, but like how I'm maybe making the space around me a little bit better, a little bit more peaceful. Not like it's a war zone, but it's you know, it could be chaotic when people come home and they're doing... The family units are family uniting and moving and doing all these other things. So yeah, I'm thinking about that, but I'm also thinking about how to give myself rest. Good. Good. Yeah, I think that's important to make sure that you're kind of hitting all of those pieces and resting but also being getting done what you need to do and additionally making sure that you are looking at kind of the other people in your life because it's not just a life that is, you know, what you're currently living in. Like you are not an individual, you live in a world where other people exist and there's a balance for sure between being too much of a people, please, or and also being able to being seen as too selfish because you're only doing what you want to do, especially if you share a house and live with multiple people. And yeah, it's a balance for sure. And I'm definitely more of the people please are out, but I'm trying to be better at that. One of the things you mentioned when we were thinking about this as well was giving yourself the accolades for the things that you've done. Yes. Can you go into more detail about that? Yeah, a lot of times, especially at the end of the year, it can be difficult to remember the good things that happened. It can be difficult to kind of recognize and acknowledge the the joys. I mean, you might remember, oh, I had a really good time on this trip or or something similar. You know, we had fun doing this or I got a new job, yada yada, but it can be more difficult to to see like the little things that maybe you would celebrate if you had like a moment to sit and and to think of. Part of what I do every month is I try to track each day what happened. And that has really, really helped me because my memory is so bad, like really bad. I don't remember what I did last week, let alone six months ago, let alone the fact that six months ago was not March. That's really hard for me to kind of have that space. And so being able to have an easy tracking, it doesn't have to be something super difficult. I used to do like one line a day in a separate book that became something that I just never did. And so I have just a page in my planner that just has the line for one line for each day. And I just write something there. It's not super fancy. It's not super difficult. And then I also try and kind of track my mood at a very basic level. More of just to kind of have a reflection between the day. And it's really nice to be able to sit and be like, okay, hey, I dig, excuse me, I dig good. It's I sometimes the end of the year can just be like, I am still here, I survived. And that's okay. You know, there's a meme that tends to go around because November is a really difficult month for a lot of people. And it's I'm doing a November challenge and it's get through every day in November, which sometimes that is definitely how it felt. And being able to get through those days is great. I'm so happy that I've gotten through November. And and I'm going to try and end, you know, really celebrate the wins that I did this year. I think it's interesting that the the this just the stuff that I've been I've been like watching and reading and stuff and trying to find has really pushed on more of just like self accountability and like the things that you've done maybe sort of like in a in a good way. Um, for the the super nerdy, um, there's a tool called in eight in, um, that someone is someone has used to automate their process of of doing stand up. And and like, it's an AI like AI AI AI stuff. So like, you know, take with a grain of salt. But the thing that I really liked about it was it used the it used all the stuff that they they use regularly to actually talk about what they did and what they have to do. And I was like, that's so cool. And Kathy, as you were like talking about just forgetting all of the things that you did, I remember a friend of mine used to swear by having like the Excel spreadsheet that has like every little thing you did, like every little positive thing you did. Um, just as a way of saying like Excel spreadsheets do do like a couple of really good things are really good with formulas and they're really good with showing a lot of information. And exactly how much a lot of information really is. So like when they go to the end of the year and they have like five thousand things on there, they're thinking about, wow, in 365 days, I was able to do five thousand positive things. And you know, I think that's, you know, that's kind of important why we we like to do the accountability thing is because we get to celebrate, you know, those moments in which we we we con did it. But like, I think that there is something beautiful there about giving yourself the space and giving yourself a system in which you can acknowledge that you have done something. Um, as you were talking about that, one of the things that I had to write down was I'm afraid of next year. Um, because I I've kind of been in the same position for a little bit. Um, I'm not really do for any kind of promotion or anything like that. Um, but also there's a lot because because my leadership has changed, there's a lot more kind of being put on my plate because I am now the person who has continuity. I've been here the second longest on our team. Um, the person who's been here the longest. Uh, I love them. I don't expect them to be around, you know, much, much longer just due to, you know, age and, you know, their approaching retirement and life stuff. And it's like, okay, cool. You know, there's a lot of folks who are looking at me and going, Hey, give me the history on this. Give me the background on this. Give me the justification based on what we've done in the past as to why we should or shouldn't do this, that in the third, like we were talking about it in our co working about getting a video editor for doing video stuff. And a lot of this was, okay, well, Jay, we're going to trust if you're saying that we need a video editor that it's based on previous experiments that we've tried with video in the past. And we also expect that, you know, you would be a good person to help us figure out who that video editor should be. And I was just like, uh, like, I didn't, I found out earlier this year that we had discretionary spending to afford a video editor and that no one had ever talked about it publicly or loudly until like, literally, I was in charge of the budget. And it was like, what's this money for? So like, there are, there are now things that next year, like, I'm already, I'm already doing the work for next year. I'm already trying to ping people and say, Hey, I need you to like make, you need to connect with this person and then hand this stuff off to them. Or hey, you know, we've got these events happening. We need to get this stuff on the road. Like, Oh, hey, we're I'm going to find the money for all of this, you know, as well. So like, there's a lot of stuff that I'm, I'm putting on my plate. But I feel like the thing that is nice about this is that for a couple of years, I've gotten better at saying, Hey, I need help. Um, I think the thing that I've got to get better at is every time someone helps me, it frees up time for me to do something else. And what it should be is I should be able to just like do nothing instead. In this time where things are slowing down, it's great to be thinking about all this stuff. It's great to be rewarding yourself. It's great to give yourself a shout out. It's great to ask for help. It's great to do all those things. But the work that you're putting in in this time, some of it should probably be like semi permanent so that you're not, you're not like, I did this work because the work needed to be done. And then on top of that, it's like, Oh, but that work is going to just pile up again. Like instead, it could be, I put in the work that now I'm able to be like, I don't want to say 1% happier or 1% better because that's a book in the book is on meditation. And it's not a bad practice, but also, yeah, there's some marketing garbage around that. Um, but to be just to like improve kind of your situation slightly and do the thing, do the stuff. I take the time, take the slower times to do the things in a way that they're not going to be a burden to you in the future, whether that's they don't ever happen again, or you prepare yourself to handle it in a simpler or maybe stronger way before. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that that makes sense. Um, and I think it's it, it, it, there's no, okay, I feel like I, we say this anytime we talk about something like this, but there's no correct way to do things necessarily. There are incorrect ways like do not propose to your partner on a holiday that has gifts and only do the ring. Just throwing that out there. I think I got something else too, but I don't remember. Oh my goodness. So long ago. Wow. You didn't, you know what? No, we're not talking about this. We're not doing this. Um, but the important thing to remember is that you need to go with what works for you. And that's the important part is making sure that you know kind of where you are and what you do. Um, and what you need because that is the only way that you can really be successful with what you're, you're, you're trying to get done. I, I put in there in the chat kind of the, the idea when I was talking about the, the mini stand-up thing and the automation and things like that is I, I have a friend, another friend who who automates writing and newsletter to himself. I mean, other people can, can read it too, but I think it's mostly for himself that just talks about like here are all the things that I did in the last month. Yeah. And it like reads, it reads like all of their like social media posts and blog posts and stuff. And then I think it also looks at some of their like career stuff. And then they publish it. And it's, as it reads, it reads very much like, oh, I did these things. Oh, and then I did these things. And then don't forget that I did these things. So again, it's like a, it's like that general reminder of like, oh, no, a lot of stuff got done. And a lot of stuff does get done. And again, I think that it's, it's a really, really hard to see that in the thick of it. So maybe in this slower period, take that time to to see and realize how much you got done throughout the year, give yourself in a distinguished service member award or something, make up your own awards like the JZs. And take that time to think about all of the amazing people and experiences that you had this year. And you have put it on a website or something. I don't know. That's what I do. Yeah. But also it's okay if you don't, if you just write it down on a post and note or even just sit and think about it, you know, it doesn't have to be anything too performative. It doesn't need to be anything extreme or you don't need to make a YouTube video for it necessarily. But just just making sure that you're giving time to you to think about it can be really helpful. You know, there's there's so much for, never mind, because I forget websites actually exist. Sometimes you gotta be careful. Actually, it's funny because there's a service called MeTube. So I was going to say there's so much talk about YouTube, but there's never, there's never any time to recollect or MeTube. Oh my goodness. But then MeTube is like a YouTube downloader. Thanks. Gotcha. But also if you do want to do a YouTube video or TikToks or something to go in and like sit and have it be public, that is also 100% okay. Yeah. A part of Me disagrees with Kathy on the like, I think that you should make it special. Use a special pin or something do something fancy because it'll give you something to look forward to. Yeah. But only only you know what that that like making it special is is totally different than making putting too much energy into it that may exhaust you because Jay does the JZ's. You feel like you have to also do something that way. Yeah. And and it's important to kind of see what feels right to you, which is kind of the name of our game in the entire life. Well, I mean, that is the whole purpose of the show is that like, hey, we do it this way, but we only tell you how we do it in hopes that it will inspire you to figure out what does your way look like. Yes. Like it doesn't have to be ours. Yep. Hey, speaking of your way, what are you going to do in the next conduit? I am going to put up the pictures. I have I used to have a gallery wall at two houses ago, up our stairs. And I also had one in our last last home. And now that the gigantic antique shelf that we had fell off the wall and broke along with everything, well, not everything. Most of the things that were on that shelf, I've decided that this wall is now going to be for not that I'm going to do it to where it is on my wall. So I'm going to put up the pictures. Um, mine's going to be pretty easy. I've got to plan the jazze's. Yeah. It's into the year. I got to think about all the things the jazze's have have come and gone and done so much. Funny enough, um, earlier this year, I I purchased jazze's.com never did anything with it. So that might that might be a part of it. But, uh, yeah, the jazze's for 2025 need to be figured out. Um, also I do love that if I just type in jazze's, it's, it definitely shows up a couple of times in, uh, the script. So they they do think, oh, you meant j's j's keys. And I was like, no, j does not ski at all. Oh, j's j's j's j's the musician. Nope, not at all. Yep. But, uh, yeah, it's, it's definitely, definitely a moment for, uh, reflection. Reflection. Yes. I'm, I'm, I just pulled up the last year's jazze's, which you should totally check out because Kathy's mom's on it. Yeah. Kathy is the only, I feel like the, the soup family are the only family members in which more than one family person is on the, is, is awarded. Um, as it should be. Yeah. That said, I think there is going to be a second time winner this year. Um, just given how some things happened. Um, interesting. So I'm excited. But that'll that's for another episode.

I'm sorry Aiden. Robotics engineer, the show Aiden says work on figuring out a better nighttime routine. Um, sleep, sleep at night is good unless you work at night and then sleep during day is fine then. Um, I would say the tango is not a good routine to try. Um, or neither is the wall to the salsa. Um, but just sleep. You're so funny. Our carlable trades of the show Carl says next connection, I need to find the energy in fortitude to both handle work emails that cause anxiety and support my daughter during a time where her neurotics is making it difficult for her to cope with negative situations.
