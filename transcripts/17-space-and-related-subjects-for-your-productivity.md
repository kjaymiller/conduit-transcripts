From Relay FM, you're listening to Conduit, the show where we conduo our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that helps give you space and related subjects for your productivity. This episode is brought to you by DevonThink.
I'm Kathy and I want to introduce the amazingness that is the J-Man. The J-Man, is that like an off budget superhero? It is a very on budget superhero because you come and save the day. Awesome. I am happy here. I come to save the podcast. Okay, now let's just keep going.
All right, we're going to start out. We're going to start out with some shout outs and I first off want to give a great shout out to the incredible people that have joined the Discord and been brave enough to put an introduction that mentions Conduit.
Like seeing this show that we do as like a tag in the introductions, like that it just blows my mind that people are listening. I love you, but also that they're here to hang out with us. So we appreciate every bit of that.
And if you are coming to the Conduit or if you're a listener of Conduit and in the Discord and nervous to like get out there, maybe you're just reading or following along, you can do this. You just hang out at just an introduction, say, hi, I'm so and so and then do Conduit.
We'll come, we'll glomp on and give you all the love and support that you might need to kind of relax and hang out with these cool people. Yeah, it's super awesome to see that there are folks out there that are getting brought into the madness that is our community.
And I love the fact that just seeing the icon in our Relay FM Discord makes people go, what a bus, what a bus, our inner like tribal urges come out to just like, yes, yes, yes, you love this person. It's true, it's true.
All right, Jay, what about you? What's your shout out? Well, speaking of people doing amazing things, I have a shout out for a colleague of mine that goes by the name of Brittany Joyner. She is amazing.
I found out about her when I got to help her with the conference talk for an event that I was helping to run. And somehow we, I went to, I tried to let her know that her video was now on YouTube and I was trying to find the link to the video because Jay made a mistake in that process.
And when I did, I came across her YouTube channel and her YouTube channel had tons of videos about productivity and things like that. And I was like, how have I never seen this before? And we started talking and there was a lot of productivity discussion and stuff.
So I want the conduit community to go hang out. There's going to be a link in the show notes to go give a subscribe, thumbs up, a like, all that stuff, ring the bell, all the YouTube e things that we don't have to worry about. Because she's still putting out videos regularly.
I think she put out like three or four videos last week. So be sure to go give her the same conduit love and support that you give us every other week. I am so excited. I'm super excited to hear because let's move on to the connection check. Zap! Nice.
Jay, what's, how did your connection do? So I did the thing that you probably don't do and that's give people on the internet permission to ping you whenever they can. And no, not many people took me up on the offer that that's okay because it, it revealed a lot of things.
One, people are busy, people are respectful, and people want you to have healthy boundaries set up. And I love the fact that our community is one, you can trust them with that kind of power and know that it's not going to be abused.
But also the fact that when you try to, to nag and plead for them to bother you, they're just like, no, I will stand firm on this.
I will, this is the mountain, I will die on, and I will just make sure I will, I will defend your privacy, your time, your energy, your tire, I will defend your entire tire all the way until the end.
So it was a check in that I didn't really have to do anything, but it was also a bigger check in that I found that the community that we work with is absolutely amazing. I mean, this is no surprise whatsoever. It's been, it's been an interesting fortnight.
I had some heightened anxiety last week, which was really interesting. Especially because it turns out that it was connected to medication.
 So we got that a little bit more stabilized, but it was really nice being able to just hang out in the discord and read things and, and know that it was kind of a safe place to, to, to be present that I could be involved without feeling like I needed to have conversations because I just am like, let me, let me let the break room flow over me.
Let me let the discord flow over me in a way that was really helpful. So thanks everyone. And we didn't mention this at the, at the top, but if you want to become a member of this amazing community that we keep talking about, you can do so by becoming a member at relay.fm slash conduit.
And from there you get access to the discord, you get access to all the love and energy and good vibes that this community gives on such a regular basis. Absolutely. And speaking of good vibes, my connection was to take a full lunch hour each work day away from the desk.
And let me tell you, this is something that I'm going to be continuing more than just this fortnight. Today is the only day that I didn't get a full hour. And that's because I had to come and get ready for conduit. So it was worth it. Basically taking time, I hung out in my hammock and I ate lunch.
And then the trick here that I learned was when I'm done eating, I don't immediately go back to work. Yeah. I stayed that full time to really take a break, take a moment. This was super helpful when I was having those anxiety periods and like just couldn't, I could not even as we say.
And I am really hopeful that this is something that I will be able to continue to do because I saw such a huge benefit in how it helped the latter part of my day. I can't wait to talk about more about different spaces and environments and things. Space. Yeah, but that's for the future.
So instead, let's check in with our conductor's connections. You want to start, Jay? Yes. And mine I add, there are so many connections. And we promise we would read them all. And that is because you love your connections and we love you.
But we're going to start with Sky connection check while some of my habits are being rebuilt. I'm back on track. Yay. And mostly recovered from my lost quarantine week. Let's first say, Sky, I'm glad that you're feeling better. That is also kind of a big deal.
But I'm also glad that you're in the process of rebuilding those habits and getting things back on track. Absolutely. All right, Team Test, the tire advocate of the show, their connection check says green check mark first.
Okay, I need to take a pause here real quick and just say how much I love the different emoji use. We don't have an official like green yellow red emoji and it makes me super happy. So you keep doing whatever like shape you want your color to be.
It's really, it's really fun to see kind of what is is picked. Okay, so Chinta says green check mark. I realize that I really need the new starter on my team to answer whether I spent enough time with them.
However, I think it went well overall and that they're actually starting real worth this week. That on ramp to a new job is so stressful and having someone, it sounds like you have been there to support them in an incredible way that I hope they really appreciate it.
And so I can't wait to please share with us that you when you find out what they have replied and how that helped because I can just imagine that a long, supportive onboarding process is super helpful. Next up is our sloth of the show, Ankenu.
They said, I finally pulled together some of the structure to help get back into my theme rhythm, but a trip to the ER. Oh no, and an unrelated trip out of town. That's all that's good. Thank you for the unrelated. Yes. Thank you. Put a bit of a crimp on my theme activities all the same.
I'm in a better position to move forward than I was. Exactly. This wasn't a step back. This was a step to the side a little bit. And if you know any good dance songs, a step to the side always comes back with a step in the other direction. So yes.
Also, I want to say that when I, it's a good thing I wasn't the one reading Ankenu's connection check because I, my brain put together crimp and theme to say crime. And I was very concerned as to what a trip to the ER and an unrelated trip out of town had to do with crime.
And also why you were putting it on the internet if you were doing a crime. So I very glad. I'm glad you're a man about a connection. Exactly. All right. Next up we have a friend of the show, Maddie, connection check three green circles. Wow.
Who their connection was to review her aims for personal projects. So she feels like she has direction again. And she con did it and did it almost immediately. She went through all of her projects and came up with a direction for each. And feel, feels so full of hope again. This is amazing.
I'm so happy for you. You deserve all of the best and the goodness. And I am excited to see where this hope comes in the future. Next we have our hello of the show connection check red circle. Oh no. For the reason I have not really had, like for the reason I have not really had one.
I've been in quite a rut for January and most of February. But hoping I'm to come out of that now. Friday I met up with some work friends. Most who I haven't seen in almost two years and it felt so normal. It filled me with hope for the future.
Also getting to see their dad on Wednesday for the first time since May. So almost in a year and beyond excited about that. These two things have helped me and made me rethink the important things in life. AKA friends and family. And obviously the most important of that is my wife to be.
Hello, hello of the show. That is amazing. And I love that even though you give this a red circle, I would give you a red orange and green circle because you did a lot of things. A lot of things happened.
But at the end of the day, it all came out better and we all came out better in the end for it.
And why we do this is not only to learn a little bit about ourselves, but to learn with one another to empathize and commiserate with one another and to show that even when life sucks a little bit, we can still do it. Heck to the, I agree 100%.
You got this and the future is going to be helpful for lots of people. I'm so excited. Starting for Sof, our Oracle of the show who's got the yellow circle.
I've written most of the introduction to my book, but I still, but it still needs some editing to finish, hoping to get it done in time for conduit, but if not very soon after.
Now I'm fairly certain that I saw a little note that said the introduction was finished, which is super exciting because you've got it done. So can we change this to a green circle instead of yellow because I think you con did it. So well done you. Yeah, you did.
Friend of the show down under connection check green heart, oh, heart squad. Now we're going to have circle squads, hard squads. It's been a while, but I'm getting stuck into work and really enjoying it so far. The last few weeks, I've also been able to finish a craft project, which is also nice.
There we go. I love it because you're getting some of that time back and the transition period is starting to become the normal C period, which means that it's time to think about a bunch of stuff and rethink a bunch of stuff and life's all about rethinking things, isn't it? Ab.
So freaking loately. In fact, I've been doing pretty good at working, but being kind to myself, though I had to postpone a trip to this upcoming weekend due to the storms and haven't got as much work done as I would have liked as I've been having difficulty focusing on it.
That, believe me, totally understand, especially with those incredible storms and that really stressful, hey, I hope I don't get swept away by the wind. I'm so proud of you of being kind to yourself that is obviously really difficult.
And I love the fact that you recognize, oh, you didn't get as much work done as you wanted to, but you also saw that reason. So I'm so proud of you. And I think this next week is going to be pretty positive for you. And our cube of the show, oh no.
Can you check for the job job stuff? May the interview progress? Feeling good. Yes. I am glad to hear it. I'm glad to hear that things are continuing to progress and that you're feeling good about the situation. So way to go. And as always, you can't do it. Heck to the out.
You know what else you can do? You can't. Can't hang out because this episode of Condo it is brought to you by Devon THING. The flagship product from Devon Technologies. Devon THING is the most professional document and information management application for the Mac.

I love that the last two sponsors that we've had have been ones that I use and I use regularly and are very pertinent to what I'm doing at the moment. This past week, I did my taxes. Yes, I con did it.
What made doing my taxes easier than the nightmare fuel that they usually are was the fact that I had all of the documents that I needed collected in Devon THING.
And quite literally, if they would come in the mail, I would take a picture and then upload it to Devon THING using the Devon THING to go app. Or if they came in by email, I would bring them in and then convert the PDF so that you could actually search for the text.
So then I just had to search for 10 whatever whatever or line 4c on my w2 and have the information that I was looking for quickly and easily. And if for some strange reason down the road, people say, hey, we need that w2 from 2022, I can go bet because it is in Devon THING.

So our topic is space. Space. Space. An environment. And so the reason that this topic came up is that starting tomorrow, I have started a membership with a co-working space.
I've realized that over the past two years of this panorama that I am really missing the opportunity to leave my house to go and work. I used to go when I was feeling the itch or answer or anything. I would go to a coffee shop or a pub or something and hang out just for a couple hours.
Get some really focused work done and be able to come back and just like feel lighter overall. Obviously, I personally don't really feel comfortable doing that as much anymore. I've done it a couple times when I've met with friends and clients.
We've gotten some work done specifically, but I don't feel like it didn't feel right to do it by myself necessarily. And I found a very cute little co-working place that is run by someone who also runs a nonprofit that helps homeless teens, which I'm like, yep, take my money.
It's a cute little house, like just a just a house. So it's a couple bedrooms, one bath, kitchen, everything. It's dog friendly. It's got a porch and they're very strong for the mask thing.
So there's signs all over and all of their guidelines and stuff are like, hey, please wear a mask unless you are the only one in one of the offices with the door closed.
So even if I rented a, like used the boardroom space to have a meeting and there was one other person in there, we'd be wearing our masks, which really was super helpful for kind of my anxiety and soothing my brain a little bit to try and make this as safe as possible.
And the great part is this is, like, it's a month to month option. And I just have the up to two days a week, which is more than enough for me. It's very inexpensive, especially for the free coffee and tea that is included, but also the space and comfy chairs.
And hopefully people will bring their dogs and I get to like have some puppy time. Like that will be super helpful. But it really helped solidify, like I start tomorrow. So we're recording this on to 2222 Tuesday, the 22nd of February. And I start tomorrow.
So when this episode comes out, it will be yesterday. So feel free to check in and see how it went. But I'm really excited. So like this idea that the space that you are in is really important. And also how it can affect your mood and your productivity.
So that's kind of what we wanted to talk about today. So for me, the biggest thing that I picked up on was space can be a very personal thing. But environment is the part of space that we don't control.
Like you have like the two, like, that have to be in some form of balance for you to get things accomplished. You can have your own personal space. And then if your environment isn't conducive to getting work done, it doesn't work.
Also, you can be in the most serene supportive space or supportive environment. But if you're having to adjust to the space that you're in personally, you're still not going to get work done.
So what you kind of have to have is that balance of both of those things where it's like I'm comfortable being in this position and you talked about that with like, hey, I have certain rules for if I'm working in a space, everyone needs to be masked, everything needs to be supportive.
It's great if there's doggo's running around, it's great if there's coffee and tea. But also, I know that I have all of those things at my house. But at the moment, the environment for whatever reasons is preventing me from getting things done.
So I have to seek a new environment where that space can continue to thrive. And I can still continue to accomplish stuff. Absolutely, especially with the home situation, there's, you know, yesterday, there was no school.
So my kid was home coming in and out, hanging out, like asking questions, all those types of things. And I'm just like, it's difficult when there's a bunch of distractions and being able to really sit back and say, I know that I need to get stuff done.
I know that there's some deadlines that I'm missing and not having any external distractions can be really helpful, except for the fact that, you know, I'm still stuck with my internal ones, but that's fine because, you know, it's fine. We'll deal with it.
But not having to, you know, my husband not asking for his water refilled, you know, these are all things that I will prep before I go to kind of have that foundation of care needed for him.
Anything, you know, all of these stages in order to leave means that I am taking care of myself and taking care of others in a way that will let me be the best version of myself. And so I'm going to start with one day a week, probably on Wednesdays and just kind of see how it goes.
 So I'm excited to, I don't know, try restaurants, like eat food that I didn't make and are from different restaurants because it's in a different town and and and visiting places that because there's a bunch of food trucks over there and just kind of like trying different things because I'll be there in the middle of the day.
So of course, I deserve a lunch, you know, it's it's not quite the gray method of weekend Wednesdays, but I think it's going to work for me just kind of a refreshing moment. And the challenge that I've always had with co-working spaces is the everything is right, but it's still wrong.
Like are you kind of worried about that at all? Like they've done everything they can. This is just not a space that I can I can do my best unicornning around. I can't graze like I normally graze here. The grass is different.
I think it's going to be because it's not every day and because it has there's not very many, there's not a ton of people that are there and it's not a cubicle space. So there's like four different really comfy chairs and a couch as well as desks.
So I can kind of find out what will work best for me. And again, because it's not I have no contract. There's no, you know, six month obligation or whatever. If I find out that it's not working for me. Okay, that's fine. Like there's no harm loss.
But having like by scheduling this one day a week, like I even put it in my calendar. So I'm not having any meetings during those days either. So it's just work that I'm doing myself that I can do on my laptop.
I'll have my iPad for a side car and just kind of get specific things done and out of the way that are not not distracting me. I think we'll be potentially really helpful.
It's it's something that I had done very un like not regulated a lot before the pandemic by taking a day that I knew stuff wasn't happening. And so I would just leave and go somewhere else. And so I'm hopeful that by having this so that there's no surprises.
My kid knows that I'll be taking them to school on Wednesdays, which means I'm getting out of the house at a specific time. And that I'll be home in time to be able to take them to dance. Like having this structure of the day, I think will be really beneficial.
And it's it's something that I'm really happy that I can try. So we'll see how it goes. Yeah, I love that you've you've given yourself co working space tasks. Like that's that to me is like the the key to this whole thing.
And I love to talk about some of the things that I do in different spaces and different environments.
Because I feel that that same energy and that like you said, you're not you don't want to be taking a bunch of like calls when you're in a co working space because that not only affects what you're able to get done, but it affects maybe what people around you were able to get done.
But yeah, for me that even becomes a matter of what I do when I do it. And it doesn't always make sense like those that know me know that I I write some code from time to time. And I write my best code away from my desk. And it's weird that because I don't I don't write code every day.
Like that's not a thing that I do every day. Some days I work on talks, some days I do like events and things like that. But if I have to build a thing and get it running, I'm probably going to be in the living room while Bluey shout out to Bluey and all the people that make Bluey.
Um, it's like entertaining my my daughter. And then I'm just sitting there with like, you know, an editor open writing code and doing things with all the stuff happening around me.
And when I am working on a presentation, I need to be headphones on at my desk between this hour and this hour coffee at the ready like ready to go.
And one of the things that happened, you know, in the recent shake up was my my wife when we made the transition into her, you know, being a stay at home parent, which I mean, we worked from home. So no longer working from home parents, I guess. Um, the office got a lot quieter.
And that changed an environment changed how I was able to work. And I think before I was able to write code in here because I had, you know, my wife's phone ringing and her answering the phone and kind of that background noise happening. But now I have to go seek it out.
And I think that that's that's something that I hope that other people can kind of take away from is, you know, we've we've had a couple of folks that have connections and things that are more of, I'm in this transition period.
And if there are things that you're having to transition out of, think about what worked before and how you adjust to make it work for you in this new situation. And maybe that means getting out of your space and going into a new environment where your space is going to be more conducive. Yeah.
And and if you can't necessarily leave this space you're in trying to find a way to tweak the environment that you are able to work at. So maybe put on different music, maybe even like putting it out of a different location.
So playing it on an echo device or on your phone and putting your phone somewhere else. So like the sound is coming from a different location.
 So kind of your your spatial awareness is a little bit different or a different type of music that can kind of release a little bit of your brain in a way that will let you relax and and change up that environment, wearing different clothing, sitting in a different chair, burning a different candle than you normally would or like spraying a scent, something to kind of just trick the senses a little bit to refresh your space can be really helpful.
And all of these tips and tricks or whatever they're all you know stuff that you would read, you know, top 10 ways to tweak your environment to be more productive.
That's not what this is, but like it's more of a hey have you hear some options to try if you need to try and shake things up because we all know brands are special.
 And then the last thing that I really wanted to talk about was what are you taking with you to this space because I know for me if I need to get work done, I have a totem and I don't know for those that have watched the movie inception where each person is supposed to have a totem, that totem is theirs, they know all the things about their totem and only they know about them.
 But having something that puts you or puts your brain into okay, it's time to get this done mode is is really key because again, there are going to be so many distractions, there are going to be so many things and sometimes it's not the it's not the space, it's not the environment, but it's the mindset that you're in inside of that given space or inside of that environment.
And I will tell people for me all I can tell you is my totem is an ink blotter. I can't tell you anything else about that because you will mess up my totem. And I have not seen more than I think five minutes of inception.
I know, but I know all about the totems because I listen to the great show, oh my gosh, the great show, do by Friday, with my co-host from another show, Alex Cox hangs out with Merle Mann. They talk about all sorts of random things, but they also have a challenge, um, that they do.
And one week was to talk about a totem. So that's how I learned what totems were. And so I have I don't have one myself. I have a variety of things that live on my desk that I could probably claim as a totem.
And I think right now I'm going to claim my corgi butt AirPods case just because it's so cute. I had a feeling corgi butts would come into the conversation at some point.
I didn't know why because it seems like kind of a weird topic, but that's the second time in this podcast history that we've referenced corgi butts. I just I just want someone to keep track of that. They're very cute. And they make me happy.
And so ultimate goals is to have one of my co-working co-workers have a corgi to swing by so I can fluff the butt and enjoy that in a non-weird way. I don't know how that's not a weird way to do that. Because I can guarantee that corgi owners know all about their butts. Like that's a thing.
I know we have a lot of corgi owners in the discord. And so they can tell me all about how much they love their corgi butt as well as like how much other people love them. Because there's a loving. That's so cute. Oh no.
I feel like I feel like we've we've done a thing now where there will be more corgi butts than I am comfortable with. In all of the things, but if corgi butts are totally your thing, bring them into your space, bring them into your environment.
Let them shake as now my discord chat is as done and I can't move over to hide the gift of it happening. So happy come come reel it in. All right, we're going to reel it in and let's talk about our connections for the next fortnight. Jay, what is your connection? I don't know.
I go like corgi butts are involved. You get more corgi butts in your life. You've broken me. My not like you broke the spreadsheet though. Oh, not like I broke the spreadsheet. Let's see, my connection is going to be to make a remote space bag.
And the reason being folks next month, I'm going to be traveling a lot. I'm going to be traveling more than than I thought I would be. And because of that, there are going to be like weeks where I'm not going to be in my current space or environment.
And I really need to figure out what that looks like as a like in terms of my productivity and how I'm getting things accomplished. And I don't I don't fully know. I know where I'm staying.
I don't know what that place really looks like, but I know that there will be enough space that I can have a little setup where I can work and do things and maybe even record if I have to. But ultimately, I need to have a remote version of this is mine. And this is what I'm doing.
So my goal is before the next fortnight, which will be one week before I leave for my travels, I will already have an idea of what my remote space kit looks like. That's really wonderful. I think that my connection is going to be an easy one because a lot of stuff coming in.
And it's going to be successfully work at my co-working space. How about that? I like that. Your goal has to be to pet at least one doggo. Okay. So I'm having to get a fluff one corgi butt.
Well, I don't want to put restrictions on that because I'm not really sure how many corgis live in the general area. But pet one new doggo, I think, is a good guess, a good connection. Okay. I like that. And, hey, this is your show. You do the things. Okay.
Let's hear our connections from our conductors for the next fortnight, Jay, whose first up? All right. Sky says, over the next two weeks, they want to make a list of active projects and ideas in order to allow themselves to stop worrying about the ideas. They know they don't have time for. Yes.
Yes. 100% this brain dump it. I love brain dumps as much as Kathy likes corgi butts. I like brain dumps. So you can do this. Heck to the, yeah. All right. Chintas, next connection, sleep. Hoof. Over the weekend.
They had one of the best night sleep that they've had in a long while and it reminded them of its importance. They're attempting to ensure that they try to keep it. Wow. Sleep is important. Holy cow. Yes. When I was having that same anxiety issues, my sleep was also really janky.
And melatonin started giving me a hangover in the next morning. So I agree. Sleep is very good. And you should all do more of it. You can snooze it. Oh, sloth of the show. Ankenu says, uh, plan for the next fortnight is to ease back into fitness routine building.
Uh, pay close attention to what their body tells them and exercise at least eight of the next 14 days with a variety of exercises. Uh, you can fit it. No. No, no, they can do it though. Yeah, you can do it though. All right.
The fancy music boy of the show Ryan says this fortnight, their connection is to do stuff that will help his brain because he's ignored how bad his mental illness has become. And now it's affecting his ability to do the job, which wouldn't, shouldn't be high stress and other things he enjoys. Okay.
So first off, your job can be high stress just because it maybe you think it shouldn't be high stress doesn't mean that it's not valid that it is giving you a lot of stress right now.
Um, so make sure that you give yourself a little bit of forgiveness, especially while while while dealing with um mental health joys. It's not high stress, but it's obviously stressing you out. And so the fortnight stress, stress, yeah, job is job job is stressful. It's okay.
It's okay to be stressed and it's okay to work past it. Uh, and so I'm really proud of you for recognizing that and you can do good things. Friend of the show, Maddie says, I need to get through this month's gardening list.
I've been putting it off, uh, but doing things well now means success later in veggie season. You can prune it. Hmm. Nice. That one I will give you. I can't wait to see all of the delicious veggies that are coming down the way you can grow it.
