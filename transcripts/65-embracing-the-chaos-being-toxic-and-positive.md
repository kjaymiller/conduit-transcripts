From Relay FM, you're listening to Conduit, the show where we conduo our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that wishes you a happy new year. This episode is brought to you by Backburner. I'm Kathy and with me today is the hostess with the mostess.
Jay Miller, hi Jay. And all the Clintons be forgot that it's Conduit time. All the Clintons be forgot? Why are we forgetting the Clintons? It's all the Clintons be forgotten. It's 1990, 1990. Nice, nice, nice well done. Brilliant, brilliant. What did we... Hi, I'm back.
I missed, I missed, I missed y'all, I missed recording this show. What happened last week in the co-working, Jay? So in the co-working space, we just kind of just chatted. Honestly, I felt like it was more water cooler time than co-working time.
But hey, sometimes you just got to have those water cooler moments. Kathy had some issues. Yeah, that's normal, I guess. There was some notification issues. There were some job stuff, there's planning stuff. Yeah, I'm so excited for next year.
We talked about a lot of stuff that's going to happen next year. And if you want to learn more about that or if you just want to come hang out with us, then yeah, you should become a super conductor and do that. I agree.
And one of the other benefits of becoming a super conductor, or remember, in general, is the Discord, which everyone celebrated the holidays by beautiful chaos. And it was wonderful, glorious.
My favorite part was in hashtag wholesome, where everyone was posting pictures of their animals celebrating the holidays, you know, enjoying boxes if they were cats. And it was just very sweet. And it's one of my favorite, favorite channels when, you know, the world gets overwhelming.
You can just enjoy yourself with some animals. So if any of this sounds like fun, you can visit I am a superconductor.com to become a member today. That's letter I letter M letter A superconductor.com. And the URL just got renewed from hover. So happy anniversary to the URL, I guess.
I think that means it's around the anniversary of when we launched the superconductor program. Well, it's been like, one year or two years? I don't even know. I don't even know what is time either way. We appreciate you. And appreciate us.
I'm not sure, but I think we're, are we going to hit 100 episodes next year? Promete, um, math work, conduit, so there's 52 weeks in a year. Okay, no, no, no, no, it's like 24. Ah, boo. Yeah, no, nope, two years. Well, y'all know what to do. We'll hit 75.
So all we need is about like a hundred more people to become superconductors directly to us. And then we can, from there, move the show to weekly. Did I say a hundred? I meant 300, 300 more people. Wow, you're setting some expectations. Yeah, 300.
I feel like I feel like a hundred is actually attainable in the next like few months. Um, so we're going to say 300. There we go. We want to, we really don't want to. Right, we, we would love to, but we don't want to, if that makes sense. Um, so I love that for us. I love that for us.
Uh, so it's time for some shout outs. And my biggest shout out is for Jesse Grossstein for supporting Jay last conduit, uh, being an incredible host. And I thought it was a really great conversation. And I'm sorry that I wasn't here to help you with the connections. You did a great job reading.
Oh my goodness. So many such a good problem to have. Right. I love all your faces. You all are amazing, but at the same time I had to, I had to take my inhaler after that. It was. Oh, oh, oh, sad. Uh, do you have any shout outs? I know you didn't write any down. So Javier, feel free to exit, exit.
Wow. Exit this. Deli, this question. Yeah. No, I don't have any shout outs. I'm glad that my, my co-host with the most is back. And I'm, I'm just, I don't know, shout out to 2023. Um, I'm not going to say it like it was, it was a solid year.
Like, looking back and we'll untow them we'll talk about it later, but like, like a lot of stuff happened for me in 2023 that made it nice. But then like also, I'm sure next year is going to be a lot, maybe a lot more in the world of conduit.
We say maybe a lot less, which will help us be more maintainable. But who knows? I'm just, I'm excited for next year in general. And I, oh wait, no, that sounded really ominous. It's like conduits like moving them up. There's, no, no, nothing's changing. Nothing's changing with conduit.
But like, personally, I'm doing a lot and I'm trying to do a lot less, which I think ties into my connection from. Yeah. Yeah. Speaking of connections, connection chap. Exactly. Yeah. How'd you do, Jay? This is the first day and four days that I've touched my computer.
I will throw an asterisk in that and that I did use my computer to watch the football game. But like, it was, it could have been any screen. It was just, it was the closest one and I didn't do anything outside of going to our streaming platform of choice and like watching the game.
That totally counts. Yeah. Yeah. It's a big green check mark for you. What about you, Kathy? I redid my connection from two condits ago to set up my desk and I did set up my desk. I am desking. No, I'm, wow, I'm recording right now from my set stand desk.
However, I think the legs are broken and I currently have a warranty thing open because it's wobbly even though the feet are level and the, the desk is attached. Like it feels wobbly, wobbly, but would do it. It feels wobbly in the actual legs itself. So that's fun.
So I'm not, definitely not standing with it as much as I would like because it's, it's even wobbly in the sit position, which I don't love. But I am enjoying it when I do put it on the stand. So I've had a couple meetings like that where it was on stand, same mode. And that was nice.
Considering the, the gift that the conduit superconductors gave me this year, maybe I can help fix the wobblyness. I appreciate that. However, it's a bliffs warranty department. Oh, yeah, no, no, no, no, this is a requirement.
How did our superconductor, or nope, added our conductors do? I mean, some of them are super. That's true. I don't think that's a, it's not a requirement. Yeah. Just not a capital S. Yeah, it's not a requirement, but also.
Arpithologists of the show, Laura said, Greenheart got to Scotland for my vacation and even spent some time. Wait, what? Spent? Oh, of my slow relaxing time.
I thought it said, spent some time of my show, even spent some of my slow relaxing time giving thought to a simpler system to try out in the new year. I hope that, I hope that that's a recurring thing after the conversation we had with Jesse.
Again, just so amazing that his whole process is like as simple as possible. Simple is good. Our panda of the show, James says connection check, green, weird fish. If you want to make the, oh gosh, hold on, I got a cease. Don't cease watermelon. All right. Connection check, green, weird fish.
If you want to make the gods of productivity laugh, tell them your plans. Last time I said I was anxious about going to a party in a pub because I didn't want to catch anything and ruin Christmas. Turns out I had already caught COVID when I typed that. No idea how.
I've spent the last fortnight in solo quarantine, if being well looked after and missed every single social event of the season, including Christmas day itself, feeling much better now, if still testing slightly positive. Well, let's hope that you get some negativity in your life soon.
Yes, please get well soon. Also, another person needs to get well soon. Our fish bear at the show, Fishing Guys says, being slightly sick, make sleep a higher priority than it might usually be. I did all right. Yes, get better. Yes.
Our code monkey, our code monkey of the show Douglas is also getting over being sick and has a yellow square. Y'all better not give me sick. I get nothing done, but laying in bed and eaking out work.
I think that sounds like a success in that you are still around and we appreciate that you are here and healthy. Please don't give us a virus. Is that how you spoke eaking with just one? I don't know. There might be a sea in there, I think. I don't know. We can figure it out. We knew what it meant.
Just feeling don't matter. Listen, it's not underlined with red, so it sounds like it might work right. I learned something new today. I don't know. Our identical twin of the show, Aaron says, yellow circle holidays have been nice and relaxing in a relaxing time with the family.
Though the day I arrived, I started having a stuffed nose. I hate all of you right now. Don't get me sick. It feels like a cold, but still hoping I don't make my family sick or Jay. I hope I don't make Jay sick either. Yep. Yep.
Our Canadian trivia card enthusiast at the show, connection check, red rose. Red because I didn't organize anything, but it's a rose because I took time to stop and smell the roses. I forced myself to relax on my free days, which was probably wiser. I think that sounds absolutely perfect.
You did a great job. Taking a break. Our shark of the show, one pair of shoes says, my connection was to clean out my garage, not to be able to put in a second pair of shoes. I'm getting put in a car before it snows, made progress on this one before the holiday. And then the family got sick.
Oh no, here it comes. It's going to happen, Kathy. I'm hyperventilating already. You're fine. You're fine because our train enthusiast at the show, Railsy says connection check, green Christmas tree. Sleep is, thank you. Sleep is being actually allocated. Days have been planned and done.
New cortex yearly theme blog post written and uploaded ended up having a moment where I gave up on duo and the streak reset. But that's okay. Like the streak reset, you're not a failure. You're doing fantastic. Also the yearly theme blog post is linked in hashtag self promotion.
And if we remember, we'll put it in the show notes too. I was going to say I want to read it because I never mind. We'll talk about that later. So, um, and then our Oracle of the show. So almost that our Oracle enthusiast of the show. So says yellow heart.
I didn't get as much of the chapter written as I'd planned. I forgot how tiring Christmas would get. But I got some of it drafted. Well, way to go. Nice. That's amazing. And possibly Emma is going to do a blog post, but it looks like it might be too late. So that's okay.
We'll get the next upcoming connection at least. This episode of conduit is brought to you by Backburner. Backburner is the to do app that helps you get things done in a friendly, informal, easy to use way.

Are you not doing the thing? No, I've given up. All right. You know, come on. Can I get one more for the year? Can we just finish out the year strong and then you can say never mind. Okay.
So what Kathy is speaking of is I used to say thank you in a different language or I would say thanks in a different language for reasons that I can't say yet. I am going to do it in finish and I will say you're going to finish strong. There we go. I'm going to say Kitos.
I've probably destroyed that and I'm sorry if I did, but yes, yes, thank you. Amazing. Amazing. All right, Jay. So this is the last episode of 2023. Yay. It's been a good ride. Oh, wait, no, no, no, no. Wait, no, don't be like that. Oh, my gosh.
And that means that it's time for me at least to do my discussion of four. Wow. I'm doing so good right now. My words are great. This is what happens when I take a break. Doing great. Like my brain just is like how how podcasting. I don't know. Clearly.
So anyone that's listened to one of our end of year episodes knows Jay that you don't believe in the truth of a yearly theme. Correct. You're a little bit confused. Trouble maker is what we like to call you. But for our new listeners are potentially new listeners.
Why are you a scrooge when it comes to your leaving? Well, it's because I'm a Grinch at heart. Like, I mean, my favorite Christmas story is the Grinch, although actually we talked about this during our our co-workie session.
Like the Grinch is the best movie if it stops when they're at like the top of the hill and he hears the singing and just let it drop. Well, it's all two problems today and like moves on with his life. But I so I will say I'm not a fan of the New Year's resolution either.
Being someone who has a lot of anxiety and you know deals with things like ADHD, I have learned and a part of this is why conduit is the show that it is is that I've learned that if I just go with the flow, it's easier for me to look back and reflect than it is for me to try to guide or steer.
I'm like the person you don't want captaining any type of a boat. Like, like, we're going to go wherever we go, wherever the wind takes us. That's where we're going. I'm not steering this ship.
But I think that themes while great run the risk of preventing something that could have been truly transformational from happening.
 If I'm already in a position where I don't want that thing to happen or I don't want that, I don't want to be in that position or I don't want to put myself in that position and I'm actively working against it because of some other ideal that I've had for what my perfect year will be, then I would have lost so many opportunities, including one that was like to start a conduit, you know, to do a random show because, you know, two friends were kind of both in the spirit of it would be really cool to do a show.
But if we're going to do it, we're going to do it the right way. We're going to do it this other way. Had I been like, no, it's the year of personal reflection. I'd have been like, I don't have time for a podcast.
What are you doing? So I just personally like to lean in on just the spontaneity of things and let life hit me and make sure that I'm still standing at the end and I'm able to maybe punch back a few times. I mean, it's valid, but also you're wrong. I mean, that's fine. Yeah, perfectly fine.
Mainly, mainly because I'm looking at this and the year that we started conduit was my year to bloom.
It was probably my most successful year to like yearly theme to date in that I did a concentration on things that were kind of scary, looking at things to kind of like solidify and be not be afraid to be seen and not be afraid to kind of stand out and to bloom and blossom.
And that's why I felt brave enough to do conduit amongst other things. So yeah, that like that, that yes, I disagree in your reason why not to do a theme, but that's also because I do do a yearly theme. So like it works out, you know, it all makes sense.
I want to address one comment are our super amazing relay FM archivist and I believe the official historians are out of the show. I was I was trying to find it. I got you. Kate mentions or said, I'm glad your system works for you. Don't get me wrong. It's a terrible way to live. It does not work.
It's just the alternative, which I will say I have tried. I have tried to do a yearly theme that didn't work either. So it was like, well, I'll go with the I'll go with the embracing the chaos and that's a choice. Yeah. Yeah. I live my life one quarter mile at a time. It's all about family.
Fun fact, I started watching fast and the furious for the first time. That's so unnecessary. I know it was like I did it. Well, I was watching mini soup ice skating with a friend. And so like it was, it was great. I sat and cross stitched and watched them ice skate until they got too cold.
And we left and it was a great birthday present for one of their friends. So that was fun. And the fast and the furious, the first, I don't know, 45 minutes of it. There's an entertaining movie. Although I did watch fast and furious first before I was like, wait a second. This is not the right one.
Because let me tell you the naming conventions. Very difficult. Very difficult and confusing. If you have no idea what's going on. Yes, yes. Yeah. So, so really quick, I know you have been someone who is very into the yearly theme.
And we were talking about this at during the pre show that you are, or that I like to do this like reflecting on the end of the year. Can I ask you how you did with keeping up with your theme this year? Yeah. So 2023 was the year of balance.
And it was concentrating on like my ability to balance my body, to balance my diet, to balance my business, to balance my finances, to balance my friendships, and to balance my home. I am going to say it's a success because I worked on all of that. And it was like a present thought in my mind.
Obviously, none of it is, you know, it's perfect. And I think that's the reason that I enjoy the thing, the yearly theme is that there's no true end point. Like you're not like, okay, I did this. I can check it off.
Whereas, you know, if you're goal of the, you know, your New Year's resolution is to lose 10 pounds, which is a terrible idea or a goal or whatever, like you can just check it off.
So now what? Whereas, like by having a yearly theme, it's just kind of a reminder of what you're doing and what to kind of concentrate on.
And so obviously it was not perfect, but it was nice to be able to have just a sentence, the year of balance to kind of, okay, if I'm feeling lost, if I'm feeling crushed, if I'm feeling down or whatever, this is what I want to concentrate on. And Ramon has a really good reminder too.
It doesn't have to be a whole year. It can be, you know, quarters, it can be a month, you know, it's kind of like the conduits that we do, the connections, you know, little micro concentrations, maybe not that much. But basically just like, oh, yes, sorry, seasonal, not quarterly.
Forgive me for using the wrong terminology. But basically it's just kind of an idea of how to easily keep on track with goals without having specific goals, if that makes sense. Yeah. And I think it makes sense. I don't know.
This year, you know, I wax poetic about it at the beginning and I'm like, like I moved across the country. I like didn't travel nearly as much, but I started an international community and like all these other things. I don't even know what that year would be.
It would be the year of like getting off my button doing stuff, which was like the year before where I got off my button did stuff. Right. Right. I don't know. I feel like it's, to me, a lot of this goes into that realm of like sleep tracking.
Like I think some of it is good, but to like what effect? And I opened up one of my favorite apps and I believe they were a previous sponsor. I know they've sponsored some of the other shows on relay.
But timing, big fan of timing, we've talked about in previous episodes, like I think a couple of episodes ago, even. And I looked at like for the year and the only detail that I got out of it was I spent almost as much time watching YouTube videos than I did on all other web traffic. Yeah.
And I mean that that can be helpful in being like, is this, are you happy with that? Is that do you think, do you feel like you're watching too much YouTube and you want to make an adjustment? That's that's kind of like, why are you tracking? What's why are you looking at the stuff?
So I track my sleep with auto sleep.
And I look at that not as a, oh, this is how good or bad I'm doing with sleep or whatever. But more of, okay, I'm feeling really tired. Why is that? And I'm like, oh, because I only got 20 minutes of deep sleep. That makes sense.
What can I maybe do to just like not necessarily, it's not going to change my situation, but it is going to make it like help me give myself a little bit of permission to be tired, I guess, if that makes sense. Yeah.
 And so kind of like along the same lines, having a yearly theme allows me to almost give myself permission to make choices that might be scary or make choices that I might, like, I need a little bit of motivation to be able to make, to make the changes to my life to help me be a happier, better, yes, more productive, but like, I want to be the best version of myself.
And, and that's why the whole idea of yearly themes really helps.
But also I need, I have to, in order to remind myself of it, I need to make sure that like, it's prominent so I don't forget it if that makes sense because my ADHD brain ignores the like existence of things if it's not constantly in my face. Oh, 100% yeah.
So what does it look like for next year? Yeah, so my 2024 yearly theme is the Year of Joy. I am going to be spending time with people that bring me joy and choosing to not spend time with people that don't. Well, it's been a good show everyone.
I am going to be working with people and clients and projects that bring me joy, not necessarily, oh, this is something that brings me the most money or whatnot, but I want to enjoy the people that I'm working with and feel like I'm bringing them forward in ways that give me joy about.
I am going to be okay with the hard things and try and work on acknowledging joy in the midst of those hard things, but not have a level of toxic positivity because that, that's really hard to like, if you're not aware of toxic positivity, it can be really toxic and positive and positive.
So like being okay with acknowledging the fact that something can have some joy in it without it being a good situation, if that makes sense. I want to remind myself daily of what brings me joy.
So I want to do a little bit more solid gratitude and like reminders of this is what the day was, like how what brought me joy today type of a thing. I want to find some creative outlets that bring me joy. I might get back into making TikToks. What? I know, I know, weird.
But like something, something creative that brings me some joy and not just my cross stitch. And then I also, I want to make sure that I'm sharing these joyful moments. It's not bragging if a good thing happens. It's not bragging asking to be seen. It's a good thing.
It's okay to be joyful and to share those moments. Speaking of TikToks, there's a TikTok that I'm going to post in the show notes and I'm posting it in the livestream chat as well that I received that hit my algorithm last summer. And literally the next day is when I was invited to Prague.
And it's this idea of being seen and that it's okay to be seen by whatever public, but in the world, etc. And it's okay to be scared and nervous about that, but it's also good to be proud of what you're doing and where you're at and what's going on.
And so it's a TikTok that's constantly in my repertoire. I have it in a text expander snippet because I need to be reminded of it sometimes. And so that's kind of where my theme is at. It's not like 100% solid.
I need to, you know, I get to make some printables to put up on the wall so that I can be reminded visually of what's going on. But yeah, I'm looking for some more joy in my life. And it's been a good year. It's been a rough year. It's been an interesting year.
And I'm ready to kind of keep track of the joy in the year.
 And so I might need reminders from you amazing conductors to remember the joy, remember the good things, keep track of those and not just let it exist and then move on because I have a really hard time sometimes giving myself permission to be like reminded of the good things that happened and to find that joy.
Yeah. Can I? Yes. No. No. No. Yes. Please, please do. I want to throw out what sounds like a contradicting opinion but is in support of what you're saying. Okay. Remember in the like seeking joy that in seeking it and seeking the like, hey, you're valid. You already are.
And a lot of the joy that you bring to others.
I think there's something to say about like finding joy in that like you're so you're such a positive force like in this community, but also period like there's there's never a moment where I get on a call with Kathy and I worry about whether or not I'm going to feel better.
You know, just there, there have been times where I've called Kathy as like Kathy, I need you to like yell at me. Kathy's like, I refuse to do so. But I will give you the stern talking to that you need. I know that I'm not the only person on this planet that feels that way. Yeah.
Lord, there's enough heartbeat in your house to prove that already. But like I said, all that to say is I want you to receive the joy that you were searching for. But I also want you to realize that you provide so much of that joy to so many people.
So that I would I would hate for that not to weigh in on the joy that you bring to yourself. Thank you for that. I think that that's another part of it is to acknowledge what I bring to others and be be okay asking for that. So I don't know if like I don't know what that looks like.
But to be okay with that, hey, I'm having a bad day. Tell me something good about me type of a situation.
So not necessarily external validation because I don't I am addicted to external validation, especially in my business, words of affirmation is my love language when it comes to like the business that I do and the work that I do.
And I don't necessarily want to to be all, hey, tell me why I'm awesome. But also I think I need to be more okay with getting good feedback or like, hey, tell me what you love about me, which is weird.
But again, that kind of hits that last that last bit of like these these joyful moments and it's not bragging. It's not selfish to ask for support. It's not. It's not a bad thing to have friends and people that are willing to support you in in ways that you might need.
So maybe I'll come up with like an emoji that if I post it somewhere. So people are like, okay, here's why we love you. But that would be weird. So maybe not that. But I'll figure something out. I'll figure something out.
But yeah, I need I know I know that I bring joy to others and that makes me so happy to be able to do. I just forget about it sometimes. I need to make sure that I do my best to be reminded of that. Yeah.
And I do think that there is 100% this this realm of I need to be reminded how much of a boss I am. And again, Kathy, you are one of the people that does that without prompting on a regular basis, which is so amazing.
So maybe that's that's impetus for me to return the favor and just remind you how much of a boss you are because it is it is truly.
I don't want to say that it's hard, but I feel like that because we open ourselves up to people that are not within our not even within our like social media bubble within like our extended bubble like our our bubbles are significantly larger. And it's not because of followers.
And I've been trying to think of a way to like wedge this in is I listen to a listen to a podcast. One of many and one of the hosts mentioned the idea of the problem with social media is that it amplifies what you're looking for.
And sometimes we we are looking for one particular thing and we don't even realize that we're looking for it. And for a lot of folks, that's like validation.
So like sure we're looking for this validation, but for us, it's like trying to drink water from a fire hose because hey, Kathy does like 15 podcasts that are all great and is like a super awesome like business owner.
So there is like so much validation that's already there that it becomes harder to see it because we're not seeing it as much in the places where we go look for it, I guess. Yeah. And I think to the the normal that you live in can be numbing almost.
So every so often like when I'm meeting someone new and you know the whole what do you do? It's like well, it's a great question. Here we go again. Here we go. And kind of like just trying to talk about things that I do.
 And you know, I have so many different segments of my life that certain parts of it are more important than others necessary and it can be difficult because all of all of them bring me joy, all of the different areas, you know, my Wheel of Time world, my photography world, my dance mom world, my podcasting world, my unicorn world, like all of these pieces are so joyful that I don't want to I can't get rid of any of them because I don't like a small part of me would probably like fall off and die if I didn't do part of it.
And so figuring out that the bits of joy and and being reminded of why I do certain things and it's kind of mind blowing still that parts of this life exist and what I'm what I'm doing. That it I need to be more reminded. I need to remind myself more often that I am worthy. I am amazing.
I'm a freaking amazing unicorn. Yeah, you're in that it's okay to talk about. It's not selfish. So yeah. Yeah. So how do you plan on keeping and you mentioned the emoji, the some type of reaction that is a bat signal for all of us to shower Kathy and positivity and encouragement.
But how are you and this is a maybe a question for other folks that are doing theme style things. How are you tracking that and I'm sorry if I if I took over this internet to an interview. No, this is good. This is this is this is good. I'm not quite sure what that looks like.
I have my bullet journal that has been artistically creative and has been really nice and I have some kind of trackers in there. I need to tweak and make adjustments because obviously like some things don't work and other things work or not the way that it needs to, etc.
And so I want to I want to have some sort of tracker like that to be like, Hey, did you do gratitude for the day? Did you, you know, did you schedule something to hang out with other people? Did you, you know, what what is what are each of these individual pieces.
And over the next week, I'm hoping to really drill down like the specifics of what the year of joy means so that I can maybe track it a little bit. But the answer is I'm not 100% sure.
And that's also my answer to Ramon's question in the chat, which is what brings you joy that doesn't involve others. I don't know because I am the way that my brain works. Like I. I don't know. I don't even know what that looks like.
I don't know what that sounds like I don't, I'm not sure because so and part of this is definitely a yeah, I definitely should add that to my theme.
Part of part of that has to do with, you know, the years of caregiving trauma in my life that like I'm fairly built into supporting others and like finding external things. But yeah, I don't know.
So I'm open to suggestions or ways to try and figure out what that answer is because yeah, I don't actually know what that is. I don't know either. Like I can't I can't answer that question. Right. Right. Playing video games and like.
I think that it's interesting that like the question that that Ramon had like bringing you joy that doesn't involve others. I. I feel like I've been struggling with that as well. And I don't know. For me, it's like almost the opposite of what brings me joy that doesn't alien.
Eight people, but also is like time to yourself or that or that brings people in maybe that is respectable and not not respect like it's like a healthy boundary, I guess.
 But I don't know these these end of year things are always like one one thing that I agree with on the the cortex folks who kind of popularized this idea of of theming is that I don't think it has to do you get at the end of the year is like the worst time because there's already so much anxiety around it.
There's already so much like I don't know if people realize this and it didn't I didn't mean for it to become a mental health session for for either of us, but like the holidays are like the worst time mentally for everyone. It's when you know the the largest amount of harm happens.
You're missing people that aren't with us anymore.
You're thinking about the opportunities that you know, you know, some folks even had it in their connections of like I you know, I'm supposed to be connecting with these people and I can't because I'm sick and it's like, ah, like, ah, the the sadness, the seasons are a time of infinite sadness.
Um, and yeah, there's a lot of expectations that come into place. Yeah, our hard to meet. And yeah, I agree with that. I think the the big help there is and shout out to someone who's I would call them a day oneer of conduit, um, Ralezy whose connection has been to just stay on the dualingo streak.
And I know that you know, bad timing because the streak got broken. But one day at a time like one little thing, it's it's such a this is why resolutions fail. Like I'm going to lose 20 pounds. Okay, how are you going to do that boss? Yeah.
Like I'm going to go to the gym every single day or every single week. Like why don't you just do yeah, do five squats in the morning. That will like it's it's so much easier to commit to one squat.
It's easier to commit to doing one squat in the morning than it is to getting up and making a bunch of mental decisions to do a thing. And I do think that the themes help with that because you're basically like it's almost like using the tire method.
Um, to be like, okay, I am using this as a measurement tool for what I want to get done. And what I want to do and where I want the year to go, the direction that I want the year to go. But more than anything, I, I just want like I have life themes, maybe.
And that's like, Hey, is my family healthy and happy? Are they happy with me? Are they happy with? Am I happy with me? Am I happy with my family? Am I happy with my friends and my enemies? And yes, I have enemies. It's fine. I, to me like that, that has been where I've been at.
Am I growing in the directions that I want to grow and not growing in the directions that I don't want to grow? And I don't mean that physically because unfortunately, I just can't fight time those food, food just too good.
But well, and in real Z's blog post, he says at its most basic level, it is a north star to guide the year and what I intend to achieve rather than using absolute and specific goals. It's ultimately about the trend line in an area of focus.
I find this a better way to improve myself with a simple focus. And I think that's a good reminder of kind of like what the, the yearly themes are about and for and why to do it to kind of help give that supportive, you know, support that you could use. Yeah.
I just, I just hope that again, I'm, I'm, I'm harping on this because I'm a, I'm a grumbly little grinch that likes to ruin people's fun. But at the end of the day, I want, I want Kathy, of December 2024 to look back at, you know, the rest of the year and go, it was a good year all in all.
And J, you, you were a small part of that that made it slightly better because that, that's, that's how I look at it. I'm definitely going to happen. Well, that, and that, but that's how I look at it was, if I look back at this year, this year has been absolutely phenomenal.
And a big part of what made it phenomenal was having y'all to come to and talk to about stuff, having people give me the encouragement to make boss moves to, to build communities that have impacted people, like already, and like to just believe that I'm able to do it.
And there's no theme that I could have given myself that would have been as effective as all of the amazing people in the relay community and my amazing co-host and my family.
And everyone else that were just like, my, my theme is the people that, you know, wrote on this roller coaster of life with me. So I, the year of roller coasters. No, that sounds terrible. Sounds horrifying. Unless your theme is actually visiting roller coasters. Oh, yeah.
And then the, the year of amusement parks is definitely way more. Nice. Probably more expensive. I love it. I love it. All right. I, I think it's time for our new connections.
Jay, what is your connection for the next fortnight? I've gone, I've, I think I've used this connection before because I think it's a solid one. I'm going to do one less thing. I don't, I don't know what that one thing is. I'm going to do it though. I'm not going to do it.
Whatever that, whatever that thing is. Not doing it. I, I fought this year, the end of this year, my, my boss kindly reminded me that like, Jay, you're doing too much. And I'm, I'm absolutely planning to fix that. I don't know, I don't know what the one less thing is.
I mean, it could be something as simple as like, you know, not sleeping in one day or something. I don't know. Or, or sleeping in one day. I know. Yeah. See, it works, it works both ways on that one. For sure.
But yeah, I'm, I'm going to, I'm going to do some rent like some internal and examination. That feels weird. I'm going to look at things and say, you know what? Maybe I can just not do that thing and be okay with not doing it. I love that.
What about you? I am going to make the appointments that I need to make. I need to, acres needs a vet appointment, person needs a vet appointment. I need to make three eye doctor appointments for all three of the humans. In the family, I need to reschedule a dentist appointment for many soup.
And I'm sure there are others that I'm forgetting. And so I need to make the appointments that I need to make. Hmm. Now that you've mentioned all the names of your nonhuman animals, it does feel more like a unicorn blessing.
Oh, you have persimmon over there and lip mist paper and the other, the other, the other, you know, fantastic names that exist. But now I think, I think that's great. Yes. What about our conductors? Well, they're not doing anything. They're, they're being the, the laziest I'm kidding.
Our pathologist at the show. Our pathologist at the show, Laura says, enjoy my vacation. See, I told you not doing anything. And when I come back, try for a slow, a sherry entry into life and work and try my best to keep some of the calm I'm enjoying right now going.

And I'll be bringing my family with me and I think we are planning to go to Scotland. So Laura, I need, I need all the, all the stuff, all the, all the places to go check out. But yeah, as long as nothing happens.
Speaking of Scotland, our Scottish panda of the show James has an, his next connection is to test negative, get out of quarantine, hug all humans and have a delayed Christmas dinner. I am excited for my hug if you're hugging all of the humans. So, so bring it on.
Let me know when you get to Atlanta. I will have a hug waiting for you. Our fish bear of the show, Fishy Kai says, release the children. Back into the wild. That didn't make it better either. Oh, school. Yes, yes. Send the kids back to school.
Yes, and help us move out of the, and help smooth out the transition from vacation. I was, I was hoping like release the children and I was like, we'll just end it there and let people think what they do. Release them back into the wild. I love that.
Code Monkey of the show Douglas says new connection, get some Spanish under my belt before vacation and a Spanish speaking country next month and get back on track now that I'm back to 100%. Ho Ray for being healthy and good luck. And if I knew Spanish, I would say good luck in Spanish.
So here we go. Good luck in Spanish. Mm. True words not been spoken. Our identical twin of the show, Aaron says, want to get the next enemy type in my play date game implemented over the next conduit.
Maybe it should just be a tire, a giant tire, just just make it a giant tire or a train or an evil conductor. Mm. I don't know. I'm just going to use my DSL you you do what you want with them.
Our Canadian trivia card enthusiast of the show Erica says next connection organized at least one shelf or drawer. Take two. You can do it. Our shark of the show one pair of shoes says clean my office before we have guests come after the first of the year.
I also want to make it as easy as possible to set up the standing desk I have on order. Oh, man, everybody's going to standing desk. I want to stand. Oh, wait, I have a standing desk. I was like, wait a second. I thought you had one. Our trained enthusiast of the show, Real Z says keep going.

Our procrastinator of the show Emma says I am really and truly going to do the same connection. I've been planning for ages. I will sort through at least one of the big bag of clothes from my pile. Oh, doom. Oh, a pile of doom. Because I need to reclaim the space in both my flat and my mind.
