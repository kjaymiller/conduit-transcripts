From RelayFM, you're listening to Conduette, the show we Condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduette, the show that always goes above and beyond to let those that work for us and on behalf of us know that you're doing a good job.
This episode is brought to you by our lovely superconductors. I am Jay and with me is the person that you can always know will give you a smile. Never mind, I can't finish that sentence because I was going to go a weird direction. It's got the cable. Hey, Kathy. Hi, Jay.
Seems like we're going to be in a weird place today. Would you know what? It's one of my favorite favorite vibes, shall we say? Even if you're a terrible person. That's fine.
So the illusion to terrible patterns of behavior from all people being mentioned, Kathy is getting ready for an amazingly fun and awesome trip across the globe. Also, we didn't talk about this in the pre show. I just got back from like a week long trip that was a lot. But no worries there.
It was all good. I didn't need to provide gifts for anyone other than my family. Never tell you anything. If you want to know what we're talking about, I'm a superconductor.com. But in the post show, another secret that I know about Kathy is that Kathy has this inability to keep things alive.
So we're going to be doing a tier list of cheepets, the easiest thing on the planet to keep alive. Okay. So again, if any of that sounds fun, then you might want to hang out with this.
But also what happened in the discord this week, Kathy? Yeah, we are getting closer and closer to the relay 10 anniversary show in London that's happening in July. And that means it's now time for the merch release. We've got a couple shirt designs. There is a challenge coin.
And for a very limited period of time, there was a group of about 30 mark one relay FM branded pens that were put up on cotton bureau. They are already sold out because all of the members in the discord got access to it very first, which is a benefit of membership that I highly recommend.
It is also a membership special season. So if you stay tuned to your crossover feed, if you are a member of any show, not just us, but ours is the best for sure.
If you are a member and you are subscribed to the crossover feed, you will see a variety of presents that will arrive in your feed to come, including upcoming in June will be a very special game. That Alex Cox presented to myself, Jay and to our friend, Julie Scott.
So stay tuned for that if you are a member and if you are not a member, visit I am a superconductor.com. Yes, the return of make Robo do is always a pleasure. I look forward to it every year. It's the third year that we've done this. This is that's amazing. I know.
And then I'll say stop letting me score for some reason. Yeah, because you keep winning magically.
Somehow a week has gone by and we had this amazing thing that we do in our all weeks called our co working chat, which we are superconductor friends hang out outside of the discord walls where we can be as silly as possible. I gave a tour of Toronto where I was.
I also got yelled at as usual for having a very reasonable take on the standards of construction of a Reese's cup. I feel like I did nothing wrong and I was attacked. So you if you want to stand in solidarity with me, just know that I've been I've been attacked a lot today.
And I would I would have. I wonder why. Totally not for reasons. So yeah, you should join us in our co working session where you can defend my honor. And if you want to or do you join the discord or hang out with us in the preer post show, visit I'm a superconductor.
com and become a member today that is letter I letter M letter a superconductor.com. Next we got some shout outs and I have a special shout out to Aidan and Samla for having so much fun with me in Toronto and I I spelled it T O R O in O because there's no second T in there.
That was the one that was one of the biggest things that I learned. Also, we had a great time grabbing dinner and going to a baseball game and really diving into the complexity that is the sport of American baseball. baseball I guess across the world is about the same.
So yeah, just baseball in general. It was I had a blast for those that don't know with my joby job. I go to Toronto once a quarter. So it's good to have some friends up in the in the city and being able to say, hey, I'm in town.
You know, let's have dinner or something or let's make plans and yeah, Aidan and Samla were both so amazing to hang out with. So again, thank you, thank you so much.
Thank you for hanging out with me and having to deal with so much drama that was happening outside of what we were doing because that's the life I lead. It's full of drama. We also had a shout out from Pillix, which Kathy, do you want to take that? Yeah, absolutely.
So in our last episode, we talked about options for what we might be able to present as ideas for podcasts a thon. We're like for what are they called like landmark points of things. Basically, we do streams where we like people will do things.
And last year we played Baldur's Gate where we had some major gale hate, which was worth it. We looked at ideas, we're trying to figure out ideas for maybe another multiplayer game to play. So Pillix has a whole list of ideas.
So the we are here series says these that I'm really, really like interested in. There's one that isn't on the list and I feel like it should be on the list, just given our amazing dynamic. But I might get a finish the Pillix. There's only like three that should be mentioned.
Well, I'm going to mention them all because I appreciate the time effort and energy that Pillix put into it. Pillix must be going across country. Wow, you know what, that's it. I'm I'm done. Peace out. Bye. So bread and bread, death squared, EWA, EWEE, which is a game that I have. We've played.
I really enjoyed moving out overcooked one and two, Peackelpark and unrailed. Okay, so I was just going to throw out there that overcooked one and two and unrailed are on my wish list already for steam. So I would vote for one of those. The one that's missing that I feel like would be a good game.
I might also get yelled at if we play it on stream would be it takes two. Which is like a game that you have to play with one other person and it's absolutely amazing. I've watched people play it, but I've never played it before. So yeah, that's that's what I was going to say.
I vote for either overcooked one and two one or two and unrailed or it takes two. But again, it takes two. I think is a longer game. So yeah, I think. I'm also looking at the internet and it's only on the switch play stations Xbox or Windows. I have a steam deck. So that should work.
Well, we're in there. Yeah, I should be able to do that. You have a, okay, do you have a gaming console? Yeah, I have a switch. But I don't know how to stream it. Can you set up Kathy? It's fine. We get you a capture card. Ask actually already have a capture card.
Yeah, I still just use the capture card. Yeah, perfect. All right, we'll figure that out. That's that's for future us problems future us problems. Also, I promise I'm going to stop bugging Kathy today. Are you probably not anyway? Yeah, probably not. I think you need to read the comment from Mike.
Next shout out is from Mike. I was getting there. This is Jay. No, blue Disney pandas or apples of, okay. Now listen, listen. It's not that I'm saying no, blueie or Disney.
First of all, those are, I mean, in our house, they're the same thing because if they said no, Disney, it would be no Disney plus, which means a lot of no things, which we do use. Disney plus no Disney classic stories and also no theme parks that keep proliferating the Disney classic stories.
Once you bring Kusco to Disney, either land or world, have him on screen. Like I'm all for it. You know, let's let's do that. Panda's I stand firm in pandas or trash animals. And it's not that Apple stuff.
It's it's big corporation marketing that makes you believe that they're doing the right things for the right reasons when they're really doing the right things because capitalism.
And if you if you really want to know my opinion on that, I raised a lot of money for the right reasons this year and I'll be surprised if we even match close to that next year. And also none of the big corporations that were in the room raise their hands to help out.
So again, they only do the right thing when it's beneficial for them. And that's not just Apple. That's all of them. So big capitalism, not Apple pandas. Yeah, that's true.
And then blue and Disney are just unrealistic stories proliferated to set really high expectations and then ultimately shatter those expectations. Yeah, that's those are my beefs. Speaking of beefs, the fastest way to cook them is with electricity. And this is why it's time for a connection check.
Stop. Okay, so Kathy, what was your connection? My connection was to make a cozy place to finish the project that needs to happen. So I had my little office chair with little table. I put handles. I put a soft blankie and I jammed out to some music, my Spotify and I managed to get the project done.
And we're in the final steps to then present it before the client leaves to on a trip today. And so hopefully in the next couple of weeks, I should have a result, which is very exciting. That is awesome.
I, my connection was to give people the ability to come up with ideas and support them in their abilities to ID8 and execute on them. I did that. I think I did a really good job of that actually. Not only did I push out there like, hey, I can't do this by myself.
Not saying that I am, but saying that I'm doing a lot of this because it's my job to do as much of this until people step up and take the reins. But I did that. Some people did step up and then we had the super awesome event.
 And then more people stepped up and we built like three or four teams that are tackling different things across the community or across the nonprofit now, which is fantastic because I am intentionally not being included on things so that they can have a sense of autonomy and a sense of like you don't need my permission to be awesome.
And it has, it's still, it's still a little stressful because there's just so many other things that I want to get off of my plate.
But it's moving in the right direction and in at least in those things, it feels really, really nice to not be constantly bombarded with like figuring those things out. And then we have our conductors do have our conductors and I just realized that I did not know I just missed one. Okay, okay.
Oh, thank you. Welcome. It's true. That's true. So, artist of the show Carly says, connection check green heart. I grabbed coffee with an old friend from high school who I haven't seen it forever turns out she's a freelance writer and she's going to interview me. So it was a win.
I wasn't expecting that when I invited her. There we go. Our target of the show, she says connection check. I feel all the habit of doing these a while ago. So I don't know how I did it. My last connection. That's okay. We're just happy to have you back to toss. It's true. That's true.
Our soprano of the show Deb O says connection check green heart. I selected and purchased a quilt pattern and got the approval for of the mom to be ordered fabric. So I'm well on my way for the bangstatus of the big belt. I can't wait to see.
Our checklist enthusiasts of the show Mike says previous connection green check mark. I set up my personal weekly review process created a to do a template and went through the first review. Now I just need to do some fine tuning. That's awesome.
And I'm glad that you brought that up during our systems check week. So awesome. All right. So while Kathy is doing Kathy things. I'm getting that figured out I'm just going to burn through this list really quick.
The name list of the show nameless says green square connection check the winter clothes are stored away through the block schedule or though the block schedule did not work with the connection was set up the block schedule. That's okay.
Like didn't work maybe just not your thing or maybe there's some refinement that can happen. Our Oracle of the show so says connection check green apple I haven't finished my article yet but I've worked on it most days.
It's going slowly but it's going I totally get that so I it took me like three weeks to make a survey. In the only way that I can make it was a little by little.
The tech podcast listener the show pillics says connection check green tree I have I have applied for jobs worked on granddad projects started learning flask for the project. Yay. I know what that is also I talked to the person that maintains it so let me know if you have any questions.
They're a good friend of mine and kept up learning Swift UI that's awesome that's you're doing a lot of the dev work and I like it. Our dinner I identical twin of the show errands as connection check green circle running continues to go well looking forward to doing some more this week.
 One of them one of them robotics engineer of the show Aiden says connection check yellow heart this last comment may not have been the best time to try and build a routine with the long weekend and other disruptive days made enough process that I don't feel like I deserve a red but more structure needs to be done.
Perfectly okay with that and you'll get them in the next one our mountain dollar of the show.
I'm not going says yellow circle some family health stuff came up everyone is okay now but I lost a few days of useful time so all I did was study for my certification that is okay you made the best of the time that you had.
Our pathologist of the show Laura says yellow heart my last connection was to just rest more I think I did okay with this possible green heart territory I finished two books and did more sitting and less filling with the time with random tasks than you.
However turns out I'm not actually good at this and ended up feeling fairly anxious on the days that I got the most rest only giving a yellow heart because I need to discuss this with my therapist.
 I mean I think you still earned a green the fact that you recognize the things that were hard and you're you're not only like recognizing it and acknowledging that it's hard but being willing to talk about it I think is super awesome and one thing that I have learned having my own bad habits of being a chronic worker or someone who has to feel like they're always working is it takes a lot of time to reset your brain into being okay with not doing anything.
 And supposedly this is where the whole like kids on their iPads thing like is looking like it may not be a great idea is that kids are going to wind up being anxious because they're constantly used to stimulus and need time to themselves in their own heads unless they don't have internal monologue and then they just need time in the quiet I guess.
Anyway our fish bear the show fishy guy says connection check green circle household admin pal is smaller somehow I had more time this week to catch up that's awesome.
And lastly our Canadian trivia card enthusiast of the show Erica said green check I did my exercise routine exactly once and then I broke my toe. So I'm glad I only aimed for once.
Good job I think please please get better rest rest your your broken toe and yeah good job good job at least getting something knocked out there.
Alright so as we mentioned before this episode doesn't have a product sponsor this week that's just because doing sponsorship stuff is complicated and we actually have multiple sponsors next week because of just how the weeks rolled I guess.
But we wanted to take this time to mention our lovely super conductors and I will just say we have some of the coolest people on the planet you hear some of their stories just through these connections you have people who have gotten married throughout the show people who have changed careers.
We have people who are going into finishing school writing books and for some reason these amazing wonderful people take time out of their day to listen to two friends which I say friends Kathy might want to choke me out from time to time just because I give Kathy a hard time.
But you know these amazing people take time out to listen to us and to commiserate with our stories to hear us regale about how we are productivity enthusiasts who have become somewhat upset with the way that productivity is talked about online.
How it is almost fetish fetishized and not taken as a way to be just super helpful and I would say they do a lot.
But there's a lot of things that I've been able to do in my personal career some leaps that I've made some chances that I've taken and a lot of it was based on the support of our super conductors in some cases just verbally and emotionally and in some cases actually financially so.
 So yeah this was a thank you to our super conductors it is it is you and the rest of the people that listen y'all are the reasons why we do this every other week and we keep showing up but especially those super conductors and I will end it the way we always end it thank you for your support of conduit and all of relay FM.
So Kathy it is a systems check week which we like these systems checks because we feel like they're really good onboarding for new listeners who may have been like wow these people hate each other or at least one person hates the other person.
So for those that are still here what is a systems check. A systems check is where so most of the time our episodes basically come in and we don't talk about specific tools we strongly believe that the tool that works best for you is the best tool to use.
But additionally systems tend to change over time a good system will adjust based on whatever you might have going on in your life in your work in your day and being able to adjust what you do and how you do it in order to make sure that you keep track of everything.
So we like to come in once a quarter and just kind of update what we're doing how we're doing it how we're feeling about our systems like what we might be working on changing or what we have changed and actually talking about the like actual tools that we use to try and be the best that we can.
Yeah it's definitely interesting to see the like waves that we kind of ride when it comes to doing the productivity thing. I think sometimes it is very like I'm in love with my setup everything is great and then it kind of bounces back into everything is horrible and this isn't this is this is bad.
 I am like this is one of those episodes for me so like I feel like the last couple of systems checks have been really rough for me and I think that I mean I don't know I don't know if that's good or bad I don't know if I'm onto something newer if I'm just catching up to the changes that are happening.
 But yeah Kathy let's do you want to start or I feel like you always start with these so I don't mind starting but I will leave it up to you well if you want to start since you started your writing like your notes taking then I can put my notes in and we can do that sure or I don't mind going first I can go.
So this year was the year that I was going to try the Hoanichi I have a Hoanichi Tacho original okay I can never remember which one I have it's right in front of me and I'm the thing that I mentioned that I really liked about the Hoanichi was that there was a page for every day.
And this this is true there is a page for every day it feels very much like I haven't been using my Hoanichi and a part of that is because of my travel schedule originally I didn't expect to be traveling as much as I have been.
Yeah that's that is affecting my mental a lot of the amount of travel that I have like I'm going to be gone almost two weeks in July actually I'm going to be gone for like all of July because I have other things that are non-work related that I'm traveling for.
 And when I travel I tend to not take my Hoanichi with me mostly because I don't know like I'm usually operating out of like a hotel and I'm at a booth doing stuff and I don't really have like when I'm at my desk my Hoanichi sits in between my keyboard because I have a split keyboard so it's left left pad.
 Left pad Hoanichi right pad and then I can just jot down what I'm doing but when I'm in a hotel I'm not taking my keyboard I could I might maybe I should but I'm usually not and that's just because I'm I'm constantly moving around I'm going places and and doing stuff so I don't really feel like I have a good opportunity to just sit down and like do the I am working on this I feel like I'm just.
 Doing you know piece by piece by piece by piece and everything feels chaotic in that time and that's that's the thing where I say it feels like a failure until it doesn't because I mean I tell you today was my first day back at work from a long trip and I filled up the page this morning which is things that I needed to do because I know that I knew that today was going to be hectic and it was like wow if I felt at the end of the day like I got nothing accomplished.
 This book would just be telling me like nah you did a lot like look at all this stuff that you did and that was the purpose of this Hoanichi that being said I am still a little concerned about the amount of like blank pages in the back because there's only like six pages and I have so many things that I'm going to do.
 I have so many big projects that I'm working on right now that feel they're not connected they're super disjointed like there's there's so many some of its work some of its nonprofit stuff some of its you know we just got our floors replaced and there's still more things that they got to do there so I'm having to keep track of all that stuff and like six pages is not enough and this is where what I what I really want is like a Hoanichi like half book like I want the five year Hoanichi but I also just wanted to have one year in the recipe blank pages so that I could just fill out like all of those pages with stuff which has me if I'm sorry if only there was a way to have a notebook with blank pages.
 Yeah yeah yeah so this is this is the challenge is that yes me and my notebook from last year my plotter that I had like it was all blank pages but that didn't give me my page a day already lined up so all I had to do is start writing and again when I talk about the friction that comes with just adding the date to the page or adding a little design to the top like yes for me.
Yes for some people that is an opportunity to make the day yours from the start for me it's just one more thing that I got to remember to do and that I've got no no no no I think you're misunderstanding I think you're misunderstanding I'm saying using both.
Oh that's option two notes so yes one that is your notebook for blank pages that is the planning that note taking the full like everything involved here and then the other is your date today one that's already has the stuff in it.
And you could always so yes I totally get another option is because you have blank pages is utilizing those blank pages and pretending that they're blank pages.
 Like that that even though they're so they're empty and just using that as your notes yeah but that becomes a little bit more difficult to keep track of in the chat rosemary mentioned the file effects which I used file effects for a very long time and I do I really enjoy those pages as well the rings were a little bit.
Unfortunate for me and so I I fell off of that even though I have a variety of very very nice ones to do but having having something that like seeing if you can mentally have to separate.
Books one for the the planning one for like the actual project based see if that could work yeah I so I am what I've kind of resigned myself to is I will probably either a go back to the plotter after this year.
 And kind of do that like that's basically what I had with the plotter was I had like two notebooks one is like a cat like a annual spread and the other was just a blank notebook and you know the plotter was kind of more design that you ripped the pages out but I could just keep the entire notebook in there.
 I think that kind of does similar to what the file effects is doing also I haven't checked in on plotter and a while because I wanted to give myself the best chance of being successful with the whole of an easy and I know the second I go on to the website they've got yep they've got new stuff and it looks.
 Of course they do so yeah there's there's a lot of there's a lot of like I don't know what's there and that's probably for a good reason because if I did it would try to it would be it would urge to like immediately start going well I could get these refills and I could do this other refills and then I can do like this this and this and now I'm just like this is this was a mistake.
 But also I do remember the diary refills for the plotter I did not like because they're basically a calendar or they're the like Hobanichi weeks style where it's just like a strip and you have to try to fit everything in that little bit of strip which is not my thing I need like again I need a daily page.
I don't know why I need a daily page but a daily page is what I need.
Okay so question for that and you can say you know whatever have you tried not using a daily and is it just like you're not able to know like you're not able to actually do it like it doesn't work for your brain or do you just think that that's what you're doing. That that's what you need to do.
 I think the daily pages are good for my brain in that when I'm again I get into these moments where I feel like I haven't done anything and like the reality is I know that I'm doing a lot all the time but I think that there's a there's that weird like if you're doing a bunch of little tasks of no substance that don't really feel like they're going to anywhere you don't really feel like they're going to do it.
Anywhere you don't really feel like you're doing anything you're just like spinning your wheels.
 Having having them written down on like okay what did you do last week and I could look at last week and go okay these five things that you did this this this this and this these all go towards this bigger goal and it wasn't that you were working on the bigger goal it was like okay this day you did a little bit kind of like I think it was maybe it wasn't Laura it was someone else's connection and they're going to do it.
 I think it was a good connection and they were talking about like accomplishing it like little by little and like me talking about I worked on the survey for our for our organization and it took me three weeks to do the survey or to make the survey and the way that I did it was basically I like on the bus from the airport to the hotel like I worked on the survey a little bit as I was sitting at the booth waiting for people to come by I was working on the survey a little bit on my flight.
 I was working on the server like it was like I was finding these little pieces of time and if I don't have the day that that happened it's like oh I worked on the survey and it was like okay well I've already written that I worked on the survey so I don't need to like write it down again or if I wrote if I wrote I worked on the survey 50 times it's like wow I spent a lot of time working on the survey but like having it like plotted in between like I'm not going to be able to do it.
I was working on the survey and like flight to Pittsburgh bus ride to hotel like worked on thing like oh yeah that's right I did work on this while I was doing that thing.
It's just like it serves a purpose of giving me like this little like good job you found some time and did the thing during that time remember you also were doing these 17 other things that are probably important.
So I think I totally get that is it something that you could have that smaller space of a weekly spread to fill in that information or does it need to be a full page I think it needs to be a full page because some days it feels like a full page isn't even enough. Okay, yeah got it.
 And the last thing in that of of all of this was I've kind of settled on using to do this for a little while not not to do the daily page stuff like I'm still using when I'm here doing my my daily pages in my hope and eG but like there's a lot of things that I'm responsible for I shouldn't even say doing that have multi steps.
And I need a space to collect all of that and again like I have six projects currently into do is that are active which would take all six pages of my my hope and eG and I have thought about the like what about two notebooks I actually do I have the.
The sidekick not pad not the psychic not pad the sidekick not pad and I often do like write out steps on those things of kind of like hey here's this thing that i'm working on throughout the week that is like multiple steps all right those steps out on there.
I genuinely do not want to carry two notebooks around i'm kind of I did that before the there was a comment in the chat that has me looking at the meddori travelers notebooks again I have a travelers notebook cover so like yeah I could easily go back to a travelers notebook.
I mean I don't know it's for right now i'm just paying for to do this monthly until I feel like I have a better grasp on things or at least the amount of projects that i'm working on is less and I do feel like that's going to happen not necessarily soonish but I I do think that.
Things will start to slow down in certain areas and speed up and pick up in other areas and there are other tools that are responsible for keeping all of that stuff under control and those tools are often people.
Because they'll be like hey Jay you're working on this do you have an update and I'll go yeah I was doing this this in this here's where I am and that's good enough but for the things where I don't have a project manager or someone to help me.
Keep track of where I am to do is has been super helpful and I don't know I think we've talked about it before I've been a long term on and off to do this person I don't have I switched between them just whichever one is working at the moment for me to do is seems to be fine like I.
I the one thing that these are always not meant to be is like an invitation to be like you should try doing this and then just moving everything in there because it's going to change your life it's like we know we we know yeah so yeah right now right now to do is to serving as that other notebook.
 And also just a shout out I finally caved and I got drafts on my work computer I didn't pay for another annual membership for those that don't know we have to keep separate accounts for work and for like our personal lives so and I cloud drive is not allowed so what I basically had to do was get drafts on my computer have it not back up to I cloud drive and then basically just have it be drafts like the bare bones version of drafts and it's been so helpful like I can't even I can't even begin to like yes it sucks because now I have like certain like things that I've written that are on a different computer and not on like my personal computer which thinks to my phone and all these other things but like it has been so helpful for like I just need to write something down really quick and or I just need to think about what I'm writing as I'm writing it and I'm always paranoid that I'm going to hit send early so yes drafts it's where tech starts for me at least.
 So glad that I'm using it again for work stuff and I am very I'm considering very much why don't I just have work pay for it or at least ask them to pay for it I think the answer is like they don't they pay for things but they don't always pay for personal decisions when there's like another tool that they're like you could just use Google docs and we have that and you could just use that instead.
 That would be their justification for not paying for it which again yeah but here's here's the thing you won't know until you ask yeah yeah yeah yeah because until you ask the answer is no yeah you're not wrong you're not wrong I know so that's me that's that's where I met Kathy where you've been what you doing.
 Oh alright so my my system is very similar to what it's been in the past I am using a bullet journal system in my notebook therapy notebook and doing weekly spreads on there with the monthly artistic like let me take a moment at the beginning of the month just kind of vibe with my notebook shall we say.
And then I've started using my Luchstrom 1917 as meeting notes I am possibly so just like my connection was potentially large big time project that will require a variety of extra stuff I need to be taking those notes now.
 The thing with this is I want to have it handwritten but instead of making the notes in my iPad like I do for a variety of other clients not everything that I take notes of needs to be kept it's not all actionable it's not all like important information and so my thought process is if I have my notes handwritten in a separate notebook then I'm going to have a note.
 After the meeting because I have to send an email with like here's the things we talked about an actionable items and like just a you know a higher level this is what's going on type of a thing if I handwritten in the book and I can then use that as a way to like review it and be like okay this is what actually needs to happen.
 And then I can move it over into omnifocus and into the follow up meeting and that sort of thing so that is my plan is right now for this project omnifocus is still working really really great especially when I actually use it that's been my problem is that I haven't been using it like I know I need to like when I sit in the morning and I spend five 10 minutes just like reviewing what needs to happen for the day and putting those things into omnifocus it's amazing how those things actually get done because I'm not trying to rely on my brain to remember what needs to happen.
So this is my friendly reminder to myself and to anyone else that needs to hear this or as they say on the social media is I don't know who needs to hear this but. If you use your tools and the system that you have in place it has a higher possibility to work.
I know that's a hot take you're welcome.
 And then I also my little note here I decided that I was going to put Spotify premium on my list of things because it has been really really like important in my brain to come in and and say like to listen to music more often tens of I tend to like watch things but lately I've been like bouncing all around and so I've just been playing a variety of music.
Usually it's whatever my day list on Spotify is which has some interesting interesting titles for things like right now my day list let me look.
Day list is modern folk cottage core Tuesday morning you listen to meditation and focus on Tuesday mornings here's a modern folk cottage core acoustic mountain granola vibes and rainy day.
 Music so that is what we're playing when I'm we finish this recording and it is really nice to not have to think about what I want to listen to and usually it's it's pretty good and give me the right vibes although yesterday morning did a lot of country and not like Beyonce country but like country country and I was like I'm going to pass I'm going to pass on that it did not flow.
With my brain so that I think I'm going to need to be making some tweaks in the future though we'll see how this works because that's the thing is that. I don't know how it's going to work until I'm actively needing to be in it and so.
Over the next couple weeks especially because so next week I'll be in Taiwan a week.
And I still need there are still things that need to happen that need to get done so I'm going to be taking a like a shortened version of my stuff so I think i'm just going to be using my iPad and like making notes on it or whatever not necessarily my physical notebooks but I might.
Maybe I'll just take like field notes and that'll be like smaller pages because I definitely work better if I can hand right so if I take field notes it will fit in my like travel wallet and we'll sit like and be easy to.
Just I don't know well we'll we'll see I have a three days and eight hours to figure that out so we'll see how that goes there was there was something that you mentioned. With your you're kind of like meeting notebook i love the idea of sitting with your notes.
Again that my my psychic no pad is that that notebook for me as well i don't think i well we haven't had a systems check since i started like sketch noting like. Not not the not like greatly like ugly sketch notes.
No judgment there's not a like a reward you're not making a business with this yeah i think the. The biggest help for me in it has been. Just keeping my keeping one part of my brain occupied so that i guess the other brain the other side of the brain would listen. And pay attention and even like.
If I looked if I thought about like the last thing i put in a daily log that wasn't today which is like right out in front of me i would struggle to think about what happened in that like particular day or like like a good example of this was. um.
Checked out went to office okay i don't even know what that means checked out went off i genuinely don't like i'm reading this and i have no idea what this means. But i can tell you about a drawing that i did. When i was in spain for like one of our meetings that was.
Is super totally interesting he said while shaking his head vigorously in one direction that you may not expect. Um wait. TM but. The like being able to recall stuff in that meeting is it's not by. The words that were said it's by like the goofy pictures that i was drawing of like of like uh Mr.
Crabbs from Spongebob going i love AI i mean money i mean AI. So like there are there are definitely these moments where like. I don't know how that plays a role but what i do know is like i i just start sketch noting in my my sidekick notepad um or my plotter desk.
Pat i just kind of grab whichever one i grab and then i use it because ultimately it's not important like. I don't even keep the drawings i just draw them in them when i'm done i'm like.
All right any action items okay cool right those in my notebook and then like the drawings themselves can be thrown away. Um it's just funny that like in those moments i'm i'm able to more clearly recall the information that was given.
Based on these drawings but yeah something about i don't i don't know if it's just the tangibility of of using physical paper versus like just typing things in. Um or if it's the like specific i'm doing a thing different because it's engaging a different part of my brain. Um that's helping yeah.
Like have a better focus as well as a better. Uh recollection of what's happening in those meetings. Yeah it's entirely possible it's hard to say though like why brains do what they do but man i'm glad that they are doing what they're doing. They don't. Oh wow. Well i think. Cool.
Anything you you mentioned wanting to change some things up um any specifics into that or still not sure yet. Yeah i'm still not sure yet i just know that i need to i need to be a joll. Ugh.
So i know so gross so gross but i know there are there are things that are probably going to be happening in the future. Um and so i need to be ready to make the changes that i need to make even if i don't right now know what they are. Yeah.
 There there is a topic that i we don't have time to get into it today but i want people to remind me that this is a topic um it kind of goes in the realm of Laura's connection um around needing needing time in the quiet needing needing like time where we're not doing anything and battling the anxiety around that um i am feeling that my system isn't failing me that my behavior is setting me up for issues that i don't think any system would fix that i don't think i don't think that it's a like i need to use this this and this and then i'm good or inbox zero or gtd or blah blah blah um agile um i don't think any of those things are the answer i think the answer truly is a part of my job that i need to be okay with is the act of not doing and the act of saying like today's going to be an admin day like i'm going to do all of the admin things that i needed to do so that i can spend the rest of the day focusing on or the rest of the week focusing on other things and the only way that stuff is going to get done is if i choose to feel like i'm unproductive today by doing the admin stuff or doing the quote unquote not important stuff or the stuff that i get paid to do like today has been nothing but receipts and like doing trip stuff like getting reimbursed for all my trip stuff and then scheduling my next trips um so like looking at it i'm like nothing got done today even though again no book tells me it did but i think i just have to be okay with saying a part of your job is to do this so make it a day either one day a week or one day just as it's needed to be like i'm only focusing on doing these things because if i don't then they're going to get in the way of doing other things in the future yes oh my goodness i think that's something that i need to remind myself that yes taking that time for admin is important and we'll set you up for success um when i do my morning routine i feel better i have not journaled or done even some any semblance of my ideal like morning routine in months um and i know that it's part of why i'm feeling like out of control a little bit um and so i definitely need to get back into it because i do feel so much better when i sit down and kind of plot instead of just getting right into things i feel better and i know i feel better so why don't i do it because brains yeah brains yeah and i'm sure that they're brains i'm totally sure that again i think this is a topic that we want to say for the next episode because we we need to give ourselves time to really develop on that but cathy speaking of developing on new things what you're going to do this this connection other than enjoying traveling around the world being being a a trend setter influencer in the tech space i am going to take my mornings to like i'm going to do my morning routine i'm going to do at least some piece of my morning routine including when i'm on vacation because it's not a vacation it's a workcation so what i'm going to do so i think i'm i am going to take out a notebook of some sort i don't know which one maybe i'll grab a new one which always makes it more fun oh maybe i'll buy one in taiwan and that'll be like my brain dumps left okay um rose we're going to uh the stationary store well we already have a list like that's one of the links um that is on a list to to check out so that's definitely going to be um one of my things uh but um i want to like even journaling like i want to write what we did the day before because my memory isn't super great so like if i write down what happened i know it's going to i'm gonna have a better chance of remembering the trip um and and just having a good a good time and and effort and energy to be able to do that so i'm going to at least journal um every day i like it um in in the other world of j being constantly confronted with deadlines um i am going to try to blow the dust off of live streaming um something that i haven't done in a long time and it's it's purely just been because trying to understand my role at work um and what that looks like but i have a talk coming up that i need to be prepared for and i'm trying to be super super ambitious about it and a part of that is working on this application and i need to build the application so um um whenever i live stream it gives me the ability to like actually go and do things and also it you know there are people who are learning python or who are learning a different tool one of the tools that i'm using and i feel like i can be it can be a good opportunity to catch up with them to show them things that i'm learning so that they don't have to make the same mistakes um but also it it gives me an excuse to sit in the chair especially like right now my daughter is out of school so there's like this urge to constantly be like well what's what are they doing?
 let me go in and you know see what's happening there bother them yeah so so now it's like no nope your at work got to focus got to do the work thing yeah and if the camera is on and pointing at me then i'm gonna be more likely to sit at my desk and do the work so i'm gonna i'm gonna commit to at least doing it twice in the next um conduit good i love that well i'm typing it now okay so now for our conductors our artists at the show Carly's new connection it's going to keep trying to grab coffee with people it worked so well last time that i want to do it again with someone new love that i'm so excited for you i can't wait to hear our entire advocate of the show chintas says finish the cape is it the is it the conduit cape is it a conduit cape i see oh the i've been sewing i know i've got a busy couple of months coming and i want to make sure it's ready in plenty of time for a certain extravaganza is the conduit cape it is okay i'm so excited oh that's awesome amazing art is the prano of the show debos says next connection get pieces cut out for the baby quilt one of my mom's favorite parts is cutting pieces when she makes quilts our checklist enthusiasts of the show mike says start setting up website and other infrastructure for new project already bought the domain new projects everybody loves a good new project yeah our nameless of the show nameless says new connection find new boxes for the winter clothes the cardboard boxes have been a good tool but they are falling apart time to get something more long lasting also install the garden wire in the cart in the crawl space i think those sound like great things to do our oracle of the show sof says i've been procrastinating on applying for my Irish passport for about a year and now i've lost some documents i need for it i'm going to try really hard to find them and order copies if i can't then actually do the thing and apply yes so um we need you to have your passport so that you can come visit us in london um so please do the well so it's already already a british citizen and has british i'm so confused on how that works and but then how would they get and so i think it's how they get i think it's a second passport what what i'm so confused why would you need a Irish passport i think that uh sof's eligible for dual citizenship citizenship and so maybe i could be wrong though i could be completely wrong um so sof let us know how wrong we are and also good luck in getting all the passport stuff done yes yes for sure um our tech podcast listener of the show pylix says next connection same thing learn swift ui keep working on flask and project and keep applying wait oh keep applying for the jobs there you know there was a little clapping hands in the in the tennics so your one our identical twin of the show Aaron says i want to wrap up the bulk of my freelancing project in this conduit i have a major feature to finish implementing and then address some technical debt um i've yeah yeah yeah you you got this um best of luck and pushing pushing this to be before the deadline i'm guessing um but you got this yes our robotics engineer of the show edan says new connections start collecting my various projects into portfolio that i can send in along with my job applications also figure out what an engineering portfolio is supposed to look like and then upside down in the smiley face uh yeah good luck with that i have no um suggestions uh so i hope uh it all works out yeah our mountain dollar of the show loading says um round two fight no round two workout no um round two set up the businessy stuff and several practice tests for the certification maybe the real maybe the real one if those go well i think you got this little gang you're doing great new con do it our pathologist of the show Laura new connection catch up i've been in do the minimum at work mode because the minimum has been a lot the past few weeks i want to catch my breath a bit and catch up with some longer term projects during the next two weeks i think that sounds absolutely fantastic and then our fish bear the show fishie guy says new connection we have some long overdue home improvement projects that we'd like to get done this year this kind of it i'll focus on prepping those or prepping for those which comes with cleaning organizing and throwing stuff out etc excellent our last connection for this fortnight comes from the canadian trivia card enthusiast at the show erica who says next connection stay off my broken toe as much as possible i think that sounds like a really smart idea if you would like to submit a connection you can do so in the relay discord in the hashtag show follow up channel by starting your message with the conduit emoji and putting your connection after you can also submit it by feedback when you click on the link in the show notes or using the submit feedback button at relay.
