From Relay FM, you're listening to Conduit, the show where we condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that will supervise you in learning. This episode is brought to you by Peaca and Jelly. I'm Kathy and with me today is someone who is always learning.
Jay. That that that one is accurate. I am always learning. I love to learn. I know. See, what did you think? I was not like excuse me, everything I say is always accurate. I mean, okay. What? Probably safe, probably safe. Oh, how you doing? I'm good. We'll get into it.
But I've been doing a lot the last week for those that don't know. I just got promoted at work. So I'm now a people manager. But I've also got to do like strategic planning and I'm learning how to do all of that. At the same time, we had a giant hole in our ceiling that I had to get repaired.
And yeah, there's that. And then on top of that, we were like, you know what? That was a great time to also remodel our bathroom. So. Yep. Yep, that sounds about right. That's the right. So it's been it's been a busy, busy week. Lots of trips to Home Depot. But yeah, how about you? Yeah. Yeah.
We've had some exciting, exciting developments in our household. Now that mini soup has their driver's license and a car. And all the parties hanging with the friends. Yeah, dance dance team. Woo. Yeah. But it means that I don't have to take them to dance anymore, which is.
I was going to ask about that because I remember the biggest thing when I got my license was it wasn't I get to go hang out with my friends more. It was like, Oh, now I have to drive myself to work. Oh my gosh. In the in the chat, Nameless has said, says I forgot about the hole in J's roof.
I think everyone did except for J. Yeah. No, I woke up to looking at it every day for about a week and a half. So yeah. Oh my goodness. Speaking of the live stream chat, one of the other benefits is the whole discord.
And this week in the discord, well, the last couple weeks, the new relay branding has been announced and confirmed. And it has created some excitement and some tapes and some chaos. And there are some truly beautiful.
And I say it, not ironically, beautiful creations in the discord that if you remember, you should definitely check out. Kathy, something interesting happened when relay announced that they were changing their branding. Apparently, the rest of the world did as well.
Walmart decided to do a redesign of their brand. And you know, it I can't tell a difference. It looks exactly the same. I'm going to put it in the chat as well. So if I can go to corporate corporate dot Walmart dot com. Oh, wait. No, that doesn't show the old one. I was just saying. That's fine.
Look at look at the new one and tell me how it's different. No, I need to compare. Yeah. See, look at that. It's obviously a chunkier. Oh, oh, oh, yeah. It's thicker, more rounded. Yeah. So for those, yeah, they got bolder with their colors is what I'm saying. And the text and the text too. Yeah.
But I don't think it required an entire like whole thing. I bet the Walmart discord is going wild right now. OK. OK. The number of YouTube videos that were linked in the Google's. Yeah. And it's a brighter color. So it looks more like less faded almost. Yeah.
And of course, you're not, you're probably listener, not here to listen to us regale the subtle but impactful differences of either the relay or Walmart branding.
But yeah, you're here to learn about all the things that we want to talk about, including what we did in our co-working, which we and our superconductor friends discussed. Oh, yeah, we did talk about transition lenses. And I want to hate them. Yeah.
And how much I love them, except when I walked into the room and like I have my transition lenses, we're still in sunglasses mode. And Kathy thought I was just being the biggest. I don't know another word for debags. I'm just going to say debag. This is a family friendly show.
But yeah, we talked about that. We talked about promotions. We actually did work because now I have a new fancy job. I'm all excited about it and hyper focusing on work and stuff. So I couldn't ignore everyone else's needs and just be loud and talkative.
I know it's amazing how much we actually got done. Amazing. If any of those things sound fun, visit Iamasypreconductor.com to become a member today. Letter I, letter M, letter A, superconductor.com. And now we need a shout out. We got a shout out from Mike, our checklist enthusiast of the show.
So we talked about last episode. We talked about the fact that my Christmas tree was still up, spoiler alert, it is still up. It makes me so happy to turn on the lights. And I don't care what Jay thinks. But Mike mentioned that Jay takes down the Christmas tree on midnight on December 26th.
I mean, pretty close, pretty close. And again, if I could, I just wouldn't put a tree up at all. So like, this is, I feel like what I'm being is very flexible in understanding of other people's needs. Something like that. Yep. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. All right.
Well, what about our connections? How did you do on your connection check? So I'm hoping that this was my connection, because this is what was in the dock. What was in the dock? I totally forgot what my connection was. So therefore. There was a record of them. Yeah.
If only I could like go to the previous episode. And just, I don't know, just type in, let's see, conduit, relayed out of film slash conduit, where you can go and find all of our previous episodes, episode 93. Yep. Do work on my presentations. That was my connection.
It's almost like I copied and pasted it from our tech. Oh, well, see, you can just set that. Oh, my gosh. Well, anyway, we don't have enough time to do this.
Anyway, I didn't sit down and do like dedicated work on my presentations, but what I caught myself doing was like getting ideas on the presentation and then like documenting those ideas and saying, like, oh, I need to add that. I need to add something about that.
And then adding that into drafts and like just being able, so that when I do sit down to work on it, I'll have all these ideas and I can start putting them together and then form like actually putting the sides and pieces and all that stuff in.
So like this, this was, I didn't like dedicate time to doing this, but it was something that was top of mind. So I gave myself a yellow circle. What about you? Nice. My connection was to rest and I gave myself a big green check mark. I rested pretty much every day.
I would take some time and go and sit on the couch and use my fancy heated wrist brace thing for reasons that will be in the after show. But also on Sunday, I had an all day reading date with two of my friends and it was fantastic. And I finished 392 pages of an entire book.
Wow, that's more than I've read in the last three years. Yeah, unsurprising, unsurprising.
How did our conductors do? Well, our artist of the show, Carly, said, Green Book, I found out my new friend runs a weekly silent book club, a place that you will never find J, an event where you read books together in the same place quietly and then and you attended and you actually read. Good job.
That's awesome. Amazing. Our soprano of the show, Debo says connection check, green heart, I hemmed a pair of trousers, a necessity when you are short as I am. I don't know how that works because I'm definitely not short but congratulations, I'm so happy for you.
I've always wanted to learn how to hem trousers for trousers reasons, I guess. The now Debo can teach you. Yes, the awe of the show, awe. Said yellow circle, that's what they call it in Minnesota. Some floor piles remain but there are fewer of them but I did smash through three puzzles.
Wow, that's awesome. Way to go. Our pathologist of the show, Laura says connection check, orange heart, I did a good job journaling but did switch formats midway through. I would like to have a somewhat more consistent system.
The second part of the connection was to have somewhere to store things I'm not working on right now. I did okay with this but currently it's not a very usable system more to come. Good. I'm proud of you. You got a good process.
Our identical twin of the show, Aaron said yellow circle, I got a bit delayed on my freelancing work as my contact was on the weather but did make some progress hoping to wrap this particular feature up this weekend.
Oh, tell me about everybody's been under the weather lately so like I think something's going around. Go get vaccinated, I don't care what your politician tells you. Anyways, our checklist enthusiast of the show, Mike says previous check in check. Ooh, previous connection, yellow heart.
Clean up office and closet after holidays. I worked on it some but got distracted by other tasks. Our robotics engineer of the show, Aiden says green heart. I managed to play it a little bit and whoa, boy, I rusty. It's going to take a little bit more practice before I'm back to my old ability.
Oh, keep, keep at it. Our physical therapist of the show, Daniel says connection check. No idea. Like of sleep with baby, we are just keeping heads above water. Sounds like you succeeded. Yep.
Our fish bear of the show, Fishy Guy says yellow circle, prepping house went a little better but I wonder if I've underestimated the scale of the project. Well, you either underestimate, overestimate, or correctly estimate, so good job in getting one of the three. Yes.
Carl of all trades of the show, Carl says connection check, yellow square. Did not write any code but did respond to an email from May 2024 saying I was going to run state level coding contest this April 2025. Then scheduled and hosted meeting with co-host to continue prep work.
I am very proud of you for replying to that email that desperately needed a reply well done. I'm glad you remembered in February and not April. And our tech podcast listener of the show, Pillix says Greenheart did work on the game, ended up not submitting it but it was a great learning experience.
I mean, I think that's the biggest part of doing code jams is getting the experience, not necessarily getting the game out the door. I think things like that in Neno Rimo are excellent for doing, for just learning.
Our nameless of the show nameless says connection check, red circle junk drawers, we're not cleaned nor thought of. You know what, that's okay. Nothing wrong with that. All right, this episode of Condo It is brought to you by Pika.

Our thanks to Pika for their support of the show and all of Riele. Pika dot page sounds great. I know, it's Pika's such a fun way to say it. Pika, very Pokemon, but still super fun. Also considering I like brick to my website last week and it was down for like three days.
Pika is like a thing that I was just like, hmm, I want to look at that real soon. I got it working again, but. But the fact that it got brick to that's not fun. And you had to spend that time and energy and effort and that's unfortunate.
Okay, so I asked you, hey, what do you have an idea for a topic? I had a couple, but you know what? Let's ask, let's open it up. And you said, what did you say? I said household chores. You said house responsibilities and learning them by booking a flight.
Now, did I know what that meant? Not at all. And now based on the notes that you put in the doc, I actually get a better idea of what you meant for our audience.
Would you explain what the heck you meant when you said house responsibilities and then changed that to a different topic? Yeah, so I can't remember if we talked about it on the main show or not, but I had a, the weather has been weird.
We had some, we had some snow in Atlanta, which is always worrisome. And we had some water damage that happened. It was really minor. We're not revisiting the whole like, Jay had to replace all of the floors downstairs due to extreme water damage.
This was just like some minor flooding that happened and it had caused water damage on our ceiling in our bedroom.
And that left me with fixed plumbing, which is good, but a giant hole in my ceiling, so that's because I couldn't, you know, we had a plumber, not a general contractor or someone like that. So they were like, I fixed a problem. Here's a hole, you're going to have to do that.
So we were kind of left with two issues. One, the ceiling fan that was where the giant hole was, was shorted out because of electricity and water. They're not friends. So we had to replace install a ceiling fan.
We also had to make sure that our electrical stuff was actually in a good healthy spot, which was, you know, that's important because again, why buy a new ceiling fan just to have it blow out as well or cause, you know, future problems or start a house fire or something.
So we needed to hire an electrician, but we also needed to fix the giant hole in our ceiling and install a new ceiling fan over at it.
So I was kind of left with this idea of like, okay, I've got to spend hundreds, maybe thousands of dollars having people come out and inspect things and do things and the whole might have to get larger and all this other stuff.
How do I leverage this situation in a way that's going to, you know, turn out positive? And I also have to put out there, I'm not a handy person by default. Like I'm not, I'm not up there replacing drywall. Like that's, it's not going to be me. Mostly cause I don't want to do it.
And if I tried to do it, it would be bad. So my father-in-law is a contractor, general handy person and a licensed electrician. So Haza, or when they're chicken dinner.
Exactly, hey, hey, dad, do you want to come spend time with your grandchild but also replaces giant hole in my wall or my ceiling?
Because the reality is it costs me less to pay for the parts, assist with doing the things and just pay for the plane ticket than it would to hire the electrician, hire the contractor, do the thing.
Now granted, you saved what you saved in money, I lost in time because, you know, my father-in-law was like, well, I can't do it this weekend. So it's gonna have to wait a week and then all that other stuff.
Plus booking flights, you know, near the flight time means the flights are a little bit more expensive and all that stuff. So they were like those costs, but ultimately it was just a better opportunity, a better experience.
And also we get to have fun and hang out with my father-in-law who lives, you know, I think 12 hours away by car and, you know, like, just a couple hours by plate. So like let's make that happen, let's do that. Yeah. That's great.
 But what I didn't realize was how much I would learn in the process of like doing all of this stuff, like I knew how to install a ceiling fan, but I never knew how to patch drywall, which is just in general something that people should learn because if you are, if you ever rent a place, you're gonna wanna learn how to patch drywall, just in case you ever have to patch drywall.
Or lose your deposit.
 The, I also learned like, you know, since my father-in-law is a contractor, like he taught me how to do some of the other things and we had little projects around the house that just hadn't been done because I was like, well, I'm not gonna do them and they're not really a big enough problem to pay someone to come and do them.
And, you know, I was like, wait, how would you fix this? I was like, oh, you could just do this, this, and this. And it's like $5 at Home Depot. And I'm like, oh, I can do that. And then going and doing. And this made me think of a new take on the phrase supervised learning.
Kathy, are you familiar with supervised learning? I am. And it's one of my favorite, I was gonna say it's one of my favorite things, but that's not. That's, that's not quite correct.
 But it's one of my favorite things when I am, say, getting a new client and we're working through and learning new things is either whichever direction it's gonna go, either they are walking me through how they do something or they are, I am walking them through how I did something so that they are able to do it themselves.
It's kind of like, I think there's the doctor's term of like C1 assist one, do one, or I forget what the phrase is, I'm sure it's super fancy, but in that mindset is the same idea of like learning with support.
So you're not alone, you have somebody, so you're not gonna break something to the point where it can't be fixed. And you're gonna be able to really learn because you're doing it? Yes, yes, thank you, Aiden. C1, do one, teach one. Yeah. Thank you.
Because you have that support, but somebody is not just like expecting you to pay attention and do it, you have the power to be able to really get it done. And get the muscle memory on how to do it. And so you'll learn it better.
Yeah, I think the biggest thing for me was, as I was telling my father-in-law, like if I were going to do this on my own, it would take me days to do the thing that would take maybe a couple of hours. And it's not a matter of like, oh, I'm not capable of doing this.
It's like the pure, like how would I even start? It's like go watch a YouTube video of something, go buy all this stuff, start working on it, realize that I didn't buy everything that I needed, go back, buy more stuff.
And then like have to like pause, watch the video over again, do the thing, pause, watch the video over again, do the thing. And then like at the end of it, be like a week in, finally finish it, it looked like garbage, and then also realize that I have all of these leftover pieces. Yes.
And you're so frustrated because you didn't know if you were doing it right, or like there's so many layers involved when trying to do something new. So as I mentioned before, Mini Soup got their driver's license, and they got a new car. Well, I say new, it's very much not new.
A 2000 Toyota Corolla. In pretty darn good shape, however, there were still things that needed to be fixed on it. We got it from a friend of a friend, and got a discount on the price because there were things that needed to be fixed.
The biggest thing was apparently on these 2000, early 2000 Corolas, the door handles are really like soft.
So if you're use it wrong, the like actual class part of the door handle, you know the part that you actually like unlock, like it pops the little thing to actually open the car, broke off on the driver's side. And the inside one also broke off.
So in order to get into the car to drive at home, I had to use the key to wedge it under the little, like the main part of it to lift it up, and then to get out of the car once I got it home, I had to crawl out through the passenger's side door because I couldn't open the door from the inside.
But this was great. This was a perfect opportunity to let Mini Soup explore the joys of vehicle ownership. We have a friend of ours that does our car stuff for. A friend's husband, my best friend's husband, is fantastic, he's so patient. And together the two of them swapped out the door handles.
We also learned that the brake light, one of the brake lights in the back was not working. So went to AutoZone, got the part, went home, and my brother taught them how to check the bulb.
We walked through, here's how to check the oil, here's how to check all of the other fluids, and that sort of stuff.
And it was something that I could have done myself watching the YouTube's and whatnot, but having somebody that was experienced to do the teaching who knows like a better information about cars to then give Mini Soup the power and like the understanding of like, hey, this is your car now.
Here's like the pieces that you need to be aware of. Here's, you know, how this is working so that when something breaks in the future, they're gonna have a little bit more autonomy to be able to ask for what needs to happen.
And I think that's really important to develop the confidence to be able to do the things that need to happen. Yeah, and I think that the biggest part of that too is the additive learning that goes on with that.
Like learning how to install door knobs, or not door knobs, like learning how to install the door handles on your car, you're probably like, okay, how often am I going to install a door handle on my car, but also what were all the tools? Clearly often enough.
But like what were the tools that were required in order to do that? And then now you have experience using those tools as well. Like, we had to remove a mirror in our bathroom. I didn't also throw in there like we remodeled our bathroom in the process as well.
Of just like, hey, having a general handy person around, like it gave me the encouragement to like do bigger and better things. I'm like, oh, hey, I wanted to remodel our bathroom. Is that a thing that we can do? Like it's not a big remodel.
It's just like this big thing of removing a giant mirror and replacing it with new light fixtures and a smaller thing and having to repaint and stuff. Had I not had someone come in and do that, like I never would have even asked or thought about doing that.
And I definitely wouldn't have done it myself, but then also like, I have removed a mirror from a bathroom. That is terrifying. Like that is a big pain of glass that has to be like removed from a wall.
And as with most things in our like in this show that we've done over time, most of the benefits that I get come from having Brittany. But the beauty of that was like, everyone was like, oh, you got to get a pry bar and like pry the mirror off of the wall.
And I'm like, but I'll put a hole in the wall. Wait a minute. I know how to fix holes in the wall. Hey! So there's just there's something about like the additive confidence and experience of like, well, I've replaced a door handle.
I can surely figure out how to change the oil or I can surely figure out how to do this. And then I can go and teach other people how to do it like Kathy. Yes, exactly, exactly. I love, I love that.
Like the idea of all of these things, these options that you can get the power that you need and the self support to do the things to be successful as a human.
Yeah, it's, it feels like there was definitely, I don't want to say like a life level, like unlocked, but I mean, in some ways kind of like, just like now how many soup knows the lingo around car handles and things like, I don't know what those are.
I don't know what the door lever flange thing is called, but I'm sure they do now. Like, well, they probably don't know what it's called, but they know how to replace it and they know the complex, like they had to take off the entire inside of the door, which totally makes sense.
Like I didn't even think about that until after like watching the, starting to watch the YouTube and I was like, oh, yeah, of course it makes sense. You need to undo the inside of the door so that you can connect all the levers so that it actually will lock and unlock. Like duh.
They're in that, like that's cool because windows, like the motors and windshields, those things will burn out. Like they burn out, like that's one of the like more common.
I bought this used car and like what are going to be some of the things that I have to think about over time? Like your windshield just not rolling down anymore is like a thing, a common thing. And also if you've taken that panel apart now, you know where all that stuff goes and how to fix it.
So that's super awesome. Yeah, this type of an idea translates to so many different parts of life.
Like if you've never, I don't know, cooked Thanksgiving turkey and like you're struggling to like figure out how to do it, you know, having somebody like supporting, supporting your family growing up, being able to make it.
Like being able to do that means that you're going to have the power to then, oh, I don't know, make a beef wellington or something. And I think that's why like cooking shows are so popular is that it kind of gives you the power and the super vision to make it work. Yeah.
Do the things because you're having somebody show you while you're doing it. Obviously I am not the type of person that cooks while I'm watching a show about the cooking because I don't cook. But for the most part, like, yeah, yeah, that's kind of the idea.
I think the other beauty of that is that there's often this like, I don't want to say like contractual trade of knowledge, but the people around you have skills that you probably could learn. And you have skills that those people probably would like to learn as well.
Like one of the things that I sent a picture to Kathy and Kathy didn't remark on them at all, which makes me feel like they're not, I didn't do a good job. But I sent Kathy a picture of the mirrors. And one of the things that I did with the mirrors they used to just be a slab of glass.
But what we did was I actually made the frames and painted them to go around the mirrors.
And the nice thing about them is that it was like, overall, I think it was like the $30 in materials to like basically turn to ugly slabs of glass into like to, you know, painted framed mirrors that are really large.
I have to protect myself because I did not reply to this because there was literally no context. Stem me this photo, when you were supposed to be on the call, I was thinking, huh, is this because I don't know your father-in-law is standing on the counter in his socks by the way, which terrifies me.
Why, the socks and like two slippery, two slippery. That's how you fall and break your head open. He's licensed, he knows what he's doing. Okay, but still. But like there's no context. Like what am I looking at? I don't know.
I, what, what you got to say, look at these gray mirrors that I just made or something like that.
 Or hey, we're gonna talk about, like I need communication because I'm not gonna comment on a thing that you sent me when you were supposed to be in the call because I was like, oh, maybe he, that he's sending this from the bathroom because he needed to make sure that his father-in-law doesn't fall off the counter in his socks.
So all of that to say communication is super important, right? That's the lesson learned. Yeah, and that includes when learning. Yeah, and but like even just communicating some of the skills that you have, because like my father-in-law was like, I don't, I don't do that.
Like I'm not, I don't do design. I grabbed the cables and moved the things and make, and like fixed the holes in the wall. I was like, oh, my mother trained me on HGTV.
And my mother is also the type of person who would go to like a thrift store, get something really, really ugly, take it apart, and then like paint and do stuff and put it back together and forced me to help so that like now I know how to do some of that stuff.
And it was really cool in like going, okay, hey, we don't have to buy replacement mirrors. We'll just use the ones that we have. I can go get chair casing, and I didn't know what it was called, so I just kept calling it like crown molding. And he was like, oh, by the way, that's not crown molding.
That's a chair casing. And I was like, oh, there's a difference. He was, yes, it's definitely a difference. And here's the difference. And now you know.
 So being able to effectively communicate those things and go, oh, I know that if I do this and this and this, I can like paint a base coat and then put like a gold layer underneath it and then like put a layer, a light layer of black on top so that when the light like hits it, it'll have like this shimmer effect that makes it look like it's like a bronze that's like faded and worn.
And when he saw it and we put together, he goes like, I did not know what you were talking about, but now that I see it, this looks really good. And there was just a part of me that was like, oh, wow, I showed him how to do a thing and he showed me how to do like 15 things.
And in the end, like just learning from one another and there have been other little things that I've been able, like I showed him how to prepare a espresso and things like that. And he was just like, I did not expect to learn as much as I did coming in and doing this.
So it's, I don't know, it's just really fun being able to say like, we did a lot of supervised learning this week where I learned how to fix houses and stuff and he learned how to make good coffee. And I feel like that's an even trait. Yeah, absolutely.
And he got to spend time and know what his granddaughter likes. Absolutely. Yeah. I think that's the, especially with grandparents, like that's the big thing is like, hey, spend time with your grandkids, you know. So I think what we're learning is that learning with supervision is very helpful.
Yeah. It's fun. It's more than helpful like you. It's fun. It's rewarding. You get this amazing sense of accomplishment. And I would, I would say like, this is a great time to probably have quality time with someone that you probably wouldn't like, volunteer to spend time with.
 Not that I don't like my father-in-law, but like, if I'm like, I've got three days, what am I going to do in the list, the multiple choice list where it includes like sleep or play video games, go to a baseball game by myself, spend the week fixing a hole in the wall with my father-in-law or something else.
Like, I'm probably not picking that one, but when you do, you get a lot out of it. And it really is nice. This episode of Condoet is brought to you by Jelly. Jelly is the best way for small teams to share an email inbox.

Now, before we move on, Jay, you mentioned you were really excited about this sponsor and talked about it a little bit, even if you already went with the different solutions. So what we're saying is that the sponsorship came just a little bit too late. It did.
This was one where we were talking about we need to get our domain, we need for the nonprofit that I work with, the domain we have, we did this thing where now we have people who are assuming these leadership roles and the leadership roles are only for a period of time.
So I don't want to have to give everybody a username and password to add this thing to their mailbox and then in a year or six months or whatever.
Now they're like uninstalling that or if they forget to or they just don't, then like now they have to go do something else and someone else comes in and now you have people who are like reading emails that don't necessarily have access to them.
I feel like something like Jelly would have been great because I could just go add this person, remove this person, add this new person in and like I never have to sit there and mess around with mailboxes ever again. Sadly, the money has been spent.
So and what I will say is the money was spent on a less inferior solution. So I would, or I guess an inferior solution. So I would definitely consider it in the future. I'm definitely looking at Jelly for something in the future that I would, I would definitely want to sign up for. Yeah, yeah.
I have a couple of different projects that we have a shared inbox and instead of having to send a message of hey, did you send this reply or what do you think about this or any sort of conversation being able to do it right in the email? Sounds pretty great to me. Definitely.
All right, Jay, what is your connection? You know, I'm, so I'm kind of done with the handy stuff for now. Like I'm not gonna keep that momentum going and take on more tasks. I told my father-in-law like, I'm tempted to just start like breaking things so that I can fix them.
And I was told that I better not do that or I'll get in trouble. But instead, I'm going to say that I've got to finish my new management tasks. And I'm just gonna put do management tasks. Focus on doing management tasks, there we go.
Because I have a routine, I'm so used to that routine that routine's been shaken up a couple of different ways. So now I need to make sure that I make dedicated time for that. I love that idea and concentration.
I'm trying to decide if I want to, you know, I don't think I can do this as a connection yet because it's really gonna depend on what my doctor says later this afternoon, which will be in the post show. We'll have that bit of a conversation.
But what I do need to do is I need, desperately need to clear off my desk. I really need to clean my whole office, but my desk especially is getting chaotic. So I am going to clear off my desk. That sounds clear. I don't, I wanted, okay.
People who are not superconductors and are having gone to the letter I, letter A, superconductor.com to become a superconductor today.
Like I can't emphasize enough how much I want to talk about this topic of just like the small things being so important when they are, when you're having to work around medical stuff. So like we're gonna dive into that at the end of the show.
I would encourage you to become a superconductor because there are gonna be more and more topics like this that I could go on and on and on about and we don't have the time to do it right now. And unfortunately a lot of this stuff is as it happens.
So yeah, if you want to get that second topic become a superconductor like it will be good. It will be good for you. Yes, what about our conductors, future connections? Okay, our artist of the show says, our Carly says continue applying for jobs.
I almost want to do the clapping thing but I know that's, that's Pillix's thing. So keep applying for jobs. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Our new conductor, Mike says new connection check and with the cute little cowboy smiley face. The cowboy emoji of the show. Yes, oh, dude, that's it, that's it.
Put that in, put that in the spreadsheet. The cowboy emoji of the show says. Our cowboy emoji of the show says trying to focus more on my daily tasks around the apartment and trying to get them done and also trying to keep up a regular exercise routine.
That's a lot, that's a lot for this first connection and I'm excited for you and proud of you and let's see what you do. Also, let us know if cowboy emoji of the show is an unacceptable option. We will pick whatever you want. But for right now, that is your of the show name.
Kathy, I tried to put it in the thing and my brain broke. I genuinely tried and I was like, wait, what do I do? I will do it. The funniest part to me is the fact that you built the system. Yeah, I did. You created it. You're correct, but you've done such a good job. Oops, see, I'm breaking stuff.
Oh my gosh, stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. I was a friend of the show Devos says, nope, that's also the wrong, you know what? I'm just gonna go over here because I can't, I can't ask Kathy to do 8,000 things. I'm gonna just go over here and I'm gonna say, oh that's...
Did I do all of these wrong? I totally did. Yeah. Yeah, okay, hold on. Our soprano of the show, Devos says, new connection sticking with the sewing theme, I'm going to mend a sheet that has a tear in it. Wow, see, I love it. That momentum, the momentum, I love it.
The a of the show, a says, next connection. The remaining floor piles will be dealt with. Also, I want to hang some stuff on the walls that have been sitting around for ages. My degree deserves to be shown off, not stuffed in a bag. Yeah, it does. Flippin' lootly.
Our pathologist of the show, Laura, says, busy work, we coming up, connection is to keep a list of minimum, keep the list to a minimum. Ooh, a list of minimum also sounds great.
Keeping a list to the minimum and focus on the important things happening at work for the next two weeks without doing a bunch of extra nonsense. Thank you, Laura. I really like that idea of having a list of minimum. Maybe try that.
All right, our identical twin of the show, Aaron, says, new connection. Some social conversations recently made me realize I should try to play some guitar more. Doesn't have to be the last tricky song I was trying to learn. Maybe try learning something simple and new or even just improvising.
Yes, get those skills up, like practice them, and then you can start trying to push yourself a little bit more. Our checklist, Enthusiasts of the show, Mike, says, focus on getting the office closet organized. Once the closet is organized, I can move on to other areas. Ooh, I like that.
Picking a small place to start with and then like continuing it. And maybe that's how you get the closet organized is just cleaning a portion of the closet first to get that momentum. About that. Our robotics engineer of the show, Aiden, says, keep up my exercise routine.
I want to try to add at least half an hour of extra activity a day, even if that just means going for a walk over lunch. Whether admitting, of course, this Canadian winter has been wild recently.
Listen, if I know anything about Canadians, just suck it up in negative 20 degree weather to walk your lunch, right? That's totally how that works. Yeah, I'm not in no comment. The physical therapist of the show, Daniel, says, have finished registering for baby insurance. That's a thing.
Gotta keep it simple. Baby for insurance. Oh, it's like baby insurance. Do they replace it? If you. Yes. Wow. No, someone just needs to read. For the record, Daniel, you wrote it correctly. Yeah. Just clearly doesn't read very often.
I love that gotta keep it simple and sobering that has to be done. And I was like, wait a minute, you gotta keep the baby sober? Yes, yes you do. Fish bear of the show, Fishy Kai says, new connection. I'm going to attempt time tracking. Oh, good luck. No comment.
Our carla ball trades at the show says to write a Python script to generate contest input and validate student submission recruit judges to help judge code. Set a meeting to go over proper judges. I love the very specificness of these.
Our tech podcast listener of the show, Pilex says, new connection. Work on my ballatro mod. I'm trying to make it read all the shop and pack game state by the next conduit. That's impressive. I, okay. I am kind of, I tried playing ballatro. I know it's been like the biggest game.
And it just does not work for my brain. And you know what? That's okay. That's okay. I, I sense an early opportunity for a St. Jude milestone. Make, make Kathy play all the latest hit games. Let's do it.
Anyway, our name list of the show nameless says, try again with the drawers and persistently remind the professor to complete the review for the capstone project. This is the final obstacle in the program. Can't believe we made it this far.
I can't believe we've gotten to watch you make it this far nameless. So that's amazing. Oh, so proud of all of our conductors. Our Oracle of the show, so says new connection. I've been way too busy at work.
So it's time to get back on the wagon with swimming and meditation and being realistic to start with. Go swimming once a week, meditate twice a week. Oh, so good. I'm so proud of what our conductors are going to be doing this next fortnight.
