From Relay F.O. you're listening to Conduot, the show we Condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduot, the show that whether we are tired or not, we show up. This episode is brought to you by our amazing superconductors.
I'm Jay and with me is the unicorn of the internet, the unicorn's tiretist internet. No, the unicorn does it the unicorn's tiretist internet? Yes, the internet is the most tiretist unicorn. There we go. Hey, Kathy. Hey. Um, exhausted.
I feel a little bit like EOR, which is, you know what, there is nothing wrong with being tired, with embracing the current state of life. What is happening? I'm here and I'm doing my best. And I think that's all I can say, but that's, it's okay.
You know what, it's going to be, it is what it is and I'm going to keep hanging in there.
But yeah, it's been, it's been an emotional roller coaster for a while, especially yesterday when we learned one of our former neighbors and one of many soups, very good friends who was 14, unfortunately passed from a drug overdose and it was a lot. Yeah, a lot.
So, yeah, having a heaviness, drugs are bad, y'all. Yeah, drugs are bad. Yeah, I have no words.
So I'm going to just continue on and say, this week in the discord, hey, did you know, Kathy, that the podcast, the thought is upon us in six months? Yeah, how dare, how dare Steven do that to me? He also earlier this, no, when did he do it last week?
Last week sent me a screenshot of, like sent me a link to the document for the planning for 2025.
And that was a little bit traumatizing. That's just me. Yeah, so we're getting these initial thoughts down, keeping the initial, what nots. So yeah, it's going to be, we're getting started and that's really scary.
Yeah, also, I don't know if you noticed, but this is episode, this is conduit episode 97. Woo, good team. What the heck? How have we, like, it feels both like we've been doing this forever and also that we just started. We talked about it.
This, that, this is going to be going into the fifth year of conduit, which is wild to imagine. The show is going to elementary school. Our show just said it, it's first curse word on accident. It just repeated something that it heard from, from one of these parents.
Funny enough, the parent is probably Kathy, which is wild. And yeah, that's probably what a curse word came from. Oh, my goodness. But it's awesome to think about too. Like, we, I really do love this show. I love the connections that I've made. I love the people that we've met through this so much.
I mean, we've seen, and obviously we're going to go into this more in a future episode. Not, I'm not, I'm not going to make this now, but I am, I'm just like thinking about how many life changes we've gone through together. You know, so many new jobs moving marriages and break engagements.
And these things have happened. And our conductors have shared with us on the show. And I think that's really special. Yeah, that's, that's, that's so wild.
And one of the places that they do share some of those things is in our co-working, where the last co-working, Kathy had super buttery smooth keyboard. Like, that was fun. We talked about technology as we do sometimes. We talked about coffee machines. Oh, my goodness.
I've never wanted to just like blow through a budget so quickly. So amazing. We talked about how, like, how far people are willing to travel for their job and like, how that impacts, like, moving decisions and all these other things.
And then we did, like, the most terrible thing that someone could do, which is turning on notifications for your podcast player. Absolutely not never again. You can't make me also. There are some people who will go unnamed. I know it's not nameless. Nameless is fine.
It's other people who will go unnamed that we are like. How? Just how? I thought I was bad. I just subscribed to all the podcasts. Other people actually cue them. I only cue like 20 or 30 shows. Some people got hundreds of episodes in the queue still. Thousands. Thousands. It's gross.
It's what it is. But anyway, if hanging out in the discord or hanging out with us in the off-leaks for co-working sounds like fun, become a super conductor. Go to like relay.fm slash conduit and then do become a member. Or you can go to our super fun URL, which is I'm a superconductor.com.
Letter I letter M letter A superconductor.com and become a member today. Shout outs. Kathy, you did a wonderful guest show while I was in Florida fighting gators and jackwars and turtles and the HOA. I met a really, really wild HOA while I was down there. That was fun.
I left got held up at the gate for 20 minutes. Oh my gosh. We were at an Airbnb that was gated and yeah. Oh my goodness. Very, very much. But yeah, I spoke to Jane Madeline Mattingley, whose book actually comes out today as we're recording this on March 18th.
So I will once again put the link in the show notes. I started reading it last night. It's so good. It's really, I feel like it's a conversation that I think is going to start being had more often and that makes me really, really happy. Yeah.
I was really challenged just by the general idea of body grief. And I think that one of the things I really loved about the conversation is it felt so accessible whether you were dealing with a chronic issue or just a stage in life. Yeah.
I suffer from a lot of asthma related issues that cause being fit and having good fitness as a problem.
So a lot of my, you know, as I see myself like gaining weight and having to manage that, but also not just being able to do the things that I was comfortable doing not even two or three years ago.
It does just put me in a weird funk and I just love how even though I'm not dealing with things at the same level that the Jane was dealing with, it felt like I was still, you know, my, my needs were still being kind of discussed and addressed in that as well. Yeah.
And for anyone that maybe missed the book is called This Is Body Grief by Jane Mattingley and it's a discussion that kind of talks about this idea that almost like you're feeling like your body is failing you.
 If something is going wrong, maybe you, you know, even as something as simple as like stubbing your toe all the way up to like chronic illness and and these things can be really important to kind of recognize and acknowledge the fact that body grief is just like regular grief, you know, morning, the loss of things.
And I think that's, yeah, I think it's a, I'm really proud of the conversation that we had and the book itself is, is pretty fantastic. Yeah. And again, thank you, Jane, for being such an awesome guest co host. Spoiler, we have a lot of guest co hosts coming.
Yeah, it's going to be, it's going to be, we talked about this a little bit in the pre show, but basically, I am going to be home for about 18 of the 31 days of April. And I'd stop counting, but I think I might have you beat. I don't doubt it. I don't doubt it.
That doesn't count travel days though. That's just like, yeah, so basically I'm not used to this. I mean, I guess I should be since it's, it's definitely happened before. But yeah, it's going to be a busy, busy month.
And so we are going to make sure that we obviously record our episodes, but yeah, there's going to be a whole lot less of J and I together, even though we're going to make it work as best as best as we can. I, I too am in home 18 days. Oh my goodness.
So yeah, and they're not the same 18, which is yeah, that's the hard part. It would be one thing if we were all like if we just happened to be gone the same days. There is overlay to the point where I'm in Atlanta when Jay is not. So that, that said, but you know, it'll be okay.
If for folks who don't realize there's like this big event that Kathy does in Atlanta every year. And last year was the first time that Kathy and I got to meet in person because Kathy's been going to Atlanta since before I moved to Atlanta.
And I was looking at like the episode numbers then and I was like, Oh, I think Kathy's going to be in Atlanta around episode 100. And then we like start trying to plan things and we're like, what if we do a live show would be so cool.
And then all of a sudden it's just like, I'm not in, I'm not in Atlanta that you're not in Atlanta. And it's not the 100th episode. But yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's very close. But this is, this mapping is hard. Since I'll, since I'll be in Chicago, maybe I'll, I'll do a guest episode of Roboism.
There we go. Oh, there. Good. Maybe you can get my co-host of Roboism to actually publish the episode we recorded three months ago. Oh, nice. I'll just listen to it. I'll just get a local copy. Oh, there you go.
But yeah, nameless, your idea of having the superconductors just take over, you know what? Maybe one of these days will have to happen. I mean, there, there is a, we're going to. That's right. I think we are going to talk about it a little bit in the, the main topic.
But there, there is a world where we're like, do we just have like a designated designated conductor? It's like the designated survivor. Oh, my gosh. That would be an option. That would be an option. All right. Moving along. It's time for our connection check. Kathy. How did you do that? Yeah.
I was going to clean out my dresser and it's a big red circle for me. I am hanging in there. I will say that. I am doing what I can and finding some piece in the, the things that I can do. But let me just give you an idea of kind of my schedule this last week. I was so overwhelmed with everything.
I forgot to wish my mom a happy birthday. Oh, no. I am 42 years old and I've never done that before. And it took several days for me to realize that I had forgotten it because I didn't even think of like I could not remember what day of the month it was.
So yeah, that's, that's kind of where I am sitting in my life right now. And I am, again, I'm doing the best that I can. And it's okay. Obviously my mom is fantastic and she forgave me and yada yada yada. And I felt terrible.
And to the point of like this past weekend was a surprise at dance competition. You know, you're shocked. But we're at almost a state for the high school team. And so in order to get things done in time in between taking photos at the competition this past weekend.
I also was editing the photos that I had taken on a Friday of the high school team with their like their state theming stuff. So I am doing my best. And sometimes it feels like it's not enough. And I'm just again trying to remind myself that it's okay. What I'm doing is is going to be enough.
And yeah, I'm hanging in there. I'm first and foremost shot out to a happy birthday wishes to Jay Zs 2024 winner Kathy's mom. But yeah, it's it's it's we're going to come back to this. We're going to come back to this. I don't want us I don't want us to put the show all wonky.
But yes, the feels the feels are definitely there. My connection that I did not add to the show notes because Kathy didn't prompt me and therefore time did not exist. And I did not know a day it was, which was fine. Was to try out one of our previous sponsors, which is the P app.
I was very intrigued by this. I committed to using it. And honestly, I have probably three different applications as well as a physical notebook that I could use for. Like logging things.
And this isn't because they've given me money, although that does help anybody else that wants to become a sponsor and have us test your apps. I have tested every single app that someone has had us sponsor because I do believe in like I'm not going to just talk about a thing.
Blindly, but the P app is probably one of the like best for my brain logging apps ever. And the the annoyance it's the one of the only apps I actually keep notifications on.
And yes, it gives me I had I had my first headache like in a while just from like dehydration from you know ADHD related for getting to eat and drink. And stuff. I had that Sunday was a Sunday. Yeah, it was Sunday.
And like I looked back and I looked at the app and it was like, well, of course you did dummy like. You haven't drank enough water. Exactly. Like I just I just like without even figuring like I could just look and go. Everything is significantly lower than it was before.
Why? Because because I was being dumb. No other reason. Not dumb. You just forgot it. No, I was being dumb. Because I got the notification. So I could have just like did like a water check and drink water. But I did it. Yeah. So. Okay. Yeah.
So yeah, there's definitely this feeling of like, you know, hey, shout out shout out to the P app. I was I was using it. I was using it all throughout, you know, my time in in Florida.
And that was one of the reasons why I wanted to use it was because when I when I travel, one, I gain a ton of weight. And I don't drink hardly any water at all. And instead I will wind up drinking like more alcohol than usual.
So then it's like not to a point where it's like, you know pounding them back on a regular day. Like more than none. Yeah. I might well, I would have normally like one to two glasses of whiskey like a week. And when I'm traveling, usually we're going out every single night.
And I will usually have like a glass of whiskey as a nightcap. So like, yeah, at least at least two to three times as much as I normally would have. So like there's there is a level of dehydration that comes with that. That's a little difficult. But yes, use the P app. It's great.
I have logged not that anyone is asking over 120 times in the app. Wow. So yeah, there it's it's ridiculous. What about our conductors? Yeah. So currently night, our artists of the shows, his green circle. They're playing for jobs. Haven't gotten any bites or interviews yet.
But because I've applied, I'm giving myself a pass. It's not a pass. You did the job that you're supposed to do. Like that that was your connection and you did it. So well done. You did what you were fully capable of. Like the other part isn't fully like that's not your realm on there.
Now we just got to we got to make people bite. So we'll get there. Our package cowboy of the show Mike says connection check was able to successfully reorganize my desk and install my replacement graphics card.
Work is continuing to progress along and I got access to my 401k after the last episode was recorded. Kathy, I did my taxes this weekend. I saw 401k. I texted you about a glaring oversight that I made that I will take full blame on.
But I will say a part of the conversation for today is purely based off of my taxes. Excellent. Yes. Yes, I can't wait. And yeah, the fact that it wasn't you didn't tell me even though you moved so long, basically the address wasn't correct.
And yet you didn't tell me that I think that's why I didn't tell you. Yeah. Because I'm guessing the conversation was and the address is correct right and I go well I've been here for over a year. So yes. Yeah, no, you did it actually look. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, cool.
What about our all of the show? The all of the show connection check green check mark. I called the dentist. I put it off for over a year and it literally took four minutes appointment booked for tomorrow. Wow. Not only like that's impressive that you got one so quickly in credible. I love that.
Our identical twin of the show Aaron says green heart. I think I'm in a better place mentally now, but I'm still concerned about the general lean towards AI tooling. I'm continuing to try to be open minded and try out new things, but I also don't want to blindly accept things either.
Okay, Aaron look, mini show right here, positive, positive connection checks all those good things. As someone who was at the forefront working at the biggest company that is concerned about AI. I can tell you now the thing that you're fighting against is that everyone is telling you how to use AI.
And no one's telling you how is AI. I'm kidding. Wow. But no one is allowing the Wikipedia moment to happen. Everyone's trying to force it.
And I say that because like I went to high school right when Wikipedia came out when Wikipedia was the big deal and all the teachers were like, don't check Wikipedia. It's feeding you lies. It's going to do all these bad things. It's going to make you a lazy researcher.
Does that all sound familiar? Because that's what we're being told now. So like over time, we will learn the right ways to do the AI things. We will learn what tools give us the best approach to increasing our job. That does mean that like in the meantime some stupid stuff is going to happen.
Don't let the stupidity of the rest of the world like give you any type of fuzziness. The one thing that I would tell people to be careful with at this current time is us trying to hand jam AI into everything is changing how we are thinking about general things.
And if you don't believe me, Microsoft literally put out a research paper that they did in conjunction with Carnegie Mellon that was basically saying the same thing.
AI is changing how people think like cognitively it is changing how we process information and how we actively act on information as it's coming to us. So my concerns there are you're probably doing fine. Don't feel like you have to get this solved today.
It took people almost a decade to figure out how to use Wikipedia properly. And then we found out that all the stuff they were telling us to research was also wrong. So like whatever on that part, but also allow yourself to ease into using these tools. But more importantly, try not to let it like.
You take the way that you like process information as well. But you can do it, I believe in you. Absolutely. Our tech podcast listener of the show, Pillax says connection check, green check mark did make progress on the mod.
I need to talk to another guy who's developing another thing so I can get tools he is using for his thing. I also learned more rust, but priorities have it that I couldn't keep doing more. Yes, that's okay. You still got the green check mark well done.
Our Oracle of the show, so soft says a green tree. My new gym is lovely and I've been swimming three times. Wow, I want to go more. That's awesome. Yay. Check list enthusiast of the show Mike says previous connection green check mark finish off.
At least one of my personal projects knocked out a project and replaced it with some newer ones, but that's life. Hey, you know what? You did it. Yep. Our soprano of the show Debo says green heart. I did my taxes meet too. That's all I got. Congratulations.
Our fish bear of the show, fishy Kai yellow circle. We've lost some cleaning momentum, but it's still happening well done. And our pathologist of the show Laura says green heart. My connection was to have some slow mornings. Don't overdo it at work and call my mom off to the check end.
I was able to shift things around to have a more slower morning at home. I could have definitely gone easier at work, but did okay. And I talked to my mom every couple of days. I think I did okay. I think you did okay too. Our car of all trades of the show Carl says connection check red X.
I don't know what the little emoji is the blue. Is that the handy accessibility emoji? No, or like it's so tiny. I don't need to zoom in. So little enhanced. It had zoom in ahead. It's like a gate. It's like a ticket checker. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, but green check mark.
I failed to acquire and still do not have valid ID. So travel plans, plane tickets needed to move to summer, but I did write code and I did a lot of prep for upcoming code contest. All right. Can't wait to see how condo it shows up in other projects.
Our code monkey of the show Douglas says I still haven't finished the ceiling in my office, but I managed to finally get a work meeting move so I can start joining the conduit live streams again. Yeah. Yay. We're not making we're not making people be lazy. No, not at all. It's not laziness.
It's definitely productive. It's a well deserved break. Yes. Yes. Our robotics engineer of the show Aiden says connection check green check mark not only did I deal with the spark plugs, but I took the whole car in for a checkup. Are you proud of me, Jay? Yes.
Of course, now they've given me a bunch of other things to deal with, but their time will come well done. At least you now know about them and you can prioritize them in the order of their importance. Yep. And our nameless of the show nameless says red circle, I procrastinated all conduit.
I didn't get any of the calls done or appointments made. Good thing they aren't time sensitive yet. Yeah. I'm glad that we were able to at least acknowledge that that they're not that time sensitive. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's helpful. Super helpful. So, so Kathy. So Jay.
We've talked about how we are, well, at least how you are the busiest, you know, what is it the busiest internet of the unicorns? Yep. Yep. Definitely. That's correct. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.
 One of the things that I wanted to talk about and I sent you kind of a list of things was really tying into the the like absolute sheer business, but then also the I don't want to call it the like the recognition of our busyness like we've done a few episodes in the past where we're like it's stressful but positive like this is this is the stress that's going to bring the joy on later and how that's super great.
We've also had several conversations on saying no and how to prioritize ourselves over different topics, but this this year Kathy as I was doing my taxes. It it felt as if this was the easiest year that I've had in probably four or five years. Well, just rub it in. I'm just kidding. Yes.
And the funny enough, I meant to actually text you that of like, wow, I didn't owe any money on my taxes, but also wow, my tax, I was able to complete them in like less than an hour, which is just. Wow, that is impressive.
And a part of it was in this in this moment of like I am starting to give things over to other people. Yes. Not not an realm of that like I can't I'm definitely not doing that enough, but we've talked a little bit about like I'm in this new management position.
I will I'm still unofficial it'll be official in less than one month's time, but out of the necessity in order to just keep up. This year was was kind of designed in that I would be giving a lot of things up. And it's interesting because it feels like there are some some projects that I've had.
And there are some new projects that I've picked up, but there are some things that I've had that I was just like. I am I am a bad like I can't think of another word other than like steward of of owning this thing.
And I've become a little bit more comfortable talking about that, especially when it talks about things like at work. When it talks about like me as a as a developer software engineer a developer and some of the projects that I maintain.
I I wanted to talk about the idea of saying no, but not out of like it's it's not a tire problem. And for those who don't know tire is an acronym that we use to check what's the pressure on us to help us make decisions. That's our time our intuition our resources and our energy.
And I guess this would probably if it felt anywhere would fall in like the overall of it, but maybe also like the I and the are probably of I've been watching as as I tell people like look.
And ultimately this just isn't that important to me and I don't think it's as important to the company the community like the the whatever. And ultimately I'm going to stop doing this. And if someone else wants to pick it up be my guess. Yeah.
Yeah, I think that's really smart and a powerful choice. And I've I've been seeing that a little bit more and I'm working through how it makes me feel part of this has to do with.
 I don't know if there's any other eldest daughters out there in the audience and now obviously birth order is not you know a direct science but there is definitely kind of an unwritten expectation that the eldest daughter is there to help take care of things it's kind of a habitual you know what's it called like expectation I guess that the eldest daughter is not only going to take care of everything.
But currently they're going to be the ones that are going to organize trips they're going to organize birthday parties birthday events or whatever they're going to be the mediator between the rivaling family members.
Yes, but also there they're they're going to be the ones that are going to take care of parents when they're older just this unwritten expectation that they are available to do the free labor.
And in not so I've been doing my best to set these boundaries partially because I don't have as much availability as other members of my family.
 I like to my siblings are not local but my brother is and he is a retired marine so like he has a lot more free time available i'm not saying that his time is not valuable that he does not have you know responsibilities and that sort of thing i'm just saying there is a level of flexibility that he has that I do not.
I finally did say to my parents hey when you need something will you please ask my brother first don't let me be the very first go to because I was feeling like I was the one that was being asked for everything regardless of like before anyone else was asked and my schedule is is not open.
Yes, I work for myself I work from home but that doesn't mean that I can just drop everything to come you know pick up a package off of a off of a porch yeah.
And yeah like Laura says in the chat i'm also already a caretaker you know between our child and my spouse there there's a lot going on and I have been saying you know no.
You know no to things and having this reminder of this conversation and that has been a whole mental work through that I have had had to kind of deal with this level of guilt almost.
 And yeah it's been it's been interesting i love and again this is a definitely a cheap shout out to becoming a super conductor is that you get to listen to these episodes live because I feel like our chat is is is carrying the carrying the show right now because I yes what what our code monkey of the show said is literally what I was going to say which was.
One of the things that we started doing was instead of it going to one person in particular we had to go to a group chat and and I think that. The the thing that we noticed.
 Between like my like my sister and I like one my sisters in college so there's a lot of like i'm not going to ask her to do certain stuff just because it takes a lot of time and she should be studying or whatever but like there are I want them to know that i'm not saying no because i'm just mean i'm saying i'm saying no because of a reason like oh hey I need you to come and do this that in the third and it's like I can't i'm out of town that week so that way when it's not going to be a lot of time.
That way when it's it's never looked at well why does so and so never do anything to help and it's like well. This is this is the situation but I also do appreciate that no you know cathias you say it no is a complete sentence yeah and. Saying no saying no to people who expect things of you is.
It's tough and I mean I can share an instance this you know yesterday where you know one of the things that I've I've stopped doing nearly as much as I've done in the past is just being a financier of things for our nonprofit.
We had a lot I mean one just don't do that it's not there there like some for legal reasons don't do that but also for like nonprofit reasons don't do that either but.
There was a time where if we if we were trying to do something then usually it came out of my bank account first and then I got reimbursed and yeah.
 You know we're we're affiliated with we're under another nonprofit we don't have a credit card that we can use so like there are just some things where I have to eat those costs if I want the services there like I've just got to eat them and then I'm prepared to you know get reimbursed for them as fast as possible yeah but there were like oh hey so and so we need to buy drinks for some event thing and I'm just like I know.
Like I'm not doing that but yeah even even to the point where it's like hey we're trying to host this event and we didn't plan for the costs and to get reimbursed so what should I do and usually the response was like well how much is it here I'll pay for everything and I'll get reimbursed and now.
 All me saying no has one it comes out is just no complete sentence but only after they I get the specific ask from them because everything else is just a test of how important is this actual thing oh hey we want to do this thing in on Friday okay well how important is it that it's done on Friday well I can't happen in two weeks if you're wanting to do this why don't you finance it and then you can see Korean reimbursement that's perfectly reasonable and they go oh well I thought that you would just cover it no yeah that's where it comes up and and again none of it is none of it it is saying no to say no but it's also saying no because it's it's setting the boundary and setting the expectation and defining it where I think if you just go no I can or I'm sorry or it's like that doesn't that doesn't create a boundary compared to the other one.
 To can someone do thing and the answer is no because that then says oh that person can't do thing yes yeah and and that's definitely like I am I am saying no more often or even more importantly not volunteering to do specific things um that I don't have the time for that I don't have the energy for again going through through the tire method for everything, including things that I in the past have done or wish that I could do or that will be really fun or will benefit something as a whole or support people that I love for certain things and it's been really hard because I am a people pleaser but I am doing my best to recover from that.
And again, it's real difficult, but I am doing my best and that's okay. It's okay that your best does not have to be perfection and to keep reminding myself that. Definitely. And we talked about in a previous episode like saying yes to things that are gonna be stressful and what bringing us joy.
I think as we do these things more and more, we get to measure how much joy is actually achieved from that thing.
That's the thing that I struggle with where it's like, hey, I've, you know, there's an event that I was supposed to be going to later this year in September that falls on my child's birthday.
So then the conversation becomes, well, do I, what do I do here? Do I go? Do I try to also bring my child? That way we can, you know, do something there or do I just decline and say, you know what, not this year. And the end result was I just declined. I just said I'm not going.
And in doing that, it lifted so much other stuff off of my plate where like had I gone to that event, could I have taken, you know, my child to a place that she's never been to before to get a bunch of new experiences that, you know, she hasn't experienced, yes, absolutely.
We could have done all these other things. We could have planned all these other things that just sounds so tiring. When in reality, my kid just wants to spend time with me. Like she just wants to spend time with me, really more her friends.
But I think she also has that connection of if, if my birthday happens and my dad's not here, like that is a big deal. Versus me trying to do so many things and also have so many demands from all of the people at the conference that I would be going to. And it's not that they're not important.
It's not that I don't want to spend time with them.
 It's just again, like, how, if I put all of the joy that I get from going to this event on a scale, and then I put like all of the work that's required to get that joy on the other side of the scale, I don't think they balance out, especially when you compound all of the work that I would have to add on top of that to make my child's birthday that much more memorable to make it worth possibly pulling her out of school, possibly paying for an extra plane ticket and doing all these other things.
And it's just like, oh wow, when you're able to effectively weigh those things on a scale, the things that feel super rewarding and super valuable, sometimes just don't measure up. Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
And it's important to be able to recognize and acknowledge those bits, even if it's really hard. Yeah.
 Well, and kind of the last thing that I wanted to think about just in this topic is, again, for kind of the both of us, and you've been doing this significantly longer than I have in terms of managing people and having kind of, in setting their expectations for them, I'm, I've got some feedback from my team.
Just like, hey, how am I doing? How are things going? Like, give me critical feedback because, you know, you know, they've been at the company longer than I have, and I want them to know that I'm coming in as a people manager, I'm here to serve them, you know, as their manager.
But also make sure that, you know, company expectations and all that stuff are met as well. Blah blah blah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that whole thing.
 But in that, the thing that everyone has said so far has been, there needed to be someone in between our, our previous manager who was busy managing a lot of people who was also busy managing the expectations of the company across, you know, three different disciplines of what each of her team members do.
And basically, you know, what each of her team members do. And basically, it led to this perception of, our boss doesn't have time for us.
 Because like, in reality, she didn't, like, constant travel, constant meetings, like, skipping one-on-ones, like, there was no opportunity for us to actually connect and get those needs addressed, which allowed me to kind of ease into that position and just go, hey, now you only have to meet with me.
I will bring the needs that I can't resolve to your attention and then we can kind of move from there. We can go from there and address those things.
And the thing that I've noticed more as I'm kind of doing two roles in the current process is that the more I get consumed with one role, the less I physically can do the other. And that creates some wonderful opportunities to go.
What is now my responsibility? What is our capacity? And how can we either better prioritize or realign expectations so that needs are being met and needs are being fulfilled?
And sometimes that means like me going to my teammates and saying, hey, the expectation is that we write this much content per month.
I see that y'all have written what y'all are supposed to do. Y'all can either write a piece that I was scheduled to write or I can not approve the travel that you want for the thing. Because I have to do, I've only got this many hours in the week and it's not that I'm holding your reward hostage.
It's just what I'm telling you is that if I do this other work, I'm not going to have time to get to the things that you find super valuable and super important.
So do I need to go to my boss and say, hey, we need to read, we need to read, dress this? Or do you think that you actually have the ability to do another post and can we set that expectation?
Is that a thing that we feel comfortable setting as a team and then get all of those measurements and weigh them and do the whole thing and then decide whether or not it's worth doing or not? Yeah, yeah, I love that.
I think that's an important skill to be able to have.
Being able to manage people is rough and people, a lot of times they don't really, a lot of times people that are in charge of people are there because they've been with the company for a while, not necessarily because they have skill with managing people.
And I think that can be a real harm in a lot of areas because of that fact. And it also means that a lot, often times, the people in charge of making these decisions also don't have necessarily have the skills to be able to know what makes a good man, like people manager or what is needed.
And so it's easier to just be like, well, Bob's doing really good in sales. So we'll put him in charge because that's a job upgrade. That's not what it's called promotion. Yes, promotion is the word that I was looking for.
And it's really unfortunate that not necessarily that these people are getting the job because obviously there's something in what was going on. I'm assuming positive intent here that it wasn't just nepotism or whatever, but there's this idea that, oh yeah, this person, I think we'll do a good job.
But they may not have the skills in place to really manage the people. And it's a difficult thing to be able to recognize and kind of acknowledge that, oh yeah, this is a skill. It can be learned, but it takes a lot of acknowledgement that it needs to be learned.
And you can't just take a YouTube class and boom, you're gonna be a good manager. Although I'd like to add, I just put a link in the show notes called leading with empathy, which is like a Forbes article that I read that I was like, I really like this.
And it's just about acknowledging empathy's value in leadership. I love that.
 Yeah, I definitely, I think empathy is one of the top things that makes even the least, maybe skilled people manager helps them give the skill of managing major props because if you have empathy, you're able to understand where people are coming from and be able to meet them where they are in a way that can help them connect to you as a person and give you a level of trust to be the person in charge.
Yeah. And I think that time that's all the way back to the beginning of just even being able to feel like you can tell family members know. One of the things that this article talks about are like psychological safety audits.
And you know, funny enough when we talk about the whole like businesses will be like, we're a family and I'm like, yo, sometimes family is the most job of time seeing.
Like not even intentionally, just as your job is where you spend most of your awake time as an adult and your family is where you probably spend the most collective time outside of your job from growing up all the way into adulthood and caring for family is a big part of that.
So it's a reasonable to believe that like your psychological development is often driven by just patterns in your family.
 So when you're wanting to make strong decisions, even empathy driven decisions, like stopping taking a slight psychological safety audit here and just being like, is this situation that we're in now designed due to others in the room not feeling as if they are capable of handling the task themselves or are they concerned about the consequences of if they get it wrong?
And or have they just been shielded from making those type of decisions their entire life and they don't actually know what getting it wrong looks like and that drives a level of fear.
I think that there's a lot of these things that, again, I'm not a therapist, I did not graduate with any type of degree on psychology, sociology or psychiatry, but I definitely have understood what it means to feel as if if I get this wrong, I'm afraid of the blowback.
So I'm just going to avoid that completely and over commit. Well, and I mean, I will say I did graduate with a degree in sociology and I could say that that's pretty accurate. I'm not an expert even with that degree, but yeah, I would say that that's a pretty accurate statement.
Well, Kathy, I'm glad we were able to talk about this and I do hope that our April's come with a lot of opportunities to say no to some more things. Let's not let April make for a nasty May. Oh goodness. April showers bring me tears or something. I wasn't saying April showers bring me anxieties.
Yes, there we go. Something like that. Yeah, so that was an awesome topic. Hey, in the in the post show, I would love to tell you how I convinced my entire local friend group to check out a Google spreadsheet. Ooh, I love it. I can't wait. That's going to be super fun.
But before we get to that, Kathy, what is your connection for the next conduit? I am going to do my best for all of the things that I have going on.
In fact, we had to make sure that we started this show on time as much as possible because I will be interviewing a member, a cast member of the Wheel of Time TV show here shortly.
And so I am doing my best and that is going to be my connection and I am real happy and content with that being my connection. I'm not going to try and do too much as much as possible.
I'm going to try to find these moments to live and survive and yeah, in that the easiest way to identify that is I am going to do my best. I love that.
Well, as you know, I was in Florida and I always have to do these travel requests and I'm so used to using lift for everything because lift has better like export controls on getting, like I can generate one report for all of my travel and it just, it makes submitting my travel easy.
Lift was three times as expensive as Uber in Florida. So safe to say I didn't use lift nearly as much. So I have to go one by one on my travel history with Uber and generate these reports because Uber hates me. Oh no. Oh no.
Yeah, and to have, having traveled, you know, for four days back and forth. So that's like eight different trips plus stopping to get food and things like that that I got to figure out. Plus also just the concern of like, it's, I'm used to my process.
Now I got to go outside my process and do things is very, very annoying. But that's going to be my connection is to log my travel because if I don't do it like, I have like two weeks to do it otherwise, I can't get reimbursed for it. So I need to, yeah.
And that's like, it's like a hundred or hundred to $200 worth of like lift and Uber rides. But I want that money. Yes. Yeah, absolutely. They should be giving it to me. So I want it. Yeah, agreed.
What about our conductors? Yeah, our artist of the show Carly is going to take an online course that's offered through the library for free on web design. That's so exciting. I can't wait to hear about it. That's fun.
Our package cowboy Mike says buy Wu-Tank tickets because Wu-Tank, Clan, ain't nothing on their mind because Wu-Tanks for the kids continue saving money for a new Apple Watch and fitness tracker. Ooh, I love that you opened it up to like, or some other fitness tracker.
I would love to hear more about the choices that you make. The, uh, of the show, uh, says, I've called the dentist. Now I need to call the doctor. Only seven months of procrastinating, doing this one so far. Perfect. You're on track to get it done. And then you'll just schedule it for tomorrow.
So, yeah, that's good. Yeah. The identical twin of the show errands says figure out vacation plans. I want to make some, sometime this spring to go see family, but also, what am I going to do in the summer? Um, yeah, I think that sounds super fun. Thank you.
Uh, the tech podcast listener of the show, Pillik says, new connection, work on the Bilatro mod. That's pretty much it. And don't have much going on. Jealous. So jealous. I would love to see some conduit, um, card backs in the Bilatro mod. That's just me though.
Um, the Oracle of the show, Sof says, uh, I haven't had a day without working in a while. So I want to take the whole weekend off before things get busy again. Ooh, that sounds fantastic and wonderful. And yes. Yes. Our checklist enthusiasts of the show, Mike says, finish filing my taxes.
Just got to sign the forms and get it done. Awesome. Get or done. Find those forms, baby. I always have a lot of anxiety when everyone else is talking about getting their taxes done. Because I feel like it doesn't take me a long time to do it.
And I am afraid that I'm just, I've just been doing something wrong my entire life. Yeah. That's the fear, the fear that I have. Why can't they just do it for us? Um, anyway, our soprano of the show, Debo says, plan a post Easter long, get away. That sounds good way Easter's coming soon. Ooh. Nice.
Yeah. Fish bear of the show. Fishy Kai says, for real this time, at least exercise a little bit. Hey, Fishy Kai, if you're listening to this, stand up, jump up and down five times and then sit down. There you go. You did it. Um, our pathologist of the show, Laura, says work the system.
I like to spend the next two weeks experimenting with a couple of planners, a couple of apps, see which I actually use an intentional way as opposed to constantly switching between system without much thought, like I usually do. There you go. I like it. Yeah. Love it.
Our Carl of all trades of the show Carl says, next connection check, near term, reschedule wife, birthday party that illness needed to postpone, little further out, put in time off request to run contests at the start of April and finish up all preparations for this.
The reality is I need to make sure my request was granted. Yeah. Good call. Yeah. Good planning. I'm going to code monkey. The show Douglas says, plan out my yearly theme of simplification. Ooh, I like simplification sounds like a good theme. That's, that's awesome. That's a real good one.
I love that. Um, the robotics engineer of the show, Aiden says next connection, call a different mechanic for a second opinion and make an appointment to get the rest of the work dealt with. You can do it. I feel like now me just telling people to call a mechanic isn't going to be enough.
It's going to be like, call a mechanic and then get the stuff fixed. Yes. Don't just keep calling mechanics. Although second opinion is always a good one. Um, the nameless of the show nameless says, try again. Let's get these things in the calendar before they become time sensitive.
I like that one. That's good. It, if you would like to submit a connection, you can do so. Um, you can do so in the relay discord in the hashtag show follow up channel by starting your message with the conduit emoji and putting your connection after.
Hey, you can also just submit feedback by clicking the link in the show notes or using the submit feedback button at relay.fm slash conduit. You can put your connection in that as well. Um, and visit. I'm a super conductor to become a member today.
You'll get access to the pre-impotio banter as well as an ad free episode and access to the co-working session in the off weeks with usually Kathy and sometimes J. When? Yeah.
And I remember to show up even after I've set an alarm to show up and I just go, oh, what alarm? What's that for? Yeah, let's call out. Let's call out the point that like the last step was the last co-working. It's the last two. I just completely skipped one. I just don't even know what happened.
I was like, you know what? He's an adult. He can set his expectations and then he just didn't show up. And so last week, I was like, hey, Jay, just making sure you're going to join the co-working. Oh, yeah, no problem. I've got multiple of those. I do not sell my head.
That's how I heard you in my head. And then showed up late because yes, he said the alarms, but did not actually listen to the alarm. So, you know, it's fine.
Literally the alarm went off and I just like snoozed it, went about my day and then like 10 minutes later, I was like, oh crap, that was not going to a co-working alarm. Did you not like put the name of the alarm? No, I just said no, I just said an alarm per. Oh my goodness.
Okay, at this point, when that happens in the future, you have to say, hey, Dinguis, remind me in 10 minutes to go to the co-working. Yeah. Like, like finish it out. Yeah. Do you remember that one alarm, like do the DUE like task app where you could put a thing and it was constant? Yeah.
I'm going to just set it for like 20 minutes before and just let it book me. So I don't forget. Or I could say, okay, the person, the developer who made the P app, can you make a co-working app that does the exact same thing? Because I look at that thing and I'm just like, I know it's been three.
I know it's been four. I know it's been five hours. Come on. Give me a break. But yeah, you get access to all of that. Lastly, hey, we got a picture of a baby in a Yukon Wearer.com conduit. Yeah. We did.
Shout out to a friend of the show, Rob from amazing things such as Ruminate that also check out the live listening podcast that I do with Rob, which you can't because it's literally me just messaging him on Discord as I'm listening to the episode.
I told Rob, we've got to start a live listening podcast where I just record my thoughts as I'm listening. That is an option. It's a troll. It's like an April Fool's joke. Ooh. Ooh. Oh, no. Oh, no. I got a message, Rob. Anyway, if you want some cool conduit merch, go to Yukon Wearer.
