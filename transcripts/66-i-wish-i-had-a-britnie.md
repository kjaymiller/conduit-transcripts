From Relay FM, you're listening to Conduot, the show we Condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduot, the show that knows those around the Golden Globes.
This episode is brought to you by someone because I don't have the document up anymore what happened one second one second. I'm doing it. I'm doing it. Oh, this episode is brought to you by Backburner and Micro.Blog.
I'm Jay and with me is the unicorn of the internet, the one the only Kathy Campbell. Happy New Year. Happy New Year Jay. I can't believe this is our first episode of the New Year. Yes, the year of joy has officially begun.
Will it be a joyful experience? Who knows? But what happened this week in the discord? Oh, it was a heck of a week and this week's update, it was brought to you from Aaron Reilsie and Katie. Justin created an incredible movie poster, imagining Relay FM switch on as a romantic comedy.
Just 10 out of 10. Incredible. The hashtag keyboards channel helped me change the switches in my keyboard, which I am currently using right now. I've got my icky board with tomorrow switches and some pastel keycaps. They also then. Any of that means it's fine. I'm not talking to you right now.
They also helped me find some new keycaps that are coming that are very cute. I'm very excited for them to come. Is this where you do the, like, I'm going to type really close to the microphone now to let people hear the buttery speakers? I can't. Do you want to hear? Let's see. Here we go.
Hold on. Hold on. Ready? I heard nothing. Okay. Zoom has to start. Yeah. That's my, yeah. The noise canceling stuff. But, you know, that's the chaos that people come for.
 There was also a whole lot of book reading and talking about books and then lots of encouragement because folks, there's several folks that are on a job hunt and we're getting to support them as they go through that, which is an emotional, it's an emotional journey for a lot of us, especially because, like, these are my friends.
And if they don't get the job, I'm very sad for them. And so I'm here to support them and hopefully get it. Hopefully we'll get some good news soon. Yeah. Well, thank you for that. And thank you to our executive producers, Aaron, Ralezy and Katie.
We also, in the off-week, did our last week in co-working. I'm, by the way, for, there are folks who are listening to this for the first time. I know because it's a new year, people have goals, people are in the gym right now.
We've got like another two weeks of that before they get, I mean, before they continue their ambitious challenges there. So we're kind of explaining a little bit more of the stuff that's happening.
So in the off-weeks, we do a co-working session with folks who are superconductors or members of Relay FM switch on. Specifically for conduit. Specifically for conduit, yes.
You have to become a Relay FM switch on member and then choose the conduit perk like your money goes to conduit and the conduit member, the conduit hosts which are Kathy and I. So during that co-working session the last week, we kind of just got back into the swing of things.
We are superconductor friends started the new year off slowly. I think everyone was exhausted. But we did show up for one another and did our best to try to get some work done. Kathy did also help me with keyboard stuff as my keyboard isn't in yet so there won't be any ASMR goodness on that.
But hopefully it'll be here by the next conduit and I'll talk about my moon lander, Ergo Littie. Was it ergonomic, ortho linear keyboard or whatever with a... Something like that. I don't know. I had an office expense and I needed to spend it.
So yeah, thank you for the help in that and also helping to start the year off in the right way. If any of those things sound like fun hanging out in our discord, talking about keyboards, fountain pins or maybe just taking a break in our break room, visit I'm a superconductor.
com and become a member today. You'll get access to the pre-show and the post show where we also talked about our kids growing up and how we're not old. We're just nostalgic. But also in this episode's post show, that's right, you get a pre and a post show.
We're going to be playing a rather enlightening game of would you rather... So no, would you rather turn left or turn right? We'll find out. It probably also depends on where you live and what side of the road you drive on. But I think we also have some shout outs. At least I have one.
Kathy, did you have one? I was going to just steal yours. Oh, okay. Go ahead, steal away then. All right.
So big shout out to our Canadian trivia card enthusiast of the show, Erica Ensign, who was a master of scheduling and got both of my relay FM switch on co-hosts together to play a game of random pursuit. Jay joined me as did Alex Cox.
And when I say that it was an epic game of madness and delight, that is putting it mildly. No spoilers, but if you have not ever listened to a random pursuit game over on the incomparable, this is going to be a fun one. And we will post a link when it goes live right now.
It's just available for members for the live show, members of the incomparable. But when it goes live, we will definitely post about it. Yeah. Wow. We have a lot of stuff happening. So yeah, it's busy here. Let's take a break and talk about our first sponsor, which is Backburner.

And I basically, it's been so nice to just kind of scroll through and be like, okay, what do I want? What sounds good? Yes, this, this perfect. Now, can I do that all in my head? Absolutely. I know what we normally like.
But being able to see it and read it in words, like in written words is so much easier for my brain to be able to like manage it. So I really enjoy. I've been doing something similar where I've been using Backburner to keep hold of my chores.
Just kind of the the weekly chore list that I wind up doing throughout the week. So I can vacuum. And I'm actually looking at Backburner now. And I'm swiping left, which is just going to cue them up later for me.
So I have like vacuum, clean my bathroom, you know, clean my daughter's room, do the dishes. These are these are things that they just keep popping up. And like I now have a quick checklist that I can run through.
Hey, checklist, it sounds like I think we're going to be talking a little bit more about that later. Oh, okay. So it's really cool that I don't have to think in a term of like full dread and anxiety because I have this long list that I'm staring at.

How did you do since our last episode? You're not asking me to zap. What is this? What is this new year where I'm not zapping for you? Is that a thing? Did we decide not to zap? Do you want to zap? I do want to zap. Okay. Our third host of the show, Javier, thank you.
And now it's time for our connection check. That doesn't zap. Thank you. So all that stuff I said before, how'd you do? I was great. It worked out really well. So for anyone that doesn't know, connections are a way to kind of hold accountability for each other.
And so we make a connection for each conduit, which is a free app. And so we make a connection for each conduit, which is a for tonightly period of time. And my connection last episode was to make the appointments I need to make. And by golly, I did, I made each phone calls to make 12 appointments.
It's, yeah, a lot. It's going to be an expensive few months because we. Got vet appointments. We've got dentist appointments. I appointments, a variety of other things, just like lots of appointments and a big green check mark because I did them all. That's, that's wild.
I think also I would love to highlight in this that connections are what you make of them. Yes. We don't do smart tasks or SMA RT tasks. We're not trying to put a lot of pressure on these. I believe there have been a few times where our connections have been survived. Yes.
And mine was one similar one that when I when I'm starting to feel some anxiety, I go back to, which is do one thing less. And I take that however it is. You know, I was talking earlier about the keyboard that I had to do, office claiming and things on.
Kathy, what would you believe if I told you that they rejected my claim? What? Yeah. So imagine the anxiety and peril of overspending on a nice fancy keyboard only to be stuck with the bill.
And there was this, the situation of panic and stress and like, okay, I need to talk to whoever I need to talk to to get this resolved. And I was like, you know what? That requires me to go and like open up my work computer, which is going to require me to like check my email.
It's going to require me to do all this other stuff. I'm going to get really distracted. How about I just wait until the next time I actually need to be in my office to do these things? Yeah. So that was that was my one less thing.
I I didn't check my work email over the entire break except for like the first day that I was on vacation just to make sure that my my out of office was set.
And I I was able to do that and I was able to push off, you know, doing this little extra thing, which in the end got resolved and now they're taking care of it and everything is fine. Thank goodness. Yes.
But I want to kind of share a little trick that a friend of mine taught me, which was over the holiday break put in your out of office that you will be marking all messages as red.
So they need to follow up with you after the holidays are over if they are expecting some type of correspondence because that forces the priority situations to come back. And it allows you like they don't have to write the entire email again.
 They just have to follow up and because you marked it as red, you know, you've archived everything, you can go back and search for the context, but you don't have to look at that sea of email when you get back the hundred to hundred emails that you have and immediately be like, I got to start digging through these.
It was like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I've already explained to everybody. Step one, Mark, all is red. Okay. Now as they come back, okay, from this person, do a quick read. All right. Cool. Awesome. Thanks, groovy.
Obviously, if your job depends on things that are coming in through email, you know, for you to actually do your job, this becomes one of those, those productivity tasks that just won't work.
But what I, what I will say is if, if you're just anxious and you can't take a break or a vacation because you're already dreading the massive amount of email that it's not even all important. It's just, you gotta sift through it. That's a really good trick.
And it worked so well for me, except for the fact that I went back to work a day early which was, no, no, no, no, no, I just forgot what day I was supposed to go back to work. So, that's amazing.
So yeah, one of my coworkers is like, wow, you're back early and I was like, huh? That's how you know you've had a great break because you're like, yeah, let's go. Oh my goodness, amazing. So wow, we're starting the year off strong to green checkmarks.
So for those listening to the show, we also have a community of conductors, both free and members and they also tell us how they did in the last conduit. So, Kathy, we've been, we've been dallying on this. Let's, let's lightening around these conductor connections. Yeah, let's go.
Our artist of the show, Carly says, connection check, green circle. I forgot to post this last week because of the holidays, but I did prepare for the holiday market. No one bought anything, but I did succeed because I was there. Yes, this is the energy that we are bringing to conduit.
You conduit, even if the definition of whatever it is changes, we are here to support you and love on you and give you that you conduit energy that you might need. Our tire advocate of the show, Chin Toss says connection check, green heart, accidentally had four weeks for this one. That's okay.
I spent quality time with both my kids over the Christmas break and enjoyed good time with the extended family. Hey, that's, that's what holiday breaks are for. Family not getting sick, not getting sick and not getting sick. Yes.
But I'm glad that you were able to have fun and do it in a way that you didn't get sick. Yes. Our identical twin of the show, Aaron says connection check, green circle, new enemy type is mostly implemented.
I do need to do some tweaks on it still, but I should get it more 100% by the time conduit records. Aaron, I want your update. We want to know. We want to know. I want to see the jar, the secret enemy, the jar, the discord jar.
The Canadian trivia card enthusiast of the show, Erica says connection check, yellow heart. I did get a shelf organized, but I didn't get a shelf organized. Want, want, but I did at least clear one out, which played a big role in a trip to donate seven bags of clothing and linen. Wow. That's wild.
That's a lot of stuff. Wow. Oh my goodness. Good job. Well done. All right. Our soprano of the show, Debo, connection check, green heart. Forgot to update last time, but my connection was mostly to just relax. And I was able to do that. Yes. We love that for you.
Our shark of the show says connection check was to get out of the off or to get the office cleaned. Wow. I'm just seeing words pop up. You're doing great. Yeah. My connection was to get my office cleaned before we had guests come after the first of the year.
Green check mark, even though the guest did not come and standing desk is not here, I got the office clean as best as possible. And I focus on the things that are in my control and didn't worry about the rest. I still have some organization to do, but that'll be for another conduit.
Hey, I feel like I might know what the next connection will be. And if not, I'll know what the connection after that will be or the connection after that. Our pathologist of the show, Laura says connection check, green Christmas tree.
Thoroughly enjoyed my vacation and did a pretty good job last week, easing back into the real world. I noticed I was significantly more tired at the end of my work days, though. So clearly adjustments are still in progress.
This week has been derailed by a sick kiddo, but successfully keeping expectations realistic. Yes, we love that for you. And this is why I harp on that and not getting sick part. Yes. Our fish bear at the show, fishy, fishy guy says, yellow heart.
The kids got back to school as smoothly as possible, I guess everyone has been at least a little sick in the last two weeks. And some of us have been very sick, which for your range priorities. All right. Well, fishy guy, just get better, please. Yes, please.
Our panda of the show, James says connection check, green check. I eventually managed to escape from my COVID quarantine and like an excited panda making a break for freedom at the zoo. So you just kind of like rolled like pandas don't escape.
They don't like they just kind of want to love on everybody. So maybe that that must be I must be what it is not when you're sick. You please don't love on everyone while you're sick. Yes, I'm feeling much better now with just a touch of fatigue remaining still had my delayed Christmas dinner.
Some many lovely people and generally assuming I am now immune to all diseases forever. Oh, no. I hate to tell you this James. That's not how it works. Nope. Yeah, we're going to just continue on though and not tell them the truth.
Our training enthusiast of the show, Reilsie says connection check, green heart. I tried to do a lingo again, but just heard that they fired a ton of people to replace their translators with AI. I ain't having that. Got a pack, a weekend trip to visit a friend.
Reilsie, we'll have to chat because I do think that I heard of a couple of replacement applications. The sad thing is I don't think that the problem is going to be isolated to just do a lingo.
And I did find out that the people that were fired were some of their contractors, which I know it doesn't make it better.
But I think at least contractors, I feel like there's kind of like a structure in place that kind of helps them out a little bit more versus folks who are immediately being let go and not having any type of preparation for it. Situations still sucks across the board though. Absolutely.
But I think they seem to be handling it surprisingly well within reason. Or what should I call it? Their messaging seems to be like at least better than say some podcast apps that may have completely disappeared from the internet and then came back and they're like, it makes for your patience.
But you know, what do I know? Moving on our mountain dweller of the show, Logan. Logan says connection check green check mark. I met with my boss and came up with some good plans for 2024. Yes. This is our year. The doppelganger. The doppelganger. Yes. Oh, no.
I also met with the boss and made plans for 2024. How you did? Oh, no. So the jury is still out folks if the mountain dweller of the show is secretly just me. The nameless of the show nameless says green circle. I got the discord server up. Yay.
I haven't launched it for the whole youth group yet, but I now have a place for all the team conversations to live in the server so far, so good. Congratulations. Yes. Our large fry of the show, Justin says connection check red ex kids got sick after the holidays.
Life got a little wild, so I don't even remember my last connection. We'll make a new one. I mean, to me, that sounds like surviving the holidays was your connection and you get a great big green check mark for that. So we're going to push that in there for you. Nicely, of course.
People get sick and are Oracle of the show. So says connection check. I have no idea what my last connection was as I'm trying to deal with life post COVID, but here I am just setting a new one because Kathy said I could. Yeah, that's when you make the rules, it's going to do what you want.
So absolutely. Yeah. And welcome back and happy new year. Kathy, today's topic is one that you thought about and then we got some kind of support from that topic as well from our discord community. And that was trying to maintain and track all of the things that have to happen in the year.
New year, new you, same old problems. There's a lot of stuff that comes in.
 It's wintertime in the US, which means that, you know, if you did all the, if you neglected to do all the things, your pipes are burst in and you got to get inspections and you got to get the snow tires put on if you live in that part of the world or the country or the, yeah, the world that works to how, how are you keeping up with all of this stuff?
Not very well.
Please witness last conduits checklist of things to call because I hadn't done it in a very long time. I'm, I'm trying to figure out the best way to keep track of these things up until now I've kind of been just kind of like being very reactionary.
So when the little light in my car comes and says, Hey, it's time to do something. I'm like, Oh, I need to do something. If I run out of cat food because the prescription expired because our cat is a pretty, pretty prince.
He needs special food that basically is micro dosing antidepressants because he has seasonal depression. Just your cat has seasonal depression. Yes, yes, I do. Okay. So we learned this.
It's been, it's been like four, five years now since we figured this out, but what would happen is every January for about three years in a row, he would start peeing like on our beds on any clothes that he saw any of this. Because we had like the holidays were over.
And so we were like, this is weird. And so yeah, that's what the doctors say. But the problem is is that we need a prescription for it. And it is on a normal, like it is on an automatic delivery, which is great.
But that was why one of the appointments I needed was for the cat to go and say, yep, he's still depressed. So yeah, I don't even know how that conversation begins. Like I need to get a satellite for my. I just thought that's what cats did. I thought they were just little.
But the good news is, is I no longer have to worry about, like, immediately getting my clothes into like drawers or hanging up or something. I also don't need to have like waterproof comforters on my bed because he decides to pee. So you know, that's a win-win for all of us. That's. Yeah.
Well, I'm. I'm just in shock. You're welcome. Show title. It's a light for cats. But yeah, so this. Okay, so this, this was a hard one for me because when someone, when, when I think it was Ralezy mentioned, the, you know, it's tax season in the US and, you know, Kathy, I know that you do. Yeah.
My woes are nothing compared to Kathy's woes. Good lord. For anyone that doesn't know, one of my clients as a unicorn is a CPA, which means tax season is my busy season. We do like have a very good system in place. And so like it, it's not horrendous.
However, we are going through some changes this year because always we always got to do changes. And so just like the, the pre stress, it is pretty heavy. But you know, it's fine. Yeah. That.
So one of the things that you also do is you are one of the folks that make sure that all of the relay FM switch on hosts get paid. Yes. And you also have to verify their tax information. Yes. Which, let me tell you, I love all of the hosts. Communication. Not always great.
So when we were, when we were talking about a topic, the one thing that I thought about was like, this year was so much easier for me in terms of like the tax prep side in terms of like relay FM, which is funny because we did better this year than we did last year.
But because I had a tool that I use called solver, which basically creates a list of calculations, like it's like a calculator, but it's also like a list. And the last time that we did this, I had that list.
So I remembered how I got that list to begin with, which was like, you know, I just go and I go into the bank app and I go, oh, I did the thing, then you do the math with the thing and then you look from this time to this time and this time to this time. But I had all of that documented.
And it made me think of something somewhat historical. Are you familiar with the ship manifest? Yes. So because I have watched the fantastic film Master in Commander, which is basically conversations about manifests. Interesting. A lot of other stuff. Anyways, continue on.
So for those that don't know, I served in the US Marine Corps. I was deployed on naval vessels for about three years of that time. And manifests are the things of like saving lives.
There are so many manifests between what people are on the ship, who's supposed to be on the ship, what contents are supposed to be on the ship.
It's often used when we're going from one country to another to know what we're supposed to have and not supposed to have on the ship, especially when you're going to places that have really like stringent, like fruit and vegetable laws for invasive species and things like that.
So I was immediately thinking about to me, it wasn't necessarily that I, like, there's this book called the checklist manifesto. And in my mind, I was like, I kind of want the manifest manifesto because the thing that helps me isn't necessarily a checklist of what I need to do.
It's a checklist of what I've done. And this ties a lot into my actual productivity system, which we didn't give it a name last time. So I've been using, I finally got to use it. And I've been using it every day. My new Hobinichi Tacho, which has been really, really nice to use.
And I am an archivist when it comes to productivity. I have a digital task manager that says, like, do these things. But I more importantly keep track of the things that I did because he gives me the ability to go back to it and go, oh, it's tax season again.
What did I do? So last year, all the emails that I gathered, I did at the time when I was filing my taxes. And I put them in a folder called taxes for 2023. So now, this year, when I have to go do that all again for our tax planner, I can think of all the stuff that I need to do.
But then I can go back and look at my manifest. I can look at my tax planning manifest from last year and say, here are all the things that I did. Because I'm always worried I will forget something if I try to sit down and make a list.
But if I wrote down the things that I did, especially as I'm doing them, it gives me the ability to have something to check against instead of being like, did I do the thing? Oh, no, because I didn't realize that was a thing that I needed to do.
So I didn't write it down versus, oh, I learned the hard way the last time. Let me write that down so I don't forget about it. Yeah, I think my biggest thing right now is trying to figure out where to put those things. Because I am very good at planning stuff for other people, but now for myself.
So like today, I worked on creating something called SOPs, which is standard operating procedures for a new client working through. So we can do the checkmarks checklist to make sure that they do everything that they need to.
But I need somebody to do that for me because otherwise, I'm just like, okay, yep, this is totally, totally doing this. Yes, Laura. Okay. In the chat. So in case you are listening to this in your podcast app of choice, hi. Hello, we record this live on Tuesdays the week that this comes out.
And right now, Laura is in the discord and says that she will set up my planning system. And I will set up hers. I think that sounds like a great plan. And then I will ignore it because that's how my brain does.
But maybe if we push each other, basically get accountability, uh, uh, buddies, uh, that's kind of what the podcast is here. Yeah. We are in the discord. We're your biweekly accountability check. Yes. Yes. So the question of like, where do I put these things? I will be honest.
I just put them where they are and leave it there. People, what does that mean? Okay. So like a good example. How do you know when it's time to get your oil changed in your car? I don't. The last time you went and got your oil changed, it didn't put the little sticker in the window.
Oh, no, they do. But see. Do you literally pull off the sticker on the window? No, no, listen, listen, I may or may not wait so long. That's the sound that fleaches out the sticker so that I don't know.
It's like, the little book thingy that I have in my, um, glove compartment says that it's like that I don't need to do it as often as they say, which is great because it's almost like a hundred dollars.
But like, I, uh, there, there's also like, it depends on what they put in your car because if they use different oil, then what the manufacturer is saying to use, it changes that. So you should listen to what the last person did.
But why, why am I going to trust somebody that I like charges, you know, 1999 for an oil change as opposed to the people that built the car? That's why you should listen to them because they might not be putting in what they would ex what the manufacturer is expecting them to put in.
Well, then they're doing it wrong because I'm telling them what to do, but you paid them to do it. I know. So they should be doing what I'm telling them to pay for it. I'm like, do doing, wait, they should be doing what I paid them to do. Yeah.
All of this to say, all, if, if there's a thing that I'm worried about that I need to go do the thing, I will put it where I will be reminded for my car, my oil change and all that.
Like you, my car does tell, well, my car will just look at the mileage and the last time it was reset and say, hey, it's probably time for an oil change based on either the date and or that.
But also I use the little sticker in the car and then I make a calendar appointment that says, hey, go do that thing. But I will also say that like for me with my taxes, I don't have a separate place where I put all of my emails for my taxes.
I just label them with tax and the year and then they, they sit in place so that when I'm looking for them, I just go and I search for tax in the year and then I get a list of all those things.
So when I see, oh, electric bills because, you know, when you get paid and you use your house or a part of your house as an office, taxes become weird. But one of the nice things is you get to write off things like your electric bill and your water bill and all those things.
So like, for the record, I am not a tax professional. Yeah, talk to a tax professional before you decide to start a podcast just so that you can commit tax fraud.
So like doing all of these things are one of those like, it's one of those things like the more and more that I have tried to create systems, the less I've seen them be successful and trying to move things. So instead of moving them, I try to keep them where they are as much as possible.
And even with like my new toy, which was a 3D printer, one of the things that I've tried to do is just make containers to put things where they are in a thing. So the being in a thing is important.
So when you have a bunch of papers that you got a process, leave them by the door, which was where you got them. You got them. You brought them into the house. Right. So as you're leaving, you can see them, put them in a thing. But you're just a thing with that. That's how I've tried that.
And right now, I just have a table by the front door that's covered in all of the things.
You have a bunch of, so you have a table that's full of a bunch of things that you put things inside of? Like, there's no, I'm going to, after this, after the show, I'm going to send you a picture of my friend thing. It's clearly, yeah. Yes, Laura, I agree.
So she says that Jay is describing how her husband dude does these things. I can't function like that. Yes, because my, like, yes, exactly the male graveyard. Yep. Yep. Male graveyard. No, that's a different thing. It's called the trash. The things that you actually have to action on. I do.
And I put the trash things in the trash and the important things in the important place. Or like, you have to go through it. And that's a problem because if you put it down, it then disappears into the male graveyard. Yeah. And you lose it. Even listen, I've tried the fancy boxes.
I've tried like a things against the wall. Yeah, I think Jay is well-medicated or at least his ADD, ADHD does not manifest in similar ways. So I hyper focus and I get permission to hyper focus. So I only check the male like twice a week. But when I check it, it's a process.
It's like, okay, I'm going to check the male. I'm going to process everything that's in the mailbox. I'm going to stand by the trash can and the shredder and be like, shred, trash, shred, trash, keep, shred, trash, keep. And then I take the keep pile and I put it back by the door.
So it's like, I'm trying to use all of the superpowers that come with having ADHD to their advantage. But they think, but I'm just like you, if I don't do that, that document is gone forever. So I have a question for you.
So when you put it back by the door, the stuff that you're keeping, what, how, when, what what happens to the keep the key just magically disappear at some point because Britney's gone in and done stuff with it.
Okay, see, I don't have a Britney, but I also don't have a Britney that can magically come up behind me and do the things with the keep. Well, it's not even that she does a thing with the keep. It's a, I have processed them.
And if I know that there are deadlines for things also, I, I auto pay everything. So yeah, no, I totally. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the stuff, usually the stuff that, like the keep pile is very, very limited. It's often like car registration and like, right, which still has to be managed.
Yeah, I put that. Listen, I'm just calling out the privilege as I see it. I put it in the family calendar that says, Hey, deadline to pay this thing, which is usually like two or three weeks before the actual deadline. And then I go, Oh crap, we got to pay the thing.
And then we go pay the thing and I go, wait, where's the thing? Oh, yeah, that's right. It was mail. So it's in the mail pile. And that just dig through the mail pile, but the mail pile is never that big. It's all, it's only like 10, 15 items. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
I don't, but and I get what you're saying of that like obviously this is why we do our systems checks because none of this stuff is ever like a permanent thing. It just while it's working, I'm like, yeah, I'm going to milk it for everything that I can.
Like right now I'm 3D printing a bunch of cables and then not a bunch of cables, a bunch of cable organizers and then putting those inside of my travel bag and then buying extra cables that way, like I don't ever have to take those cables out of the bag.
I think Casey Liss wrote a blog post about this one time. And it's one of those things where like now that I have a 3D printer, it's a lot easier to do that because everything can be organized nice and neat. I mean, again, don't spend hundreds of dollars on organization like use corks and stuff.
Use what you can to make it work to like do that. But the fact that I never have to guess where something is because I have a manifest that goes like right there, like to me, that bag is the manifest. Everything that's in the bag is always the thing that's in the bag. Stuff that's in the bag.
The only time it ever goes out of the bag is like when I'm at the hotel and then it goes into another container that is also in the bag so that when I leave, I pick that container up and put it in the other bag. So the manifest is always intact.
The things are the things are always together and I never have to document or figure out like, oh, I need to go do this. It's like, hmm, what's in here? Well, that's what's supposed to be in here.
And then if it's not in there, then I immediately fix it and then I don't have to think about it anymore. I mean, I definitely do that for things like cables and plugs and whatnot for the next like stuff.
Like I have my bag of stuff that I take, you know, when I'm traveling or whatever, like getting that all sorted out and making sure that that all, you know, works. But it's harder for things that are not special events and that's where I wish I had a company. Yeah.
And I will also say that like, this is a very privileged way of being organized and being on top of things.
 Like the fact that I have a special bag that always has the cables that I need in it and those cables never leave that bag, that's like, yes, I have a camera bag that's like that and I have like my backpack travel kit and then in my long time, like actual suitcase travel kit and, you know, luckily, no, that stuff expires.
But it is so much easier to do that when you have the ability to do those things. So yes. Yeah. I totally get like I have a lot of privilege in that sense too, but I wish I had a Brittany. But you know, listen, I'm opening up.
I may be currently married, but I open up applications for a housewife for Brittany or Brittany. Doesn't need to be named Brittany. Can be anything. No, has to be a Brittany. Okay. If you want this for all you have to change your name. Okay.
But of course, we're going to my Brittany is going to be spelled differently so that we keep it, you know, we can keep track of which Brittany is which and mine will. So be ready to be called it's Brittany bitch. You stole it. Thank you. You stole it. You stole it. It's so mad at you right now.
You stole my joke. You're welcome. What can the sea accept your welcome? James, but you live in Scotland. I need a Brittany here on that note. What are what is your connection for this week? Hopefully it's to go get your oil changed in your car. So you don't.

And I rented a hotel room and we're having friends stay the weekend with snacks. We're going to watch Mean Girls. We're going to get pizza. I just need to survive having teenagers for that long. But yes, apparently also get the oil changed my car. Yes. Yes, please.
Jay before you go on this trip because that's not a great time to realize. That it needs to be. We're staying like 15 minutes away. I think it's okay. I think we'll drive fine. And so just walk there. So my connection will be to be brave. I have to do some things that I'm afraid of.
And I will be brave. And I will explain more in detail in the future. Everything is okay. I am fine. But I have some moment of bravery that is required of me in the next conduit. So yes, by the time you're hearing the next episode, I will have either been brave or not been brave.
But either way, I've got to deal with it. You're going to be brave. You're going to be brave because we're here to support you. That Cathy reminds me that inside of every human being, there's this other thing we call him Brad. Not Brad from the Panatic.
I can't channel him, even though I can't text him. But I have to summon Brad and let Brad be brave for me when I can't be brave for myself. So yeah. Brad is your Sasha fierce. Got it. I mean, I'm sorry. I was going to say I don't listen to Taylor Swift. It's a beyond same reference. I know.
Oh my gosh. I know. I got the reference. Okay. I'm just making sure. I just like just like angering everyone. It's fine. It's like when I have a supportive community here. Jay. It's like supportive. It's like when I intentionally get star trek and star wars confused. Like I know what I'm saying.
Yeah. I know I know that Kirk can use the force. It's fine. Yeah. You'll let me like that. What about our conductors? How do they do? Or what I hate on pandas? No, that's just that's just pure hatred for the worst animal on the planet. There's there's no. Wow. There's the sugar coating that one.
Wow. Moving on for our supportive community, our artists of the show Carly, new connection. I need to get back to the job hunting. So I'm going to set a connection to apply to at least one job a day for the next two weeks. Weekdays only.

I have some restrictive restrictions to work with thanks to where I work. This conduit's connection is to bite the bullet and give omnifocus a try. I can kind of access the web app for my work computer.
If that doesn't work, I may just have to contempt myself with either not having any access to my work tasks responsibilities list. If I'm not physically at work, my brain dislikes this or attempting to go full physical system with work tasks. That's tough.
Our fish bear of the show, fishy guys said, oh, no, actually, Kathy, can you read this one? Yeah. Okay. Our fish bear of the show, fishy guy, forget yearly. Oh, you've. Forget yearly sheet themes. That future is too far away.

I can send you a link in the discord. Is it like a scrub daddy system and scrub mama? I mean, you could use a scrub daddy scrub mama, you know, whatever. Um, but the, the, it basically is like, here's a day to do this, a day to do that.
