From Relay F.O., you're listening to Conduit. The show we Condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit. I'm Jay. And I'm Kathy. And you're like, Jay, didn't you host the last one? I was like, hey, what? There's no such thing as host, sweetly share.
But I'm going to let you know, this is this is Kathy's show. And I'm here to help get us to to win where the, you know the words, I'm here to get us to where the unicorn magic is going to happen. But before we get there, we've got a lot of stuff to do. First and foremost, let's talk about St.
Jude folks is September. And that means it is childhood cancer awareness month. And Relay F.M. is once again for the third year doing the Relay F.M. for St. Jude Drive, where we are helping to find cures and save children, which is the mission of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.
Because of generous donors, families never receive a bill from St. Jude for treatment, travel, or food, because a family should just have to worry about helping their child live.
For context, it cost all over $200,000 for one child with a cute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common form of childhood cancer. And today, I'm happy to say that Relay F.M. this year alone has covered that cost for that one child completely just in donations.
We have gotten over $202,000 donated currently, but we're not done yet. In the last three years, Relay F.M. has raised over a million dollars, a million dollars. That is a lot of dollars. And it's only September 7th. And we've been doing this for a little over a week for this year.
And we've already made more than $200,000 raised it because of the generous donations from you. And we're so thankful for everyone that has donated, however much they have donated, however much they have shared, to give to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital has just been incredible.
And I'm here to say that you should definitely donate. Do that. Donate. Donate today. Donate tomorrow. If you want to donate for both, donate for both. That's fine. Any amount is appreciated. I will tell you though. If stickers are a thing that get you excited, which you know me, I like stickers.
One of my conduit connections was to buy stickers. So if stickers are your thing, if you make a gift of $100 or more, you will get an exclusive relay FM stickers of thanks pack at the end of the campaign. Also, if your company does any type of matching, be sure to reach out to Steven Hackett.
And we'll have to figure out how that all works. Steven at relay.fm with the information for your corporate matching. And we can get that added to our relay total. Absolutely. I know my company does matching. So I plan on doing that as well. I'm also going to be making two donations this year.
One for my family. And one, as I mentioned in the previous episode, we have a family friend who was recently at St. Jude with their child. And I'm sad to say that unfortunately their child did not make it. And it totally happens. And I understand. It's hard to think about.
But one in five children still do not survive from childhood cancer. And St. Jude will not stop until that is no longer the case. So again, to those that have donated, know that you have helped my friends directly. And to those that need any reason to donate, just know that St.
Jude is on a mission. They're not going to stop until no child dies from cancer. But we are here to help with that. And last but not least, there is going to be a podcast. The thon on September 17th. Do you want to do the whole St. Jude thing? Cause I want to talk. I want to talk about St.
Jude's do. Okay. Kathy, you talk about St. Jude's too. Because I'm super excited for the podcast. The thon September 17th from 12 p.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time. Yes, that's eight hours this year. Visit twitch.tv slash relay FM and join some of your favorite people on a video.
There's going to be so many shenanigans. I cannot even tell you so many great surprises and things coming eight hours of amazingness going to happen live on the on twitch and tune in to help us support St. Jude and help us hit those fundraising goals.
Who knows what will happen during those eight hours. So many things. So many things will happen. And you can go to st. Jude.org slash relay to find out what those milestones are. We've hit so many just in this past week. Poor Mike and Steven are super busy. But they love it. We love it.
We're so excited. Let's cure childhood cancer together. Okay. So since I did way too much talking on that message, I'm going to just jump into the next part, which is of course, ZAP. Our connection checks. And I have to start this by passing it over to Kathy to give us follow up. Oh my goodness.
Yeah. So we had in the discord chat such so many amazing conversations were super excited. My favorite book drag and Skyler. Sorry. My favorite blue dragon Skyler wanted to do a follow up on wind downs and startups. They have had a reoccurring project in omnifocus for a long time.
That's just a long list of simple tasks. Every morning, they do this. And every night, it's the last thing that they do. Also, they just recently moved into a college dorm as a freshman, which is mind blowing that they have their life together so well, so quickly.
And had these incredible processes in place to help say stable with these reoccurring tasks. And I love the idea of the wind up wind down startup shutdown process. Having it in a checklist, having it in a step by step. So you don't even have to think about it.
And I am inspired to do something very similar, but maybe not anytime recent. Like soon, it'll be on my to do list for the future because right now I can't handle that. But I love this idea. And I love that they started it so soon. I love the fact that there doesn't have to be a checklist.
But if one works, like by all means use it, I have always been one of those people that I like lists. If I know what needs to happen and what needs to happen after that thing that just happened happened, then I am most likely going to write it down somewhere.
And just be able to check off the list of hey, this is done. This is done. This is done. This is done. I am also interested, Skyler to know how it changes as you go through process of integrating into school and college life and all those things.
I know that of course with big changes like one we're going to hear about in just a second. Stuff gets removed and stuff gets added. So let us know how how things go once you have spent a couple of weeks in your dorm and you're getting used to that whole college lifestyle.
And as someone who did not go to college, I am also interested in just what that looks like.
But something that came up another connection slash follow up came from Chris and he said in reference to episode four, something Jay said, hey, that's me hit home talking about Tetris being the thing that he does at the end of the day.
He had this flash of insight that the idea of context switching had disappeared during the pandemic and lockdown. It used to be at the end of the day, he'd get in his car and drive 40 minutes from home talking about Chris here.
So there was a very clear switch in mental context between work and home. Now Chris works at a desk literally 11 steps from his bed. So at the end of the day, there is nothing to trigger his mind into switch context.
So Chris has created the connection that he wants to figure something out that he can do at the end of the day to get him out of work mode. And I love that connection.
It's so important to have that context switching and I'm so proud of Chris of being able to recognize that and be able to acknowledge. Oh, hey, this is a problem. So a lot of times they the feelings that you have during the day, you don't really know what is causing them.
And so being able to like discover that main reason means that you can work on fixing it, not fixing fixing the wrong word, but you can work on changing kind of that mindset. I'd be really interested to learn what you decide.
I know, um, friend of show slash life slash both of our other co hosts for other shows Alex Cox has lights that have difference. So it's called scenes for work versus play versus sleep. And something like that makes it really easy to visually differentiate between what phase you should be in.
You can use different like not use your desk for anything other than work. Having the different zones that CGP Gray talks about in, you know, spaceship you. Anything you can do to trick your brain.
 In the past, I've done different hats like I've had a working hat like if I was doing a spreadsheet project, I would have a tiara like something that you physically have to do or visually or where different clothes or something, anything you can do to fix and help your monkey brain process what you're doing a little bit easier can definitely help.
Absolutely. And then we had one more connection from friend of the show because just being so consistent with those connection checks and even taking us to task, putting connection check in the discord and making me think about have I done my connection or not.
Mattie celebrated their day of last their last day of work and winding down that job.
And I know that it was amazing to see that and hear that and mentioned that the connection for the next fortnight is to create and print out some post mortem templates for my new analog task manager system, which brings me into our own connections Kathy.
I guess since Mattie was talking about post mortems, I can go first on that if you want. Yes, yes, let's have you go first. So my connection was to do a post mortem on a very stressful project. That project got more and more stressful as the deadline approached. I did finish it.
I did do a post mortem on that and I highlighted very specifically what made that project so stressful. And what I should never, ever, ever, ever, ever do again to avoid making projects like this in the future, you know, a little less stressful for me. Well done.
That is again, just like we talked with Chris, being able to recognize that key trigger issue. And that will help you get better at what you're doing in the future. And I'm so proud of you. What about you, Kathy? I know yours was a fight, right? So my connection was to ride the move. And I am here.
I am alive. I have survived. We are in the new house. We have slept here the last couple nights since today is Tuesday, September 7th. And we moved like we slept here Saturday night. So we had multiple days. Everything is is flowing. We're still alive. So present. We'll mark that as yes.
We have made the connection. We both did it. We both con did it. We con did it. I love it. And of course, I mentioned everyone shared their connections with us this week on discord. And the discord chat is still the happen in place to have conversations about what you're doing, where you're at.
Oh, sorry, that's that's the song. My plan. But if you want access to the discord chat as well as some bonus wallpapers and other things head over to relay.fm slash conduit. And you can become a member there.
And yeah, we're trying to figure out what we can do for all of our our premium conductors there that are that are helping the show grow and helping us every single fortnight. All this said almost every single week, but every to come up with great topics.
And speaking of people helping us come up with great topics, I'm about to get out the way because there was a great topic. Get out the way. Get out the way. J get out the way. Yeah, there was a great topic in discord that came at like the perfect time. We did not plan this.
We did not bribe the millennial Falcon to have this topic idea. I swear. So that being said, I'm going to read this topic idea. And then I'm going to move so that Kathy can unload a wave of this feeling that she's been having.
So topic idea from millennial Falcon says, what are some strategies for dealing with projects that are more of a marathon than a sprint like a move. What? How do you make sustained progress without feeling overwhelmed and burned out? I am over being overwhelmed. Kathy, please explain to us.
So clearly this was hinted at a little bit at our last episode. We had planned like this topic idea came out, but it also was already sitting in my head. I don't know if you know this, but buying a house is a lot.
It's a long term process just to go through the process of bidding, buying accepted offers, signings, all of that, all of that. But then you have the process of moving, which in and of itself is difficult when you've we I did the the counts. And in the last.
So I have been married for 16 years and we have lived in eight different places. That's a lot of moves, especially for someone like we're not in the military.
So it's all been very, very purposeful reasons that we have moved in that time for different location of whatever all in the same general area. But I'm very excited to not hopefully never move again. That being said, we have a lot of stuff that we have gathered over the years that we do not use.
We do not need. And so we're taking this time. And I say we very loosely because it's mainly me to go through and get rid of the stuff that no longer serves us very conmari. We're finding the joy in our possessions. But it's still it takes it takes time and it takes effort and it takes energy.
And the difficult part of it is the fact that I can't hire somebody else to do it. There's no one that can come and do this for me. And unless Marie condo wants to come over, but I don't have time for that. I also can't afford her, which is fine. It's fine.
That being said, though, we are in an extremely blessed situation where we do not need to be out of our apartment until the 23rd. That is our final day. I very specifically chose the option to only put in our 30 day notice after we'd gotten the keys to our new place.
And I did this knowing how difficult my back is and my anxiety on top of everything else going on because I'm always busy with work. But I am also in a major season of super like three huge projects have come into play. One of which is podcast a thon. It's for the best. It's great.
But they all came at the same time. And really, I don't appreciate that. That was not very like how dare they not saying that I'm disappointed or sad or any of that. But busy a season. If any of these things had come at a different time, it would have been so much better. But I did it.
And that's fine. Again, it's fine. Kathy, I wonder if that's where we can kind of get into the first part of a Falcons question of dealing with things that are a marathon and not a sprint.
I mean, like you said, you kind of strategically put in notice after everything had happened to give yourself more time is giving yourself more time than you really think you'll need one of those strategies. 100% and that that awareness of what you are able to do.
Being able to I know physically what I'm able to handle. I know what I can't handle. And instead of saying, Oh, I'm in my 20s. I'm perfectly fine. I can go and do this in a weekend and just give pizza and beer to friends and it'll be fine. That's not that's not the way it works for me anymore.
I'm almost 40. I have lots of physical issues. I am moving three different people. I know realistically that that there's no way that I could do it. And because we were in a position to allow this to happen and and make this setup. I have given myself that those very small goals that are every day.
So we Saturday was the day that I had scheduled a lot of help to come and I'm so incredibly thankful to our family and friends in the area that were able to safely do multiple groups of multiple trips. So not one person wasn't here for the whole time. We were still done at one o'clock.
I had moved everything on my very like very specific list of these are the heavy things that I can't move myself or even with one other person. I cannot fit them in my car. What needs to go my desk my file cabinets beds, et cetera.
I need a truck and I need strong people that will not be severely injured after to move these things. And those were done. I was done. So I told I had, oh my goodness, every single person who had graciously volunteered was like, okay, what else? And I'm like, no, this is it. What? Yeah, this is it.
Nothing else is ready. I'm not ready for you to bring anything else over. We're fine. We're good. We're great. Thank you so much for your help. That's it for now. No, like, uh, oh, okay. Cool. Okay. I'm like, this is the plan.
The next so every day I've tried to have a very specific small but significant goal. So yesterday was Labor Day in the United States. And one of like my main client slash jobs were closed for the day. And I instead of doing other things. Oh, let me play catch up. Let me do this stuff.
I knew in order to be ready for the work day. I would need to set up my computer, set up my zoom background, set up all of these important things that needed to get done that I needed to do before the work schedule. And that was my goal. I my computer is set up a background is set up.
I also did some work in the kitchen. And that's it. And then today I have very specific while my child is in dance. I have an hour and a half that I'm going to sort through boxes. Again, a very specific timeline. When it's done, it's done.
I will have no guilt for oh, I should do more because that that's a heart that's the hardest part for me is feeling this this guilt and this ableism and this. Oh, I should be able to just spend 12 hours get it all done and be finished and be done. And it's like, no, that's not that's not enough.
That's not how I should do this. It won't be healthy for me. It won't be healthy for my family. It won't be healthy for my clients. I will have no energy to get things done the way that it needs to be done. So instead, I'm going to be very, very strict. We'll see how this changes.
We have a few more. I have less than 20 days. I don't know. I can't math right now. What's 23 minus seven. Why would you ask me this on a podcast? I don't know. 16. Okay, so I have 16 days left. I have a little over two weeks to get things done.
Again, if I sit and think about that too much, I will start to freak out. I did last night have one of those moments where I was completely cycling in my head. I was spiraling. It was not a very pretty situation.
But being able to pull myself back, use my breathing techniques and you know, taking a bath and reading and having some medication that helps like all of these things for my diagnosis anxiety.
Also, like, okay, this stabilized me in a way that I could sleep so I could get up and be productive the next day. The trick is to make sure that you have some sort of structure.
But I also allow that structure to be flexible because if you, if you, if you have it to be where it's too rigid and I can't move with whatever needs to be done or whatever the life and situation is currently at, you're going to not be successful and it's going to hurt.
And it's going to be painful in many, many different ways. And I don't love that. Don't love that for me. I want to look at one of the words and in Millennial Falcons question. And it was, how do you make sustained progress, which I think that that is the hardest part.
Most people want to either, you know, you either call it a ramp or a burst where like if you have a burst, it's a whole lot of work and then it slowly tells off a ramp, you start off slow and you pick up the pace up until you're moving at this pace.
The idea of sustained progress is one of those things that I think a lot of people say to mean how do I keep doing a good job for a long period of time, but they don't think about the word choice.
So when you say something like sustained, that means how do I work at a pace that I'm comfortable with working it for a long period of time.
And I feel like you highlighted so many good points there about even though everyone else in the world is ready to keep going, you're not, which means you stop.
When you know that you're not going to be able to mess up or you're not going to be able to handle the mess up when it happens because it will happen.
Yes, I will just throw out there project management is a job like there are people they get paid to manage projects so that they can be ready for when things ultimately don't happen the way they expected it to.
So if a professional can make a good amount of money doing that and working for it, how can us as people who are just like i'm just here living my best life trying to do that, how can we be expected to just do everything and not expect things to not work out.
 The trick there is giving yourself space and giving yourself forgiveness and like the ability to work around those areas and I think that you know with this progress, Kathy, like you're doing great i've been in my house for almost five years now and we still have projects that we talked about on day one that are waiting.
The kudos to you and on the progress that you have made yeah it's it's it's so hard to not turn around and say to myself because I am my worst critic to go.
Uh, why aren't you done yet and I am trying to when I have those internal thoughts i'm trying to you know have lowly in response of no bad bad Kathy but not bad because that's and then I get into the spiral where i'm like how dare you talk to yourself that way.
Oh wait, I just talked to myself again that way trying to give myself forgiveness for so many different things but especially to help train my brain to try and be a little bit kinder to myself just as if I am kind to others.
And acknowledge that my limits on physical and emotional and mental things are not a failure in and of itself and that that's okay and this is normal and so having the sustained progress is sustained is such an important point to think about you cannot like it's not a good thing to do.
Every day is not going to be the same you cannot have every day be your PR you cannot get a personal record every day that's impossible it's not healthy if you like are you if you're making it that.
If you're making your goal to be hitting every goal every day it's only going to be disappointing and that's going to be frustrating and it's going to drag on you i'm looking at the overarching marathon that you're in is there at least 10% better are you completing a little bit.
Because some days you'll be able to do more than others some days you'll have better energy than others some days you'll be able to boom boom boom it's 10 o'clock and you're done with your list for the day like being able to recognize.
 The little things as well as the big steps and oh wow yesterday I was able to finish so many things in this progress in this process in this big marathon that's incredible and not kick yourself for oh but today I only did one of these tiny things that I was supposed to do just with everything in your life being able to.
Be kind and gentle to yourself and look at the overarching goal and purpose as well is important yeah the last part of this question is making that progress without feeling overwhelmed or burning out I think that.
 One again we didn't plan this so the fact that we've talked about getting away the fact that we've talked about what to do when you can't even or odd I think plays a role here you're you're not going to get away with a long term project a marathon isn't designed to be easy like ask anyone that's ever ran a marathon like they've never ran a marathon the road they were like it's.
 It didn't hurt at all it was great I was able to wake up this morning decided hey i'm going to run the marathon no training or anything and here you go yeah that doesn't work yeah so a marathon in general like there will be overwhelmed there will be burnout that I think the the better question is how do you make sustained progress.
Through feeling overwhelmed or feeling burned out again when you can't even or odd and I think that that's something else that you highlighted Kathy of well one you get help to you do the things that.
Help alleviate those situations whether it's getting enough sleep preparing yourself for the day doing those good startups good doing the good wind downs all of those things I think if you keep.
Moving again sustained progress you're you're moving at the same pace that is probably the biggest trick with running a marathon I have never run a marathon but I have walked a marathon on.
i don't know it's better than me yeah well bootcamp we kind of had to know that's true and I ran a few half marathons and the trick is it is sustained progress and you use all of the tools.
To keep pace and it's you know for us it was singing songs in our heads to keep cadence with our footsteps and you could tell when you were speeding up because as you were saying as you were singing your steps we get out of pace so. I think the best trick to do there is.
Don't jump for those those bonus wins as much as you think you probably want to I know like if when Kathy was talking about moving and her friends are like what else do we do.
There could have been a time where Kathy was like hold on let me box this up real quick and I can give it to you we can go but it was like no no no that that's it we're done here like we're we've done what we've set out to do i'm going to take a break now and we can.
Pick it back up at the next schedule time I am so bad about this I. Start out with too much on my plate I realize there's too much on my plate and then I.
Overwhelmed myself and try to like do all of the things when it's like no I should just pace myself and if there's too much on my plate take the stuff off the plate. Right. It's so hard.
It's so hard, especially in this world of hustle culture in this world of oh if we're not putting in 110% we failed and that's that's something to recognize and and try and do better for your.
Long term health and long term extra sustained as in how is your sustain progress for your entire life going to get better there will be phases of overwhelm there will be phases of burnout.
Unless you are very very blessed and being able to figure out ways to try and get out of that cycle and try and get better. Is important. I am again we didn't plan this I love this I had a conversation with a friend of mine today and we were just catching up with each other and.
 He asked me is like how many hours do you think you're putting in for your work and I just said I probably around 14 to 16 a day is like how much sleep are you getting and I was like five hours and his next words were just what are you doing for self care to keep you from burning out and it was like.
I don't know like right and at that point and this is where I'm trying to get to have good friends have people that are going to call you out on your BS of working too hard.
 Because his next comment was let's take a 10 or 15 minute walk will jump on a call and will walk together that way we can both take a break and to me that if we're talking about strategies having someone catch you when you're picking up the pace or not moving as fast as you were and being able to help you make that move.
I think is probably the biggest thing because again we're not going to want to do it we're not going to want to slow down we're not going to want to get out of that funk that we're in we're going to say that we want it but we're not going to actually want it and having someone say.
up I see a red flag let me jump in and help you out of this is so massive and such a wonderful thing and that's why I like doing these shows because.
Being able to keep in touch with Kathy Kathy helps catch me on my own BS and then make sure that I get pulled out of it so thank you Kathy you're keeping me from being overwhelmed is hey thank you to.
Like it's it's so it's so funny can we talk about your wife your your gorgeous amazing talented incredible wife and the the spiral that you calling me and having me talk to her. Oh absolutely pulled me out of so first off I got a call from Jay which always.
Hi I'm a millennial who died is always my question or what did I do wrong for the record I am a caller I I will.
If I need to get an answer I will call but even if you don't answer there will probably be a text message after the fact with what I was saying and I had I explained this earlier to someone.
If I send somebody a text message then I'm expecting them to get back to me whenever they can and it's not like a time sensitive thing if I call it's not that it's an emergency it's just it's probably time sensitive or something that's happening in that moment. Yes which I get. However I broken.
Yes. My brain is broken it's it's it's it's it's fine yes and anyways I was in the middle of a huge funk I we had not actually moved moved yet I think it was like last I don't know.
I was freaking out basically um he didn't know that at the time that I was freaking out but I totally was I was in a terrible move.
 I was in a terrible state I couldn't like it was just bad it was terrible um and he called and after I realized that everything was fine I was not in trouble um we got I I've I've been to the little bit and then he asked if there was somebody that his wife could talk to she's been doing maybe we'll have her on it one of one of these times if she would love that you you you take the baby and I'll just have a podcast with her um bonus episodes yeah relay dot FM slash condo it become a member these bonus episodes are piling up.
 Yeah sometime in the future maybe we'll get that done um but we she how do we talk about her situation um not a situation that sounds like terrible basically you know feeling the grind getting burned out getting overwhelmed needed some help and switching my brain into that mode of helping somebody else also helped my brain calm down and it helped me realize that oh hey I can help problem solve other people's problems I could probably probably do this for myself too but it's really hard it's really hard when you are when your brain is talking to your own brain to to like get out of that cycle um and by the time I hung up with her selfishly I felt so much better I blame the giggling child um oh my god that my child has the best laughter and maybe it'll become a sound bite in the future uh it's so good it's so good the innocence of a child maybe that's one of the best strategies to wrap up on to is laugh like get find find the things that make you smile and give you energy and you know I've I've mentioned before for me that sitting there playing Tetris on a super old Nintendo um or you know talking with Kathy about the show or something crazy or ridiculous going on in my life I learned today I have a phrase that I use called you hate to see it and with the acronym the acronym YHTSI sounds like Yatsi so now every time I think about like oh so frustrated it's like Yatsi and now I'm like excited again and it's so fun but just having those little things that can inject a little bit of you know happiness and energy into what you're doing will make it feel less like a marathon and more like a fun uh and still I mean there are people that enjoy marathons I don't understand but I love you anyways uh and and they enjoy them to the point where they are parties you know I I love looking at the pictures of like run Disney's um with all of the people dressed up in characters which are just so fun and I'm so glad that things are our options are becoming available to be able to participate in those types of things for the people that do them I am not one of them but good on you I think the best way to say that uh in the famous words of Parks and Rec Treetio Self Treetio Self absolutely while speaking of treating ourselves I think it is time for our upcoming connections Kathy you you've been overwhelmed you are over being overwhelmed you've got some sustained progress what is your connection uh to hold us over until the next episode my connection is uh to take more baths okay I know it's it's random it's a little bit of self-care our new house has a bathtub that my six foot body actually fits in I'm very excited um but I haven't been able not justify but kind of justify taking a bath because oh this is wasted time and that's silly that's ridiculous um so I would like to take uh at least more than one bath as a as self-care with the whole shebang I want epsin salts I want I don't know flowers something I want to do candles and I want to read a book and that is that is my connection for the next fortnight jay what is yours my connection is actually coming from one of our other connections and that is making a list a very long list uh for context I had a project that I was working on again the project that my last connection required a postmortem of and in the end I spent about three weeks of work on something that did not turn into anything so my goal is to make nothing out of something or I guess something out of something instead of nothing out of something so I am going to make a list of the things that I learned in this project that I can turn into future projects and I'm going to try to go for sustained effort here I'm not going to start on any of them I'm not going to promise that I'm going to you know make videos or anything I'm just going to make the list oh I feel like this is a great connection because not only doesn't have the goal to do something but it has a stop point and you have to actually stop at that stop and that's really it's impressive I think if we were going to call this anything it would be stopping at the stop point so I am I am going to focus on first of all making something out of something and stopping at the stop point I love that oh we're important well if people want to catch up I don't want to say catch up on your bath time because catch up in baths just should not go together no but if someone wants to check in and see how your connection is going Kathy how can they do that yeah you can find me on social media I am at Mrs.
Soup or you can hang out with us in the discord Jay where can people check with you and make sure that you've stopped at your stop point I'm going to say on Twitter at KJAY Miller and of course in the discord if you want to talk to either one of us we are in the relay.
fm discord where if you are a member you can share your connections with us and you can just check in and have such a wonderful time I have dubbed every other Thursday as conduit Thursday because the productivity channel starts bumping after a new show has gone out so to be fair let's be honest the productivity channel is always bumping but productivity the conduit Thursdays mean that it's actually bumping with productivity talk it's like a celebration and that's what this show is about it celebrating the things that we get done and helping to provide a little bit of guidance for when we need help but Kathy you made a big move I got to ask did we can't do it we can't did it Jay we can't did it that
