From Relay FM, you're listening to Conduit, the show we Condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, I'm Jay and I'm not even going to let my co-hosts introduce themselves because my co-hosts doesn't need an introduction.
Folks, I am with the unicorn of the business world literally wrote the book on how to get help. The person that makes sure that entire podcast networks stay up 24 or 7 even when Facebook can't. The one the only Mrs. Super Self Kathy Campbell.
Hi Kathy, how are you? I was, yeah, I definitely needed to be so friends before the show started. Jay, I'm going to break the fourth wall here. Jay was like, oh, I was going to do something and then figured Kathy would be, I don't even remember what you said I would be.
I'm so excited and angry at the same. I'm so excited and angry and yes, and then throughout that intro, so yeah. Welcome to Conduit, we're so happy you're here and the absolute amazing Jay is hosting this episode today and I'm super stoked.
Should have told me no, speak no, no, that's what we're going to be talking about later, but I had to get that little bit of affirmations out to my wonderful co-host speaking of affirmations. I think we have some shout outs for the first time on the show.
Kathy, what is the affirmations app? The affirmations app is one of the best apps in the app store. It's finally out of beta and we are so proud of our conductor Justin who has brought into the world this incredible app.
Not only is it an app whose widget will send you notifications or have a widget on the home screen or wherever you want it, giving you some positivity in your life, but the app itself has a wide array of customization features. It has a fidget mode.
So all of the little haptic feedback ticks and spin the wheels and buttons and all of the goodness.
It has a ton of amazing resources for anything that you could need for mental health, mental help and any of that for all over the world, like global resources and it also has a brief feature so that you can sit and just take a moment.
And then also there's a fancy little tip section because Justin was very adamant that he wanted to make sure that he provided this for free and refused to put a paywall on it which means that you can just throw him money in the tip form and make him blush every single time.
So I don't know about you, but I've done that a couple times and it makes me so happy when our friends are able to finish something that they've worked so hard on and is worthy of the incredible support that he's received with that. True story about to happen.
I found out about the affirmations app when it went live, downloaded it and showed it to my wife who then proceeded to use the fidgets tool on it for a good 20 minutes on my phone.
Not her phone because she could have downloaded the app herself, which I think she did after the fact, but took my phone from me and proceeded to use it. But Justin, thank you so much for this app. It's absolutely wonderful. I love the notifications I get.
I love when I'm stressing or feeling a little zombified. I just can open up the app and have a nice, pretty and very customizable message. Just let me know that there's so much beauty in the world and I deserve to be here.
These are actually affirmations that I just pulled up on my phone right now to show you how relevant they are to you when you have these amazing apps made by amazing people. So thank you, Justin. We're going to have a link in the show notes for that.
I also want to give a shout out to two people that I have come to meet and know better over the last year. And that is highly, highly and Heidi. I'm sorry, Heidi. Those are Heidi and Heidi. Oh my goodness. Wow. Oh, yeah. Please save me. Those are Heidi and Haley from Make Work Work. Stop.
Hey, folks, Jay here. Yeah, it's actually, Haby and Haley, Haby and Haley from Make Work Work. Not bad. An amazing podcast of two friends just figuring out how to make work work and going through life. If you love conduit, you will absolutely love this show.
I think of it as if you took the things that we talk about and showed what they look like in just life happening. That is Make Work Work. Both of these amazing ladies are doing fantastic things in their careers and in productivity. And they also gave conduit a shout out.
So we're reciprocating and we're going to shout out twice as loud. Those two. Those two. So awesome. What about this last one? Yeah, another pair of fantastic people we're going to give a shout out to our friends of the show, Skyler and Kim.
If you are part of the relay discord, you will know them as the dragons. Skyler is the blue dragon and Kim is the book dragon. And they have just been incredible support for everyone in the discord. And they have a podcast now. It's called Find My Dragon.
And their tagline is Two Friendly Dragons, Kim and Skyler talk about random things. But what it is is an absolute delightful relationship that you are seeing grow on audio. The very first episode they're talking about the very basic of podcasting, like how to sync audio and like get audio to work.
It's just two human dragons that are just absolutely delightful. And you just want to give them both a nice warm hug. So if you want to friendly people talking in your ears, as we head into the colder months in the Northern Hemisphere, I had a recommend Find My Dragon.
I as soon as you told me about this, I immediately subscribed. My favorite podcasts are literally two friends talking about their friendship. And I think that that is something that a lot of folks that I've talked to in like podcasting world are like, I don't know what to talk about.
And in my head, I'm just like, just just talk like most people will show up for you before they show up for your content or at least the people that you want to stick around. Yeah.
So one of the biggest things that I've learned in the several years of doing friends new years and talking to people that have been listening to podcasts for decades is that people will start a show for the topic, but they stay around for the voices.
They stay around for the people that are doing it. And the very intimate nature of podcasts means that you get to become friends with these strangers. But sometimes these people that start podcasts are your friends. And that also makes it very cool.
So I guess aside from connections, which we'll get to, if you have shout outs and you're a friend of the show that you want us to know about, become a member of Relay FM at Relay.fm slash conduit. Join us. Let us know in the discord what you're doing.
We absolutely will love it and want to support it as much as possible. And hopefully shout outs can make it come back to the show. And if it does, I will need to find a bumper for it. So I'm just going to use this for now. All right. Awesome. Moving on to connection checks. Step.
Let's talk about meal planning. How did, how did meal planning go? Well, when I made this connection, I forgot to take into a question. So count the fact that I would be gone for half of the time. So that I didn't do anything official. I did wrap.
I did cook instead of just like grabbing snacks or you know, reheating something I made some taco meat that can be used in a variety of different ways. We did a chicken and rice, which had leftover rice, which meant we could have things in a couple of ways.
But I didn't decide that until like the afternoon. And so I'm saying that this connection failed. I don't think I'm quite ready for it. My life is still a little bit too frenetic, frenetic, frantic. Hmm. What are words? It's not right.
I think in the future I will come back to this connection and give it the energy that it needs to have something sustainable that will benefit my family as a whole in addition to myself. So yeah, the future will have a better connection for it, but this fortnight alas, it failed.
I think that's okay though. I mean, meal planning is absolutely one of those things that you have to have. I mean, it's almost like a spice cabinet.
Like you can't just be like, I'm going to get a spice cabinet and then spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars on spices having no idea what you're going to use them for. Right.
So I feel like meal planning is one of those things that it's best done kind of slowly and methodically of like step one, figure out what my family likes to eat.
Step two, figure out what time I have available to me and like starting slow with maybe I just plan one meal for the week, like having like taco Tuesday. That's always a great one. That's an easy one. It's it's thematic. No, spaghetti sundaes is another one that I've heard of. I love it.
Yeah, I think again, it's it's being kind to myself and understanding that, hey, this is not a failure because the connection didn't work. This is not how we do it in the famous words of Montel Jordan. Oh, this is how we do it. KJ, show me how to do it.
So my connection for this week was to not miss out and I totally feel like I did it really well. Definitely sometimes where I struggled, but I will just throw out there. I had a couple of good opportunities to spend time alone and in the moment with what I was doing and I totally did it.
I did so much. I distracted myself into making a video, even as we're recording this last night, I actually said, I'm going to spend some time alone and take care of some madman stuff for work.
And you know, I'm just going to sit here and think about what I want to get done and how I want to get it done at a time where I'm not inundated with emails. I'm not inundated with Slack messages. I don't have, you know, my kids asleep, my wife's playing video games with family.
So I can just have this time for me. And then in terms of spending time with family, that was another thing that got to happen. I got to spend some time just myself and my daughter. My wife and I spent a lot of time cleaning up our kitchen because we've had a bunch of birthdays all at once.
So and people might think like, okay, that's kind of cheating. But you know, it really was cool to be able to just sit there and do dishes. And you know, my wife was like drying dishes off as I'm washing them and you know, we're cleaning up together and we're joking and having a good time.
And honestly, even those things that we don't want to do become so much easier when you can just ask someone around you that you care about, hey, let's just knock this out and have fun and you know, spray each other with water and like have a good time. Just really enjoy the moment.
Oh, spraying each other with water sounds like torture right now, but I can see how it could be like beneficial. I have them all anyway. Yeah. I love that like getting to hang out with people, being able to you know, spend time with the people that you love and enjoy spending time with.
It doesn't matter what you're doing. If you get to do this, I love the way that you did this challenge. And I think you did two thumbs up and nailed it. I love the way we also moved into our connections from our conductors.
We have a few of these and I want to kind of jump off with the first two, which were themes like system naming like connections, which are awesome.
I love the movement that we've started where people are dumping the idea of following the trend and using those those hash tagable names and coming up with their own that are fun. Like Scott who decided to go with the food fighter system. Scott, I have a confession to make.
I love the name of the food fighter system. I think it's awesome. You pick that system because it relies on different colors and shapes. A red X, a blue check and a green star to track progress on seven keywords on a daily basis.
Decided against a direct reference to the album, the color and the shape. I also prefer to hear it in my head, spoken in Christopher Walken's voice. I'm not doing food fighters. But Kathy, tell me about Izzy's because I heard this and I immediately started shouting in my head. Yes.
So Izzy's connection check from a while ago, but better late than never. Absolutely. After a bunch of experimentation, I've ended up labeling the top box of my theme system journal sales sales. Sales sales. It is the year the sale after all. Sale as an essay. I L by the way.
Writing down each thing that my actions today show I care about is amazing how much difference framing makes in answering a question.
What did I care enough about to work on today versus what did I do today give almost the same answer, but with a very different feeling about them? I adore this so very much because it's so true.
Being able to kind of form the frame around what's going on can completely change the mindset, which can completely adjust your mood and your willingness and ability to do other things or take break. That vibe is so important and that's exactly what we're going for.
I love everything about this, but especially the sale. It's now always in my head. Even if it doesn't work, you can play it on my A D D. Wow. Deep cut. Deep cut. Speaking of deep cuts, friend of the show, Maddie, deep cut the whole idea of brain dumping and just getting it out of her head.
She said, I brain dumped a lot. I brain dumped so much that I still feel scattered, but I'm making progress. I'm only doing this because it's going to make sense. My connection is to continue for another two weeks. I need more time.
And then we got a second one from Maddie that says, I don't feel scattered anymore. I feel like I called my active projects down to a manageable level. That's the point. That's the idea is just getting it all out and just making that determination of like something's got to go. I can't do it.
At some point, I'm just going to have to stop and then figure out how I can just make all of the things that are super important, the only things that are there. And I love that Maddie went into it and just kept brain dumping and recognized that she wasn't done.
But something I know I have a problem with a lot of times is I will say, have this expectation of, okay, so I've brain dumped for half an hour. So I'm done. Even though my brain is still full, even though I'm still scattered, even though I'm still drained or whatever.
And I'll just be like, well, you know, this was enough time to put into it. So I'm finished.
And instead, I think that it would benefit every piece of me if I recognize that it's okay to maybe take a break and come back and brain dumps some more or do it the next day or something like that to not be, it's not performative brain dumping. It's purposeful brain dumping.
And I think that is something that Maddie just completely nailed. And I'm so happy that she got to the point where she's feeling not as scattered. I love what about Ryan? Oh, talk about scattered. Previously, Ryan informed us on his like job search and all of that.
Well, turns out he's got a job and is moving to a different state. And as someone who just moved a few blocks from my previous home, I wish you all the best of luck and patience and lack of pain and pressure and stress.
And I hope that the end of the month when it comes, everything is as smooth as possible. Absolutely. And Ankenu, I'm right here with you. Ankenu says, I peanut buttered my connection. So I basically didn't do any of the music plans that I had and got rerouted. I think honestly, it's okay.
I mean, the fact that you know, friend of the show Alex Cox does another show. A show called, do by Friday, which if you like this show and you're an adult, I emphasize you're an adult. You should go listen to that show too.
They give themselves tasks every week and they often peanut butter on those tasks, but at least they gave themselves time to their challenges. Exactly. They're challenges. Oh, sorry, challenge. Challenge. Yeah. So those challenges are, I mean, they're sometimes they're not designed to be easy.
And I know Ankenu, like you, you're doing a lot. So don't feel bad if something had to wait. I think the idea there is to ensure that you're at least thinking about it. If y'all know me, my system is not about what needs to be done. It's about what I'm doing.
There are a lot of things that I peanut butter on all the time because I just didn't get to it and that's perfectly fine. And I love that you may not have done what you planned to do. And yet you re-routed to preparing for an informal video shoot. That is completely amazing.
So I don't think that you necessarily peanut butter and I think you pivoted and had a different, a different option. Oh, that's good. You could write a book on that. Oh. pivot, don't peanut butter. Amazing. Oh, go ahead.
I was just going to say in last but not least, we have Ellen taking away Kathy. So Ellen has moved out from her previous place and after six hours of scrubbing walls in the old house, they had and enjoyed a bath. Apparently, it was not as luxurious as mine, but I don't know. It sounds pretty great.
And so I'm so proud of you, Ellen. The bath movement in conduit is a thing. I feel like there's something here. Conduit bath bombs or something. We should look at that. We should definitely look into that. I'm not going to lie, Kathy. And some of my time to myself when I wanted to relax, baths.
Yeah. They're there. It's a thing. Amazing. Well, before we jump out of this, I want to mention that all of our topics, all of our connections this week came from people within our community. And it's absolutely amazing.
We have so many wonderful people in the relay of them chat talking about productivity, talking about life, providing follow up. I love that people are noticing that when we release these, I think someone mentioned like, I love how conduit just takes over the chat rooms on Thursdays.

So Kathy, how have things been going? Have they been going pretty terrible for you lately? No. Oh, well, I mean, don't you just love traffic? No. What about a squid soup pie? Is that your favorite dessert? No. I mean, Kathy, it sounds like you're pretty good at saying no.
No? For those that don't know, our topic for this week is saying no. I feel like it's something we're so good at, but also so bad at. It's been a journey and definitely, I don't know about Jay, but I'm constantly having to work on making sure that I am saying no when it's really important.
And trying to get better at saying no when it's not as important. Yeah. The challenge that I have is usually whether or not I want to say no isn't based on importance. It's based on how cool the thing sounds. So for me, anytime someone's like, I'll have this idea for a thing in my head.
It's immediate like, oh, yeah, then you could do this and do this. Before we were recording, I was talking about this thing that I want to do where I can hold like local tournaments at conferences where I work and then like use that information in my head.
I'm like, this is probably like 200 hours of work that you're volunteering yourself for.
Are you sure you want to do this? It's paid or like a benefit like, yeah, it's been who've having a very hard time, not just saying no, but readjusting priorities to things that I've said said yes to previously. But knowing that if I had just said no in the first place, I wouldn't be in this issue.
And the drama, not drama, but like my life is not better because I said yes to something a lot of the times. There are so many incredible things that I have said yes to that I don't regret at all. But I have recently been on a journey of re-evaluating options and choices that come into my life.
So that I'm not getting as overwhelmed and that means I have to say no. And before we continue on this, I want to mention yes, we understand there are so many books, so many podcasts, so many videos that are all about the power of saying no.
One, I want to say no to all of those because I usually get very frustrated and upset because like hearing the same thing over and over and over again doesn't make it any easier. But that being said, we do want to provide some things that we do that make saying no a little bit easier.
We've kind of broken it down into spaces. One, telling people know which I think is a lot easier than the second one, which is telling ourselves no. So Kathy, I want to know you're a fancy business person with all these responsibilities.
And I know that for you, when you have to tell, I don't know, a new client or a potential client, no, there's like a monetary punishment to that.
How do you do it? It helps, let me start off by saying that I am aware of the privileged position that I'm in and that I can say no to clients and I can't or potential clients. I can maybe transition off for them a different opportunity, specifically if they're not ready for what I provide.
It's so much easier when those red flags are going off. And I know that this is not going to be a good relationship. This isn't going to benefit me. It's not going to benefit them. It's going to just take time after an energy that we don't want to provide. And so those are really easy.
Those are really because I have learned over the many years that I've been doing this, that hey, it's better for me if I say no now than put any more anything into my business. And not just with business relationship, but personal relationships too.
And I'm not saying, oh my gosh, you did something wrong and now I'm never going to be your friend anymore.
But there's a pattern of behavior that can happen with people that if you're paying attention and are looking at it in a serious way, you can say, okay, this relationship is harming me more than it's helping. Maybe it's time to say no to the energy that they're draining from me.
And I get that it's so hard and it's so difficult. None of this is easy. Like I said, it's a constant working process. But I know that I am so much happier because I've started saying no and saying no in a way that feels authentic to me too.
Not being mean, not being harsh, not being a jerk, but being able to be a little bit selfish and not in the negative context of it. But in a, I need to take care of myself so I can take care of others.
So I love how the Cathy is very professional and super business like I tell people know in the most ratchet way possible. That's just my goal in life is I want to find the most creative way to tell somebody no.
And one of the funniest things that I've discovered recently is there's been a a TikTok trend that talks about the phrase F around and find out that is like you may test that assumption at your earliest convenience. That's so good. It really is.
And that has inspired me to just think about all of the unique and yet still somewhat up. I don't want to say polite but professional ways to tell people know. And in my head, I hear like all of like my mom and my sisters like what you're not going to do is.
And that is that is how I say no is I make it. The biggest challenge of like how can I not only say no in a unique way but to get my point across so that people know that I am not just saying no but I'm setting a boundary.
And I think that is that is a thing that makes saying no in the future even easier. People know if I have you know a thing happening. If my daughter which is not in school the moment but if my daughter has a thing. The answer is yes to her before it is yes to anyone else.
If I have to say no to her, I'm going to be really sad because that's a thing that I struggle with is telling my daughter no in general. Therefore it is much easier for me to tell someone who I don't have to change diapers on which luckily she's potty trained now so we don't do that anymore.
But even in a world where she wasn't potty trained, her yeses are more important than saying no to anyone else. Therefore I will do that. The other side of that is also being able to tell people no without telling them no. And that is just one of the best ways in my opinion of doing it.
If someone's like I have this great idea for you, set the standard so high that they no longer have that idea for you. I've had a few people ask me like hey can you do this thing for me or oh hey I have this idea what does this look like? And I go well let's set up a consultation call.
Oh a consultation why does it have to sound so professional because it is and I love what I do and I'm good at it. Therefore I deserve to get paid and my rates are probably higher than you can afford. So I'm sorry if you really want this you gotta go through the process.
Man that is a great great not game to play but it's like when there's when there's something that I don't want to do but I feel like I need them I need them to break up with me. I can't be the one to break up with them.
 Making sure that you're like staying true and holding tight to your boundaries in that way and you know making charging your full rates maybe charging more you are in charge of your business you're in charge of your time and it's okay to to give whatever out that might help you feel better to say no by letting them be the one that says no that's a great idea.
 It also helps to know that by saying no you open up the door to a better yes and I don't mean that in like that you get more time to do the things that you enjoy but it's like quite literally you can raise your rates on things that you do that you're good at and there will be people that will just be like okay I will pay that and I have learned that so many times and more than anything beware of vultures beware of people that will just pick your body to death and then continue to pick it they will pick your time they will pick your attention they will saying yes to them even once opens the door for them to just completely drain you of all time energy and passion and the things that you want to do.
We're heading into spooky season and that means that the vampires are coming out to play and we all we've only got one more episode knocked over that means we have to we might have to do the vampire episode. Oh I'm here yes okay make a note of that.
Awesome so we're gonna put a pin in that one about beware of the vampires that are around but we've talked about telling other people know what about telling ourselves no because that's a little bit different.
 It's so difficult so I know Jay you have a lot of ideas you get a lot of excitement you get our passion of passionate about projects that you do and I'm the same way and that makes it very difficult to say no to ourselves we get a great idea and decide hey if I just did this what would that look like.
 Oh my gosh it's a great idea this this is a niche that's not being covered this is a hole in the market that's not being filled I need to go do it but really the effort and time to make it happen and flourish in a way that's more than just what I can provide now means that really it's probably not going to be beneficial it's not going to directly influence my day to day joy my day to day income my day to day whatever you're you're trying to track but it's so exciting and it's shiny and it's new and you watched all of the YouTube's and you did all the research and even though you should have said no to yourself before all of that happened and yeah I don't have an answer for this to me my my answer is again it goes back to that opening up the door to a better yes and I think that that is where I've gotten with myself of hey there's an opportunity available to me okay what if I say no to this to open the door to an even bigger opportunity and I know that sometimes that's pie in the sky thinking and and sometimes you just don't have the ability to do that and I will absolutely acknowledge the privilege that I have in being able to just not take opportunities when they happen but to be honest there's there have been very few opportunities that like people were like it's an hour never and then I jumped on them and honestly it would have been better off with just the never approach yeah I mean a good example of this and I I learned this from the one Kathy Campbell probably three years ago I was trying to turn what I was doing as a podcast into like a full-time production business and I had reached out to Kathy who I had met through a potential client of mine and just having the conversation Kathy was like yeah we can totally do this let's set up a consultation call it'll be like a bajillion dollars that's not what she really said but in my head that's what it felt like and I had the money to do it and in my head I was like I could do this I could get going but I feel like if I go through with it now I'm not going to be able to benefit because I mean I still had a full-time job I was doing all this stuff I really didn't have the time and a new baby I didn't have the time or the energy to commit to the big goal and I was like yeah Kathy that sounds great let me look at some stuff and I will get back to you and I'm ready to get started and I just didn't oh yeah and guess what I knew that that was the right thing for you I didn't go oh my gosh Jay what are you thinking how dare you not give me my money like no I knew I could tell I could feel that that wasn't the right thing for you right now well and I mean I was still hard headed and said yes to other opportunities and you know those burned out and I was like man I probably should just said no to those and then they came back and I charged them twice as much so as you can see when you say no to certain things and yes to other things and then those yeses should have been knows it you learned like I would say that's probably the biggest advice that I have on telling myself no is think about the last time you said yes to this what happened and that to me anytime you have to tell yourself but this time it'll be different um this isn't a relationship advice podcast but think about what the relationship advice podcast would tell you if you told them but yeah this time it's going to be different well and along that those same lines um and enthusiastic consent is very similar to this and that you should enthusiastically want to say yes not just a lukewarm yeah that sounds like fun or okay I could see this being xy or z but making it something that you literally can't stop thinking about that you were so excited that you dream about it because you've said no to other things and you have the space to make it happen kind of like this podcast for example means that the things that come into your life are that are making you scream from the rooftop yes means that it's worth it and it's gonna it's not going to be an immediate thing that you can magically be able to tell yourself no easily all the time but hopefully we're helping you get to the point where you can work on it and get better at when to say no so that you can start saying yes to the real things totally and just as capy mentioned like this show this show would not have been a yes had I not been willing to say no to other things I had five shows when I met capy and now I'm down to one yeah and and a part of that was making sure that my yeses had enough space by saying no to other things and again we know that there are so many tropes and we've tried to avoid all of them in doing this but there is very much when you say no to one thing you can it it's not necessarily saying yes to something else well it is but we're not going to get all super motivational here but it's it's giving yourself space to say yes to the things that you really want to do and just like how we had um how we had Ankenu earlier who just said you know what I'm a peanut butter he said yes by saying no and it might be stressful at the time of just like hey I'm not able to do this thing that I really want to do at the moment but that also gave me space to go do this other thing that I really wanted to do and maybe wanted to do a little bit more than this other thing so I think being able to reward yourself when you say no by enjoying the things that you're saying yes to will make you more excited the next opportunity you get to tell somebody no or in a the way that I would do it see what you're not going to do is invade my time and my space and my opportunities like that yeah yeah keeping keeping that those boundaries in play means that you will get to enjoy the joy to come because other opportunities will always appear and you may not be able to see them if you're trying to fight the the yeses that you've done that weren't really right so what we're saying is say yes to know you'll know oh okay oh yes no no no but we are going to say yes to our our connections for this coming week Kathy what is your connection uh my connection I'm going to pull from friend of the show Maddie because I am with the move and with being gone for a week I am feeling so scattered and so just like discombobulated with everything going on and I think I need to brain dump until I'm done and that may be a multiple day process and I'm okay with that we are going to brain dump it all the way I'm going to sit in my fancy bean bag chair and burn a candle and drink some water and brain dump on my iPad and just spill it all out into nobility got it brain dump until you're done brain dump it all the way bean bag candle water iPad iPad all the dumpage all the brains just going to happen spill it all over like a zombie I was going to say you could you could definitely be a zombie in our our new our octoberish uh the themes that we have here I I love this I will always tell people I love doing brain dumps I feel like the micro brain dumps are good but it's the ones that take days that you just feel so in control and so in the know about what you've got going on um I'm jealous because I would love to do a brain dump I can't right now but what I will do is my connection um I'm going to be out of town in the in between times of our recordings and I'm going to be at a people event an event with people which terrifies me it's the first one that I've gone to in almost two years um I don't know what to do um but it's for work and it's also the first time that I get to meet some of my co-workers for the first time in person which is fantastic and wonderful and amazing and terrifying all at the same time because I'm socially awkward and I'm going to try my best not to be but I know that I'm an introvert so my goal my connection for this week is to say no to plans once to give myself permission to say no because I'm going to be in the moment everybody's going to want to do that thing and I'm going to be like but I'm so tired and I don't want to do it so I'm going to have to say no and I'm going to have to get good at saying no and I'm not going to get all you know snappy with and be like well what you're not going to do is deny me my tacos for dinner but what what I will do is just politely say you know I'm a little spent I think I'm just going to go back to my hotel room and relax um so I'm going to say yes to hanging out in the hotel room where I do my traditional watching ridiculousness for like four hours because it's always on and that will involve saying no to co-workers and friends and people who I am meeting and hanging out with for the first time amazing that is great and totally on par for this show episode and I think we have some conductors that also have some connections for this week um Ankenu who very much has inspired us this episode says I think my connection is to ground myself in some hobby time and help reduce some resistance I feel towards actuation that is a ten dollar word my friend wow actuation in my work life and recalibrate my you're just trying to sound smart here I see what you're saying well nailed it you are doing a great job at that um grounding yourself in some hobby time uh yes yes do this I do have any feelings on hobbies oh I love hobbies in fact I have a few hobbies have I have I ever told you about the wonderful world of Tetris what oh yeah it's totally a thing you should hear about it some time I'm so excited to hear what hobbies you have Ankenu I'm so excited uh Maddie has their next connection um defining the theme it's getting towards the end of the year which means it's almost time for the new yearly themes but also they had their theme is the chapter of dots um and it wasn't working for them anymore and so um she's saying that she felt she needed some stability on foundation and judica helped her come up with a resonant phrase of the season of foundation to get started and uh she just needs to decide what that foundation needs first and I love that not only did she recognize that the yearly theme that she had picked was not correct which is always impressive um and but she figured out what she does need it to be and more importantly is able to look at the steps that it's gonna take to make that foundation work and that's super impressive and we're so happy uh that you've gone through and done what you're doing and I can't wait to hear how it's going all right so Tony man I will say our community has done some wonderful things with their name changes uh for the season and it's making it really hard it's really hard for me to figure out these things it's really difficult but it's fine it's fun it's hard it's fun but Tony uh said my connection for the next little while not even for the next couple weeks for the next little while so we'll have to check back in with Tony when he's done with this is building back habits into his life with compassion um he says I've fallen into a toxic productivity trap where I had lots of routines set up but if I didn't complete all the habits and the routines my inner critic would round off would round on me and I'd feel like rubbish I think I know where Tony's from um so for the past couple of months I've deliberately let my routines fall away and focus on building up my self-compassion and now I think I might be ready to dip my toe back in uh Tony best of luck to you my friend I I really love this idea of saying I I want to be more productive but I don't like how I'm treating myself as I'm trying to be more productive so let me let me just let some things fall away and once I feel like I'm in a good space to love on myself I can now slowly reintroduce some of these things but do it in a way that isn't going to feel so toxic yes making sure that you are able to give yourself that grace and kindness because none of us are perfect no one can do everything perfectly every day and I think it's so important and I'm so proud of you for being able to recognize and acknowledge that you need that compassion and being able to publicly state it and being able to say hey I know I want to do this and I need to do it with compassion means that you will succeed absolutely um and then we've got one a great one I think we're on Dave uh so Dave uh has a thought and an idea and I'm so happy um so he says a potential topic suggestion being productive self-developing from a place of self-loving acceptance of who you are might just be me but a lot of my drive desire to be productive self-developed came and still does but to a lesser extent from a place of dissatisfaction with who I felt I was at the moment and where I was in my life what skills techniques can we deploy or develop so we can be productive we're also accepting we are worthy of love as we are in this moment and first off let me just say that is what this show is about we wanted to make sure that we were able to recognize and acknowledge who we are as people where we are in our life and be not necessarily content because we do want to grow and try and be better people but recognizing that where we're at isn't necessarily wrong we have not failed as humans because we are making mistakes being able to realize that we can love ourselves and still want to be better and I love that Dave put this so like greatly because yes we are all worthy of love and we are worthy of loving ourselves and what we are doing and it you can't take a book that says you have failed because you're not waking up at 4 a.
m.
 and and and having that harm yourself mental state and your your mental beliefs and your thoughts and your day-to-day stuff because you can't wake up at 4 being able to recognize where you work best how you work best and why you're working and what you're doing and playing and all of those things and being able to turn around and say this is who I am right now this is my goals for the future I just I please please give yourself love we're here to help remind you to love yourself and that you are worthy of that love and worthy of that care and worthy of being the best person that you are two things on this one Dave have you met Tony I feel like you and Tony would have a great conversation I feel like that I feel like what we've done here is we've created a space where people who think alike can come in and share their thoughts and then go off and like converse with one another and really start to make for better productivity conversation and I love that so Dave one connection suggestion reach out to Tony and say hey Tony what are some of the things that you're doing to bring that compassion back in and to bring you know to kind of get rid of some of that the toxicity or the dissatisfaction that you're seeing and if for some reason Tony's not available go back and listen to some of the episodes that we've put out because I I will say and we talked about this a lot we want to keep the positivity level high even when the topics are not as you know happy and we started off with the first few episodes with some topics about you know finding the ability to love yourself and even when you don't love the situation and just working around those things so if you haven't already go back and listen to some of those earlier episodes because I really do think that some of that care that we talk about if if it doesn't show them please let me know so that we can go back and re-record all of them over again I think Kathy's saying no on that one okay anyway moving on our our last connection for the week is from Izzy who I will say Izzy keep it up you're you're you're being very friendly to the show and I love it but I have a nickname there my connection for the near future is a simple one to start going on daily walks again and spend more time outside now that the weather is cooling down thanks Texas upside down smiley face I'm not sure I'm not sure about the shade you threw there maybe that's why it's cooling down a bit um but Izzy I love this I've recently started going on walks myself I think someone else was going on walks too um so by all means I this is wonderful those walks those daily walks that's that time alone that time alone with you one of my favorite songs by Justin Collier or not Justin Collier Jacob Collier who I will I will put that song in the uh in the chat as well or in the in the chat my goodness I didn't say no to myself in talking uh wow I will put a link in the show notes to that song because I feel like it is such a great and wonderful walking song I think that's fantastic being able to take that time for yourself and and enjoying the outside when it's not actively trying to kill you uh for a little bit before it gets uh worse as is great we finally have rain back here in the Pacific Northwest and my heart is very happy but it does mean that uh it's harder to spend time outside but I'm still working on on finding that time to spend outside when I can I love it Kathy we've we've done a lot and I'm afraid to ask the next question because we've talked about saying no so much uh but at some point the show's got it in so I'm just gonna say Kathy did did we do it yeah Jay we can't did it
