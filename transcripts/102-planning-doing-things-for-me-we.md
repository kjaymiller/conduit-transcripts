From Relay F.O., you're listening to Conduette, the show we Condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduette, the show that brightens up your day. Regardless of what we talked about beforehand. Definitely, all bright and happy and cheery here.
This episode is brought to you by Computex, Micro.Blog, and Vitaly. I'm Jay, product evangelist at Ivan, and with me is the Internet's Unicorn. Or what is it, the Busyness Unicorn of the Internet, the one Kathy Campbell. Hey Kathy, how are you? Hi, I am here and mostly recovered, which is great.
That is good. Well folks, we do a lot. This is the show. We're going to do that show. We're off to a weird start already. What happened last week in the Discord, Kathy? Lots of things happened.
Lots of conversations about AI and a wide variety of, you know, how have funny jokes that always happen, including where I was spotted in the background of somebody's YouTube video in Computex, and it became like the big put meme of me walking, because I was out of focus and stuff.
Yeah, it was good times. Awesome. And I would tell you what we did in the co-working session, but there wasn't one. We didn't have one. Because Kathy was in Taiwan, which... Flex. Yep. Sorry. And I was in Pittsburgh.
There was really interesting trips, although I will say Kathy, I have been to the home of the Pittsburgh Pirates, Pittsburgh's baseball team, and very small, well, very interesting baseball park, but it has one of the prettiest backdrops, which is the city of Pittsburgh behind it.
So I know you're not a sports fan, but I'm sure you are a fan of really like beautiful imagery. Yes. I will remind myself to send you a photo of the backdrop in Pittsburgh, because I do think that you would appreciate it. Yes, please. Love that.
But yeah, for those that don't know, Conduwa is an accountability show where we hold each other accountable, and we talk about the realness that comes with productivity things.
If the discord and the co-working sessions, and on top of that, all of that accountability fun stuff, is something that you think that you would enjoy, then consider becoming a super conductor.
 You not only get access to all those things, but you get access to the pre and post show where in this pre show, we talked about our memorial days, where one of them, one person's memorial days will spend catching up on sleep, and the other person's memorial day was busy complaining about hotel choice.
I wonder who's was who's. I know. So weird. If that sounds like fun to you, question your decisions, but then also go to I'm a super conductor.com. Let her I letter M letter A super conductor dot com.
Kathy, do we have any shout outs? Shout out to all of our amazing people that do the things that they do. Our editor is amazing. Our super conductors are amazing. The discordians are amazing. The discordians. Yes. It's pretty great.
But also I just, I am really appreciative to the community that we have. So thanks. Yes, shout out to all of them. Also shout out to the people that made me feel super welcome who told me that they listen to me. I listen to conduit while I was at Pittsburgh while I was at Pike on US.
I always tell people it's I get really awkward when my communities like converge. So hearing people go, oh, hey, that episode one like people were congratulating us on 100 episodes.
People were we're talking about like latest episodes and the the series is around the burnout series and like all this other stuff that we've been talking about. I don't want to say any particular names because there were a few of you and I'll be honest I have forgotten some. It was a blur.
Pittsburgh was very much a blur against spite of all the other things happening, which I will talk about in detail soon. But yeah, like I can't say that enough. Thank you so much for just coming up to me and being like, hey, I listen to conduit and it's it was you know it was.
It made me feel like you know what we're doing is super important because it is. Yeah, that's that's amazing. I don't have like people don't really come up to me and tell me they listen to the show, which is great. Because I don't know how I would take that.
But I forget that people listen to this sometimes, which is weird. Like people are hearing what I'm saying and that's that's strange to me. There is the like words words don't count until you know that someone has actually acknowledged their existence.
You know what and I'm okay with just talking to my friend Jay. Yeah, sometimes enemy my friend of me, Jay, that's all good. Regardless of the half a million downloads we've received. Listen, I can't I can't I love you all, but I can't think about you. Yeah, that's fine.
You're all invisible, but very, very present in our hearts. Yes, yes. Anyway, another thing that's great is our first sponsor Kathy. Take it away. Yeah, yeah. So this episode of conduit is brought to you by Computex Computex 2025 was a complete. Success.
The major global technology exhibition in Taipei had over 85,000 buyers from 152 different countries. And I met a lot of them. Okay, not really. I didn't meet a 10 of them. But I did. So I was a little bit worried about going by myself this year because Rosemary didn't go and silly me.
I forget that I will talk to inanimate objects and the fact that I made friends was not a. I was surprised, but amazing. So I got to spend a lot of time with a lovely lady from France, a lovely lady from the UK, and two gentlemen from New York City that didn't know each other ahead of time.
And we got to kind of experience the show together and it was really great to kind of experience all of the like different aspects of it from different. Different, like people, like seeing things differently through different eyes. So I am clear. I am not a big, you know, I'm not a tech reporter.
I do my stuff the way that I do, but it's very different from somebody who like writes tech articles all the time.
And so it was really neat being able to like go to some of the keynotes and the press conference and all of that stuff and sit next to people that knew kind of what was going on and also look at some of the things in the trade show area with people that understood.
There were also like lots of really cool creative things that people produced, one of which I brought home and a couple things that I have on my list to buy that were some really cute, like a cute little cat, like battery charger. Charger. So it has the little cat. It was freaking adorable.
I need to find the link so that I could add it into the show notes, but something I brought home for my kiddo was a mug for like traveling with tea. So it has like the little basket that you put a tea in.
And then the bottom of it has not I'm going to call it a section cup, but it's not really a section cup. But it basically makes it so it doesn't knock over. And in my mind, I was like, this is something that Casey listen needs so that he doesn't, you know, spill in his keyboard or computer again.
But it was great because I like there are so many creative people in the world and the things that they produce are really incredible. I was a little. So last year several of the talks discussing about AI also discuss kind of being aware of the environmental and ethical aspect of it.
And I will say my communications that I talked to people that went to every like multiple things. There wasn't as much there was no discussion of that this year, which made me a little bit sad, especially since the theme was AI next.
So some of the keynote speakers included Jensen Huang on accelerated computing and a genetic AI. And he was apparently like a rock star. There were so many videos of people like he had like six bodyguards when he was walking through the trade show area to keep the people away from him.
It was madness watching him try and make his way through the area. Christiano Amon on edge AI for mobile, automated and computing and Dr. Rick Tsai on AI computing from edge to cloud and more.
You know, Vex, the launch pad for business growth and professional developments celebrated their 10th anniversary at Computex 2025.
The winner of their pitch contest was deep rad dot AI from Taiwan for their use of AI in early disease detection and in other winner news, Computex awarded the sustainable design award to pegatron. If you missed out on Computex 2025, don't worry because Computex 2026 is already in the works.
The Computex 2026 dates are June 2nd through the 5th in 2026.
Due to popular demand, the show will expand into an additional two halls at the Taipei Nhinggung exhibition center, which means it's going to be even like it already is like four floors and one and two floors at another of the exhibition center.
So the fact that they're adding two additional halls means it's going to be massive and you can expect an even larger showcase of AI powered tech and lifestyle innovation. Computex continues to lead the global conversation on AI startups and innovation.
So be a part of it and visit Computex Taipei dot com dot TWO for more information. That's Computex Taipei dot com dot TWO for all the information on Computex 2026. Our thanks to Computex for their support of the show and all of relay.
Kathy, I wanted to just let you know that while you were learning about all this AI goodness, I had literally one of the funniest moments in the history of conferencing ever happened. Oh, it was so good. It was so amazing. Like I was 100% here for it. So I was at Pike on US.
And which they were doing the early introductions. I welcome. We're so happy to be here in Pittsburgh. Here's all the things. And then right before they go to the first speaker, they're like, okay, we're going to have one of our platinum sponsors, which is Google, you know, come up and talk.
And like so someone from Google comes up and they're like, you know, hybrid Google. We're hiring. We love the Python community. It's so great. And you know, we're so happy to be a part of it and like all this stuff.
So then they announced the first keynote speaker, which is none other than Corey doctor. And Corey doctor gets up. And real quick, because I definitely know who that is. But for anyone in our audience that doesn't.
Corey doctor is a science fiction author and the inventor of the phrase in shinnification. Okay, love that. And proceeded to give like the first words were I'm going to tell you about how the healthcare system is completely jacked up. But also it's not the healthcare systems fault. It's Googles.
 It begins to go into a 45 minute, like just derailing of here's why big companies in name specifically all of the big companies that sponsor dissavets are like the worst thing that has happened to the internet and how we can like slowly but surely reclaim our existence from like the like neocapitalistic slavery that this these companies have introduced.
As we're all just sitting there wide eyed like, oh, oh he went there very very much. So it sounds like we were at two very different conferences that were like talking about some of the biggest topics in technology. Maybe from different sides. Yeah, but also. Oh my goodness.
Just such a great such a great like juxtaposition of thoughts and ideas. But I'm glad your conference went well. I'm glad yours went well. Yep. And now it's time for the connection check. Kathy, it sounds like you did your thing. I did.
So my connection was to talk about tech as a non techie and I think they're pretty good. I was able to ask questions and come come about this in a little bit of a different way.
I'm not the normal questions and conversations that people had and yeah, it was it was I had a I had a good time and I learned a lot kind of about who I am as a tech journalist. And I use that in major quotes. But more importantly, kind of like what my limits are and I really enjoyed that. Nice.
Well, my connection was to use my remarkable tablet, which we talked a little bit about last episode. And I wanted to I wanted to see what it would be like using this as a way to take notes while at these these kinds of events. Yeah, I'm sold.
Well, we're going to actually talk about it in the the post show more about how sold I am on it. But I was I was really concerned originally that I would get it and be like, ah, this isn't all that great.
But I genuinely have been using it as my primary note taking my journaling my planning like I use it for way more than I initially thought I would use it for. And it honestly, I still think it's too early to decide whether or not it's going to completely revolutionize my way of thinking.
But again, as we'll talk about a little bit in the post show, I definitely see some benefits of of having a digital slash analog tool. Yeah. And your arsenal, especially for those that grew up on analog tools, but want some of the benefits that come with a digital tool as well. I love it.
So yeah, stay tuned to our post show, which you can access. If you're not live, you can access at I am a superconductor.com letter. I letter M letter a superconductor dog home. I love how it becomes more of a song every time. Uh-huh. What about our conductors? Yeah.
So our artists of the show Carly says connection check green circle. I cross stitched most nights before going to bed to unwind and I'm glad I kept it up. I love that. That is fantastic. I also have been cross stitching more often, which is very exciting.
Our identical twin of the show Aaron said green circle had a relaxing time with my family during the Victoria day long weekend. Oh, yeah, awesome. I, I, I too did. But I'm sure no one come no one complained about your complaints on hotel choice Aaron.
So maybe yours was a little bit more relaxing than mine. Yes, our soprano of the show debos says connection check green heart dealt with my husband's old retirement account before a default bad decision was made for us. Congratulations.
Yeah, I think our checklist enthusiasts of the show Mike said checkmark go ship out all the returns and other packages I needed to send all done and credited way to go.
Uh, may zing our code monkey of the show Douglas says connection check green check marks successfully managed first week at new job and keep kept most of my systems in place well done. That's really impressive. It's always nice to be able to keep things in place.
Our fish bear of the show Fichika says green heart. I did carve out time for fun. The challenges to now keep it a regular thing. Yes. Yes. Very much. Yes. Keep up the fun. And the Esperanto nitter of the show, Irrizano says connection check and I'm in route to be our N.O. So green heart for me.
The polyglot gathering starts tomorrow and I'm looking forward to it. Can't wait to hear about it. Kathy, have you ever been to be our N.O.? I don't even know what it is. It's for no. I was thinking it was like listen, there were enough vowels in there for my brain to really like purses.
So it sounded like it was like the initials of like an airport type thing like pdx is what they call you know Portland. So. Well, I don't. Uninformed, but now I am informed. So go me. I guess. It's okay. I probably said it wrong as well.
The robotics engineer of the show Aiden says green heart apparently the weather was insulted that I called it nice because it decided to be cold and wet all last week. Still I braced myself for the worst I managed to take my lunch walks. Oh, that's good job. I'm sorry. I don't know.
I don't know words involved there, but my goodness. I hate. I don't like that you had to sit there in the rain and deal with that. So good job that you did it in spite of me not being happy about it.
Our carl of all trades of the show carl says connection check a green check mark applied for a technology director position in the nearby school district.
This is a small stretch for my resume and step up on the higher archi chart fingers crossed well done applying for a job that you are not like extra like super qualified for like being able to to make that step outside of your box is really impressive. So well done. Yes. Our.
Oh, I figured it out of the show. I said yellow circle. I did not unpack my boxes, but I did clean up my room around them. So they're not as in the way and getting them out of the way was sort of the goal of emptying them. So I'm giving myself half points. Hey, I think that's fair. Um, way to go.
The Oracle of the show. So says connection check a green tree. I added the edit did did did the article and told the author they were brilliant. It helps that they really were brilliant. Yeah, well done. It does seem to help when brilliance is involved. Um, our tech podcast listener of the show.
Pillik said heart didn't do an iOS widget, but did chill and book a day trip to Toronto in August for a concert. Ooh, that sounds fun. Fun. And lastly, the nameless of the show nameless says green circle. I survived church camp.
I'm also glad that I also didn't try to do more than I was able to trusting in the team and made it up there to help. I had a good time and great conversations. Also, I started a free PM course. Yay question mark. Okay. So first off, being able to trust the team is huge.
Um, that's a perfect timing because it's kind of a little bit about our topic, but not really, but sort of, but also, yeah, so well done. Good job. Yes. Speaking of good topics, this episode of conduit is brought to you by micro.blog.

I am now a product evangelist which I would love to tell you what that actually means. But I can't. You're clearly evangelizing the product. So yes, yes, and there's there's a lot of I will say concern around when a developer advocate as myself moves from advocacy to evangelism.
I feel like the words themselves kind of indicate maybe the difference in sentiment from the community. I promise to all of the folks that know me. I intend on still being a strong advocate for the communities that I represent.
The communities that I don't represent but show allyship to and also the individual developers out there in the world that are impacted by the decisions that companies like the one I work for make. It's just now that that is a little bit less of my job and more of my desire.
But all that to say, it's been a whirlwind of change for me in the last year because I've for those that remember about 15 months ago. I started at this company as one of their more senior developer advocates.
It was my job to kind of sit in a leadership position but also strategize and think as one of the more senior folks to help come up with different ideas, different ways for us to engage the community in a way that would be appreciated.
To fast forward earlier this year when there was a decision made that I would be moving into a management position. To now fast forwarding now where literally the team that I was managing has been disbanded. And now we're all scattered across different products.
And I will say that I was reassured that funny enough some of these decisions were already made before I got put into that management position which tells you a lot about how my weekends been.
I think hey we put you in charge of this to basically hold over until we could execute on the bigger goal which didn't involve you being in charge. Hooray, myself a steam goes right up with that but I think it more importantly for the immediate has me shifting my mindset again.
 So I went from being like me on a team of we so me as an individual contributor operating on a team a larger team with team goals team impacts and like all these other things to me being the decision maker for that team so me thinking more about how those individuals operate as like a cohesive unit.
 To now being an individual contributor on basically a team and by myself like I have a boss my boss has you know a vision for what like the overall vision is but I don't really I don't operate with peers I operate with engineers who are doing their role and then my role is to kind of promote the hard work.
 The hard work that they're doing and kind of be the voice and face of that so it's it feels rough to like have that transition so I wanted to kind of talk about this especially with you Kathy because it feels like in many ways you do this on like a micro macro like this different you have a different approach to it but well instead of me trying to describe it to you why don't you describe it to me I don't know.
 I mean I guess so it's so okay for anyone that doesn't know I'm a unicorn which doesn't really mean anything however what I do is I I the easy term for what I do as my main job a job is an online business manager meaning that I help businesses kind of get their stuff together which can take a wide range of like formats it it it's not just one specific thing so like a lot of times people will maybe have a higher higher a social media marketing agency to run their social media or a company that does you know like I know what's it called like sales funnels versus a virtual assistant that maybe does invoicing and and that sort of stuff so we kind of take a little bit outside of that in that we're kind of an overarching helper for the company and we provide services based on what the person needs so it's not about me it's about we in that I individually will do what the company needs the help with and provide feedback and and kind of information based on like the individual needs and support how how it's needed which for example before hopping on for this recording I was helping a client who is pitching a bunch of VCs in California in next week we were working through their deck and I was asking the questions as a non techie as a non person that doesn't do these types of things coming at it in a different way to ask the questions to be like hey first off can we spell the word communication correctly in the screenshots I feel like that's kind of an important and important thing yeah you know spell spell we're words correctly the sad part is this we were editing a deck that had been used multiple times already for different things and and that made me really really sad because this was the first time I had seen it but also like asking asking the questions of like what are what message are you trying to send because that's going to determine like what sort of information is shared here and so I'm coming my job is basically using what's in my head to support other people and the things that they do to ask the weird questions to do the to do the things to support in a way that is kind of hard to get especially if you're running a business and this is the first time you've run a small business you also have like the you know you have a team of unicorns that you have to think about and you have like a cadre of clients I don't know if I use the word cadre right there but I really hope I did we'll say yes why not but like you you are having to shift your focus and I think this is a thing that you know we talk about or I guess when you talk about the idea of being a founder versus being someone who is like a CEO and maybe like some of the problems that I guess founders and CEOs run into of like shifting your focus from the needs as maybe a product person to the needs of like a business person yeah I think about this with the nonprofit that I run I've been saying this a lot over the last week because the event that I went to is also the time where I get together with that team and we kind of plan out the rest of the year you know at some point we have to go from a group of developers to a nod to a nonprofit that supports a group of developers and you know that's one of those things that I feel like everyone is really afraid of but it's ultimately a requirement and I think that's where you know some of the interesting kind of thoughts that I'm having at the moment are taking root is I'm I'm now maybe for the first time in my career not thinking about how does my career directly impact my immediate team as I look at my my previous roles I was always one of the developer types so you know we would have this project or we would have this scope that we would want to work around and in doing that it was always like hey Jake can you build the proof of concept for this can you can you build out the thing in which you know we will work on as a team to kind of as like the backbone of what we're going to be talking about what we're going to be sharing and I mean I will say that there is some of that but it's not necessarily me making it and then going back to the team and going here you go it's me making that for myself and being like okay great now I have this thing that I can use for me and me only that I have to maintain that I have to be like the sole maintainer for now what do I do with it but there is also the role of you know thinking about social media presence again that something that I've kind of stopped doing as of lately just because social media has become it's not a place that I want to be on nearly as much but my job now is to be a brand it's it's to have some brand recognition and that's something that I you know I've got to think about I've got to think about how I'm going to approach that differently whereas before a lot of it was like hey people who do like social media y'all go do the social media thing I'm going to stick back here in the hole and maybe build more stuff.
 Yeah yeah it's a different it's a different mindset for sure I know one of one of the the things that I do when I start working with a new person especially one that is very new to asking for help is is working through that process of doing the hard things and trusting another person a lot of times somebody that has started their business and it's themselves or maybe you know their buddy from college or whatever they're starting a company and they've made it to a point where somehow they they hit that that window of this is a need this is somebody that has found their niche and and has has most of the time with the company has most of the time like grown fairly quickly to the point where they don't really know what they need help with necessarily because it comes to a point where it's really difficult for them to give things up because they've done everything you know however long they've they've been working whether it's you know a six month thing or you know they've been running this business for years and it comes down to the fact of like you can't do it all yourself anymore and that means you have to trust people but not only do you have to trust people but you have to communicate in a way that will get across the parts that are really important to you.
One of the companies that were currently helping has just kind of exploded from the help that we've been giving them to the point where in the last three months they have a list of POs that basically has made more than they had made all of last year. Which is great.
You said exploded and I was like oh no no no in a good way in a good way in a good way the difficult part is trying to change the owner's mindset on what needs to happen. One of the easy things that we did was telling him to turn off the ringer of his phone. He has a landline which is fine.
The problem is is that I would say 98% of the phone calls are spam. Which means he does not need to stop what he's doing to answer the phone. Yep. You can use your voicemail to screen the calls. Nothing that they do is an emergency.
No one's life is on the line where they need to be able to answer this call. But not only that there are many many things that he is the only one that can do. He needs to be doing the things that only he can do. Everything else can be managed by other people.
We can do things but he needs to not do them first. It has been a journey in the last few months to try and process that and help him understand that we're not saying he's doing a bad job. We're not telling him that he's not useful in this space anymore but that his time is better spent elsewhere.
You do not need to answer the phone every time it rings. Please don't answer the phone at all because it's taking you out of the work that you are doing. That's the show title. Don't answer the phone at all. That's the clickbait productivity advice that we have to use. Don't answer the phone.
I was like, do I have to? Yes. Why? First off, I don't interact with the clients to the point where they're going to need to call me. Can I charge you an extra for this? Yes. I get notifications when a voicemail is left which so far apparently the number that I have used to be for a car sales lot.
I have lots of people calling to say that they are bringing the car and I'm like this is not helping. This is not what I need but that's fine. It's funny because it sounds like a lot of what you're trying to convince your clients of like hey.
It's funny because you mentioned there are some things that only they can do. My immediate thought was how do you make it so that they're not the only people that can do that thing anymore? I love how you put it. It's not that you're doing a bad job.
You have to think differently now given the growth of your company. What happens if you get sick and you're the only person that can do this thing? What happens if you win the lottery which sounds like you may have with the explosion of things? You're just no longer available to do this.
What happens if there's something bad that happens and you're away from the business for some time. Medical things happen. There's so many little things that could happen that because of the change in scope.
You now have to think about and be prepared for and that's one of the things that I'm struggling with the most at the moment is how do I approach things differently knowing that where I used to have a team of people that I was building for, relying on, relying towards I guess or working towards.
Now I don't have that and a lot of what I'm doing is going to be very much a I control the scope, I control the space, I control the direction and the conversations. There is a lot of it that just sits now more on me and it's not even necessarily that I want it to be.
This is just the new reality of the role that I'm in. Yeah, that can get really lonely and exhausting. It's definitely something to be aware of and see how you can find that support that you need to.
Yeah, I'm glad that you are thinking about it now and aware of it because that will better help you not to burn out or be surprised when stuff happens that can negatively affect things. I don't have a solution for you unfortunately, but good luck.
I would be interested in what's the solution that you have for your clients in some ways.
Do you just sit them down and you can't be the bottleneck? I think what I'm trying to do now is see the problems before they're going to happen and then let my boss know, hey, just given the nature of this new working setup, here are some of the problems that I predict will happen.
Here are my ideas for working towards preventing those, but also I'm totally on board if you have some other ideas. It sounds like my boss is very much like I've never had to manage someone in this role. I don't really know.
Neither were both new in this space and the person that put us in this space is also kind of new in this space.
There is a lot of like, hey, how much time do I have realistically to acclimate to this new setup, how much forgiveness and leniency, and then also let me just understand what your needs are.
I was really trying to channel like the first conversation I had with the one Kathy Campbell, which was just like, hey, look, if I'm going to be doing some so far unidentified work for you, it would be really helpful.
I've got a clear understanding of what your goals are in this department so that I can one protect those goals at all costs, but also make sure that I'm creating sustainable ideas and concepts for what you're trying to achieve.
It's important to know that so that you can have these benchmarks for learning what happens if you've quote unquote failed. So you're not having a follow-up meeting where they're like, hey, you didn't do these reports correctly to what you go, what reports nobody told me anything about reports.
Like by having these open, because really communication is key, this is my tagline for life is that you need to be openly communicating and that includes the difficult conversation sometimes.
And part of that is, hey, I need to make sure that your expectations that you have are communicated so that I can meet them or at least be aware of them, because guess what, can't read minds yet.
I need to know it's just like any sort of relationships that you have, you need to be willing and able to have the somewhat possibly difficult conversations in order to better get things processed.
So yeah, having a sit, well, first off, I would take some time to base off of the information that you currently know.
What is your job outlines, what are the goals, what are the purpose for the future, et cetera, what as you currently understand it, knowing that this is not going to be perfect and that it's going to probably be changing and more fitting in the future.
But being able to sit down and be like, hey, we need to do this. And then you can talk to them and be like, hey, here's where I think we are based on previous conversations. This is what I am expecting my purpose to be. This is what this role is.
This is where, like, what benchmarks, KPIs, insert, fun, business, we weren't here.
 Yeah, this is my understanding where have I missed the mark, what pieces am I not sure of, like, what is happening and what is like what is going on to make sure that we're on the same page so that there are no surprises when review time comes or when, you know, this project is going to be launching or changing or more.
Or changing or morphing or adjusting or whatever, which I think would also be beneficial for them since you said that they are new in this too.
Like you're showing a sense of, like, leadership and ideas to, like, be really, that could be really powerful to be able to give the feedback that they need to make sure in the future this role is better defined.
And I think that there is on top of that, like, setting expectations to avoid kind of the negative consequences. There is a lot of setting the, setting the consequence of, like, inability to, I don't want to say manage, but inability to expectation set. Yeah.
Where there's like the, hey, I just want you to know, here's what I'm thinking and I can only go off of this until I have your guidance. So like, you know what I'm going to be doing.
It's like you, you know where I'm, my head is, my head is currently at and you know where I'm like pointing towards when it comes to what my next steps, what I think my next steps should be.
So if there, like, if there is any, anything here that is just clearly wrong, like say something, even if you don't know what's right, like, at least tell me what's wrong. And then that way I can, I can avoid that. Because again, you cannot read their minds.
They may have been having, you know, meetings with whatever C-suite people that have these ideas for what this role is and what the purpose and what the goals are. But if you don't know what they are, you can't tailor and craft what you're doing to meet that.
And it's impossible for you to read their mind. And so, unfortunately, a lot of times people in charge don't get that necessarily don't really understand.
And so it's important to make sure that you're asking for what you need and that includes, like, clarification and ideas and information that you actually need to see.
 Well, and I guess before we wrap up on this thought, I wanted the Kathy Campbell trusted tried and true to method for kind of switching context from someone who is doing work for another person as like an individual versus someone who then has to shift their focus to Kathy Campbell, the business owner, who's managing people and needs and consensus.
I wish I had a trick. I think, okay, so this is, I don't have an easy way to do this because it's kind of just how my brain works. But one thing that I do is I do try to have context clues so that my brain defaults to knowing kind of what it's doing.
So like, for example, I only use Chrome for relay work. So if I'm in Chrome, I know it's because I'm doing relay stuff. Obviously, there are not enough browsers for me to do like different client work and different things. I feel bad for your client that stuck on that scavenger navigator. Right.
I'm using Internet Explorer 6. I can't do that. Right. That'd be hilarious. But what I will say is that sometimes having, you know, making sure that stuff is different colors. So like my calendar events, I have different colors for different clients, different like mindset.
So when I look at my calendar, I know, okay, this is going to be this type of work because it's this color. It just kind of is a default in that in that brain space. And the same for like the different Google accounts that I use for my different clients. They're all different colors.
Like different priorities. I know you can do that in different spaces to like have like the backdrop makes different colors and stuff. I don't need to go that far necessarily, but like it depends on how your brain works.
And obviously if you're colorblind or whatever, you're going to have a harder time, you know, doing those color changes. But that kind of helps default my brain into the right space, I guess. I know some people will do things like sit in different locations for specific work.
I do too much switching throughout the day, but there's some people that do time blocking in the project based side of things.
So that might be something that you could work like if you're doing this type of thing, you're going to sit in a specific spot or you're going to have a different, I don't know, hat that you're going to wear while you're working on something. You want to go by hats. Yeah, go by hats.
Like if you're wearing your Chicago Cubs hat, you're going to work on something. I don't know. I'm just proud of you that you highlight the Chicago Cubs. Welcome. That's a, that's a definitely a baseball team. It is. Woo! Go me. I am a sports girly or something.
Future goal we have, we have Kathy like do like a baseball podcast. Oh my god. No. I would have to be paid so much money. What mean is like a relay maybe for like Saint Judah or something? Okay. Do I have to? I mean, we've done worse. Yes, no, that is very true. That is very, very true.
We give video of Kathy going to a bad engage. Listen, sure. I have no problem. I have no problem with in-person sports ball things. I love the spectacle of events in person. But don't make me watch it on TV because that is so boring. Very, very fair.
I think with this, you kind of, you did kind of tease on something that I was not necessarily thinking completely about but maybe thinking about in a different way. I have talked about my disdain for time blocking. Maybe it's because it just doesn't work for me.
I can't block myself into focusing on one thing for a limited amount of time because it might take me that long just to effectively like switch my focus to it. But I do tend to have this, like, I don't know what the phrasing is for. I can batch days relatively well. There you go.
I can go like, you know, I know what my needs are for like a Monday versus like, I know what my meetings are. I've actually tried to do this in some ways where like Tuesdays and Thursdays are my busiest meeting days, which means that Monday Wednesday and Friday I'm lighter on meetings.
And Friday tends to be my community day because why not have fun before I'm about to go off for the weekend. So there's a lot of like, not necessarily changing my context during the day.
But I am lucky enough to be able to say like, all right, I can really focus in on certain tasks during different days of the week and then use the, hey, I need someone to review this as like my excuse as for why I don't think about it until the following week as a thing.
I mean, not to break your brain a little bit, but that is time batching. No, no, Kathy, no, it's not. It's something completely different. I refuse. Okay. Okay. If it is, my brain will reject it immediately. Okay. Well, then no, it's definitely not. But you're having theme days. Exactly.
Theme days. There you go. That's way more fun. It's like what my kid has at school. Exactly. So one of these days is superhero days. So make sure to wear your cape. Yep. And I wear my Chicago Cubs jersey because I don't have a Chicago Cubs hat yet.
Yeah, lots of lots of different ways to think about it for sure. And I like that idea. And by having that set in quote unquote stone, it means it's easier for you to tell your other people when you're working on things or what, you know, oh, well Tuesday, Thursdays are my meeting days.
So don't ask for a meeting on my day. Obviously, if it's your superior or whatever you can't deal with it, that's one thing. Okay. Let's schedule this. These are my days for X. So make sure it fits in that window of time so that you can fulfill the needs that are needed for that. Yeah.
And there is often like the, hey, I'm going to need to execute on something and then get back the results to you. Can we meet on insert day that is just normally my meeting days anyway? Yep.
That way I'm not going, yeah, because my favorite is always when they go, oh, yeah, let's talk about it next week and then they schedule it for like next Monday. And I'm like, can we, can we like maybe book this out a little bit further away from Monday? Yeah.
And that just grants me more time to actively work within the boundaries of how I would normally work versus trying to wedge something in that would cause, you know, some disruption. Yeah. And being able to have that communication is important for your sanity.
But also like, hey, my meeting days are, you know, Tuesdays are when I work on this. So that's when if it works for you, because just like so is saying in the chat, they also try to have theme days and the job description makes it possible.
But people keep organizing meetings for Thursday projects on Tuesdays, etc. Like obviously you have to be flexible at some points for when you work with other people. That's just how it goes. But anything that you can do to make it easier on everybody, you should definitely try to do. Yeah.
And I do think that there is like a, like you said, kind of setting that expectation. That was one of the first things that I did mention to my boss was like, hey, you know, he had mentioned something about meeting on like a Friday. And I was like, that's fine.
But can we make it like early Friday morning, my time that way, you know, usually Fridays are my days where I'm like really invested in like community work and things like that. And it was like, oh, yeah, no problem. And it was literally just a shifting of a calendar event that was just made.
So like sometimes it's like, yeah, there are, there are people that will often want to schedule a thing. And like, they're not, they're not scheduling it particularly at that time in spite of you.
If they're using something like Google, it's literally like they're just putting in your name and then picking the first spot that seemed available. Yeah, none of this, most of the time, I hate to tell you this, most of the time it's not a deep thought.
Most of the time people aren't thinking about you that much, which is why you have to set those boundaries and like just like you said, hey, you know, Fridays are normally my community days. Can we do it earlier? Oh, yeah, sure, no problem.
Again, you're communicating the needs because not only can you not read their mind, but they can't read your mind. Yep. And it's okay to set those boundaries in place and set those, those needs. 100%. Speaking of needs, we need to think our next sponsor. Kathy, take it away.

So Kathy, what do you feel like you will be doing in the next conduit? I really need to clean up my desk desk space and that involves getting rid of the stuff that I don't need on my desk. I came back from Taiwan and was just like, oh no, because I left my office a complete disaster.
And the biggest thing that I need to do is definitely start with my desk because it's a disaster. It's a disaster. When I switched to my standing desk, I have much fewer storage solutions in my desk because I went from a two file cabinet desk to I now have this tiny little drawer.
And now so I've had this desk for long enough to where I'm like, okay, I kind of know how I'm using it, what I'm using the space for, et cetera, et cetera. I feel like I can kind of work through some solutions. So I am going to clean up my desk. I like that.
I almost I almost had it and I was like, Kathy, 3D print a new desk or at least a new drawer. 3D print a new drawer. That way you have another drawer to go into. With the 3D printers that I don't have? Hey, that's that is a problem that is easily fixable. I'm sure between the break through.
And where am I going to put this 3D printer because I definitely do not have space to have a 3D printer anywhere in my house? Yeah, I can't grab by new house. I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah, you 3D print me a house and that'll be set. And there are 3D printers that can make houses. Yeah, I know.
Funny enough, I had an idea for a connection and I lost it. It's gone. And it's written it down. I should have instead of doodling so I could pay attention to what you were saying.
I did take a couple of notes and one of the notes that I did have in here was doing the hard things and trusting other people. I have to identify what's my work and what's not my work. Yes. So I think what I'm going to do that I know I've already started on is I have meetings with people.
I am going to make a document for myself that just says this person does this thing. And that person won't be me. And maybe I also improve on that document and say this is what I do. So this is what I should do. This is what I should be responsible for.
And this is what other people are responsible for. At least to make that document, I could go to my boss and my boss go, well, no, we actually want you to be responsible for this. And I'm like, okay, cool. That's fair. I think that's a great idea. Setting up those expectations for yourself.
And so you're not answering the phone, even though like the metaphorical phone, you're doing the pieces that you need to do. Not the things that you think that you're supposed to be doing. Yes. Yeah, I definitely think that that's something that I can tackle.
If only I will write it down so I don't forget. Yeah, thank you for filling out your connection into the document. So I don't have to ask you on Thursday. Hey, Jay. I don't know what you're talking about, Kathy. What was your... Yeah, definitely. It doesn't ever happen.
What do our conductors want to do? That's the real question. Yeah. Our artist of the show, Carly, says, start looking for my next opportunity. I'm working a temp job that is supposed to end on June 27th. I want to have something lined up after that. Good plan.
Our identical twin of the show, Aaron says, freelancing wills keep on turning. So I'm looking to keep things at a regular cadence while saying no too much. Well, wait, by saying no to too much. Yeah, no too too much. Okay. You can do that, Aaron. I believe in you.
Our soprano of the show demos says, next connection, the sort through one drawer of clothing. Good luck. Good luck. Our checklist enthusiast of the show, Mike, says, clean up my personal task list and get some projects off of it. Yes. That's a...
Our code monkey of the show Douglas says, new connection. Get more of my backlog cleared and keep the progress going. Yes, chug along. Chuchu. Cat something about Kathy singing that one song from the 90s. Come on, ride the train. Yep, yep, yep. And ride it. Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
Our fish bear of the show, Fishy Kai says, the kids last day of school is coming up and I need to make sure we are prepared for summer break as possible. Hey, my kids summer break just started last week.
So I'm right there with you in the like, how do I keep this kid entertained? Yeah, I don't have that much of a problem. It is, well, we still have a couple weeks of school, but that's fine.
The Esperanto Nitter of the show, Irizzanio says, after realizing I still have a limited amount of non-moth eaten socks, I quickly grabbed my sock knitting for my trip and while traveling and knitting, I realized it helped a lot with staying more grounded.
So for my next connection, I want to finish two pairs of socks. Oh, yes. Well done. I like that. Our robotics engineer of the show, Aiden says, back to car work. I need to call the mechanic to get my socks looked at. Oh, I mean, these cars, they never, they never end. I know. It's the worst.
Our carl of all trades of the show carls has next connection. Keep applying for jobs. Yes, you can do it. Our, ah, of the show, ah, says, I've got a Southeast Asia trip coming up next month. My flight is booked, but nothing else. So I need to spend some time planning. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, probably should, should do that. Our Oracle of the show, so says it's time to try and figure out exercise again. I move my recumbent exercise bike out of my garage and into my living room. Now, I want to use it at least three times a week on top of my usual swimming. Good job.
Our tech podcast listener of the show, Pillik says, ah, hope for Mrs. Pillik. She just had an interview and it went great. So now we hope for a job offer. Um, good luck in all the hoping that that you're going to do. We, we will hope along with you.
And lastly, the nameless of the show nameless says new connection work on the youth conference. It's coming up in less than a month. I need to finalize the schedule and talks. I keep trying to do more and losing time on non essentials. Oh, goodness. Yeah. Yeah. Good luck.
I also saw in the chat that nameless also said that similar to my connection, making that list of who should be doing what and maybe, maybe for himself, who, what he shouldn't be doing. Yeah. Yeah.
