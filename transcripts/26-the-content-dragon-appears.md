From Relay F.O. you're listening to Conduot. The show we Condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduot. The show that reaches for the sky when you're stuck on the ground. The show is brought to you by SetApp. I'm Jay, Senior Cloud Advocate at Microsoft.
And with me is not our usual unicorn. Kathy is taking some time away given all of the stuff just happening in life and around things. So make sure you send unicorns and hearts her way. But I did manage to call in one of my favorite podcasters on the internet right now.
The host of FMD also noticed by my dragon and a new show that we're going to talk about. The one the only sky. Hi sky. Good morning. Are you proud of yourself for that joke? Because I thought it was a good joke. But the yes. The fun. I had to think on my feet.
You could say we're trying to elevate the show a little higher. Anyway, let's jump into shout outs. Sky, I think that you had a very good shout out. So I think it's the only shout out. We're going to talk about other stuff too later on. So take it away. So it's my only shout out.
But this was mentioned on upgrade this week. And I think it's an important thing to mention. AbortionFunds.org. This week has been very stressful for a lot of people in the US. And a lot of people outside the US honestly are sort of fundamental human rights have been attacked.
And in order to fight back against this, there might not seem like there's a lot we can do. And sometimes there isn't a lot that we can do. But right now, I think the most important thing is to donate what you can, you know. Be an activist, be out there.
And a good, very good website that I've seen is abortionFunds.org. So go there. There will be a link. I think there will be a link in the shout outs. So check it out. I believe personally abortion is healthcare. And bodily autonomy should be a fundamental human right.
And so if you disagree with me, so be it. But that's my belief. And I think that's a lot of our beliefs in this community. But so abortionFunds.org. Check it out. And that's all I've got to say about that. I would be super sassy, but that's what rocket is for, I guess.
But no, you're right, a thousand percent. Abortion rights are healthcare. Abortion is healthcare. There are a lot of reasons that people choose to do things. Whether we agree with them or not is one, not our business to be quite clear.
And as a parent, I do everything in my power to one to educate my child that people do things for whatever reasons they choose to do them. And it's not our position or our place to question them and or limit them in any way possible. So that being said, yes, I second abortionFunds.org.
And also if you know somebody that is impacted by this, give them a hug. Like I think there's not enough, I mean with consent, of course, I think there's not enough personal outreach to those folks that are affected most in these moments.
And I think while we're all upset or feeling whichever way about how politics have gone, let's not think about the politics of it. Let's think about the humanity of it and let's think about inhumanity those human beings. So yeah, you know somebody give them a hug, do what you can to support them.
As I always tell people if you're not sure how to help, ask how you can help and do the exact thing that they tell you and nothing else. And if you feel like doing more, ask how you can help them more. That said, let's move on.
I'm going to update our, or I'm going to caveat our doc a little bit and jump to a thing that we just did recently, which was our really FM membership episode.
The Roboconduism, it was absolutely a blast to get on a show with Tiff Armand, Julius Scott, Alex Cox, and of course Kathy and play a game that I think it would be taboo to say its name. But we had a great time. And if you are a relay fan member, then absolutely go check it out.
You will learn that that J is not that great at these kinds of games because I live in my own little bubble sometimes. And of course, yes, when to quote Steve and our follow up, here's a special little bit here. The topic was, I don't remember what the topic, oh, the topic was high coup.
The clue was specific to a culture that certain white men get very obsessed with. And J's answer was jam bands. That's not that answer. It's really not. And given that I know some of the favorite musical types of people in the family kind of made sense to me.
But I will say that ultimately it was a blast. So if you are, like I said, if you're a relay FM member or you want to become a relay FM member, go to relay.fm slash conduit, become a member there, and then go download the whatever that show is. I'm waiting for the live chat to update me crossover.
I keep on to call it crossfire, which is a 90s toy. And that commercial popped into my head. But yeah, the crossover channel and then or the crossover feed. And then from there you can listen to it as well as many other great episodes of this summer's relay FM membership drive.
Yeah, the episode was honestly really good. It was fun. I never imagined that putting all four or five of these people into a podcast together would be as funny and chaotic as it was. But I had to be careful because I was laughing out loud in public. And that's never a good.
I mean, that's a great sign for a podcast, but it's never a fun thing to be that that one weirdo laughing out loud in the middle of a restaurant. So yeah, but you know, it was a very good show. I was sincerely I was sincerely worried about my health during that.
Yeah, because again, when I have a Vasil Vagelsinkope so when I laugh too hard, I pass out. And while that's funny and it is funny when it happens, it scares people the first time.
So yeah, just some some more like feedback and follow up on that we had some stuff from a jumbo who says came for the chaos and boy, this bonus show delivered. I would like a bonus show of just Kathy trying to count up points for game shows. Yes, I think that would that would also be fun.
Just listen to couldn't agree more what's what's in the shows in the show from Maddie V. And when you make money supposedly you get a lot of good capitalism.
And that's a quote from Alex from so and from our train enthusiast of the show Dave Ralezy Brown says I did not expect the phase or the phrase hint high and power bottom to be said, but it happened. I hope Stephen doesn't hear the podcast.
So I was I was I was thinking there was some not really safe words said on that show. So what's in the show was in the show. That said, let's let's turn let's turn our focus a little more to you. For those that don't know sky like give people the the better introduction to who you are.
So my name is Skylar blue. I think if I were to describe what I do. So like my my actual job. Well right now I'm a university student. I'm an undergraduate studying mechanical engineering. But that's not what most people on the internet know me for. I make a couple podcasts.
One as was mentioned earlier, one was find my dragon or one is find my dragon still make it. But it's a show where me and a friend just talk about random things. And that's fun. But I just started a new show. And actually before I get to that, I just repaid my website.
It's at I can remember the address to my own website. I just remade my website. It's skylar blue dot net. There you can find, you know, an about me page or everything that I do and my blog because sometimes I write.
But new podcast that I started recently, which is actually what pushed me to, you know, remake my website. And it's a one person show. And it's scripted, but it's a three minute ish episodic podcast where I just give random facts about random things.
And I just realized the first just released the first episode. And it was about the presidents of the United States. So if you're interested in that you can find the podcast at random facts pod.net. Or you can just find everything that I do at my website. And so that's that's a little bit about me.
But I think if I were to define what I do in the context of the internet, it would be specifically I like to call myself a content creator. Whether or not I'm really a professional is debatable, but I create content. So I'm a content creator. So that's that's a bit about me.
I love that you like to call yourself a content creator since most content creators eight to call themselves content creators. Yeah. Yeah. We were debating in break room, but it should be called and someone someone came up with content chef.
Because because on the other end, people like we called content munchered content munchers. And I came up with content artisan, which someone said sounded too much like a con artist, which I said was on purpose. So yeah. But no, I create content. So might as well.
Well, we're going to be talking a lot about the idea of creating content and kind of where we are in those spaces. But I tell people I embrace the term influencer because I understand that what I do brings about influence in some ways.
And it's my responsibility to take that seriously and also use it for good and not for ill. But before we get to any of our topics, I forgot to ask you, are you okay with the zap? Because it is time for the connection check. Do you want me to do the zap? I would be offended if you didn't zap.
There we go. I love it. I had to think about it like, okay, how order because Norway go, Kathy, what do we do? But Kathy did say a big red X, which we know is not allowed. The Super the show says they haven't touched anything in the office. And that's okay.
I think we will give everybody a pass if things kind of got uprooted this past fortnight because a lot of things got uprooted. And that's, it's just definitely not a time to be complaining about some of the things that we weren't able to accomplish. So Kathy, it's okay.
We know you can't do it in your time and we still love you. But what about you, Sky? Last week I said I was going to prepare a bit for the next semester of university. I prepared a tiny bit, which I guess counts, but I'm giving myself sort of the yellow light on this one.
Only because I'm deferring it to a later date, because extended, I've got extended family in town and other sort of summer vacation things are happening. So I was a little bit busy unexpectedly this last couple of weeks, so I didn't end up doing as much preparation as I wanted to.
But the next semester doesn't start until August. And it's not even July. So sort of said, like I've got the entire month of July to work on this. So it's a yellow light or an orange circle. But it's not a failure. It's not a complete success. But it's not bad.
Anyway, what was your connection for the season? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, we're unpacking that. Come on. You said you did do something. Like I think that that's why it's a yellow light. Yeah, I mean, that's still success.
Even if you were like, I plan to do this, but at the end of the day, it's like, you know, stuff happened. I would still give you to me. That's a yellow light. That you were actually doing something and then a non-avoidal situation came up that forced you to stop doing the thing.
And you were also smart enough to have the wherewithal to be like, I'm going to reschedule this to a later time when, you know, extended family isn't in town and all these other things.
Like, no, you handled that better than I would have because I would have been like, well, it's hard to kick back enjoy family and forget this ever was a thing. So no, I give you, I give you full props. A full blue heart for that one. Full blue, well, no, yes, fine. Blue hearts. You can't avoid it.
You can avoid it now, Jay. I'm on the show. I'm here just to just to promote the superiority that is blue, the color blue. You're welcome. Ah, very well. So for me, I mentioned my quest to find what what makes me, I don't want to say happy, but like what brings joy.
Like what are the things that I do? What are the things I do in my off time that I find joy in not necessarily therapy in like my Tetris habit. And I will tell you in the past two weeks, I have gone bowling. I have played a ton of video games. I have watched my my wife play baseball.
I have played or play softball. I've played softball or I've thrown like a softball around with my daughter. I have done so many things that are outside of the normal realm of what I would do in hopes that I would find something that I could say just pleasantly brought joy.
And while some things did bring joy, I don't think that there were any like specific like this brought about so much joy. I'm going to make a regular habit of this thing. So that said, I'm still giving myself the green check mark because I I found joy in doing all of these things.
But I don't think I found like any one particular thing that becomes my I would like to sit down and focus in on like doing this as a thing to bring about intentional joy. So I'm going to keep checking working on that. But also I did I did fine joy in doing many a thing. That's good.
I love bowling, honestly. It's not something I do very often, but it's it's a fun fun little thing. I'm terrible at it. Like I don't get more than about 80 points in a game. But it's an enjoyable thing. And I think honestly like I'm talking about trying to find what gives you joy.
I don't think it's like think about it. It's not going to be just one thing. It's going to be like I think the way to think about it the way that I would think about it is like what is how can I do it.
And it's not going to be the same thing every time it's going to be something it's going to be sort of a variety. But that was yeah. Finding something and it's the summer. So it's a good time for a vacation. There are many vacation.
Give yourself a day to go to the bowling alley and throw some balls at pins. And I will say that I'm a more seasoned bowler. One that I've I've done a bunch of you know, bowling leagues before for several years and I stopped. And I think that was where some of these ideas came from.
They were more of a did I lose more than I thought when I gave up on certain things. And I mean, obviously like we all gave up on a bunch of stuff from the pandemic happened like when it started. And a lot of things just you know getting back into like okay, I can do a little bit more water.
What are the things that I maybe missed that maybe I can bring back in and maybe they will replace. You know something there was a question. There was a comment in the chat that says I sound like I want a new Tetris. No, that's the things. I don't want a new Tetris.
Tetris has its place like Tetris is the thing that I play when I need my brain to be preoccupied, but I don't want it to turn off. What I'm talking about is a thing that I forget where I am. I forget what I'm doing and I am in just pure elation.
Like I have friends that do this with like yoga and stuff like that. Me not so much. I just sweat and I'm in a lot of pain when I try to do yoga. Yeah, me too. I am very in the moment in those cases. But I want something that I feel like I can disappear in, but do it in a way that's pleasant.
And when I come back, it's not coming back, dreading things. It's coming back, being excited for the experience that I've just had. And I mean, like I said, I don't know what that thing is.
I don't know if that thing is a thing, but I do know that I have identified several things, including being a mentor, working with others, collaborating with people, doing projects, creating content.
All those things bring about joy in some way, but they're not the thing that I can say when all else fails, like a guitarist will pick up the guitar, make some riffs, and forget where they were because they were.
They are now in this, they're like, sit to this new world where it's like, I'm making my music, I'm doing my thing. I'm enjoying this moment. That's what I'm looking for. And I know that it's not a guitar because I play the guitar. And like, that's just not a, that's not the thing for me.
For me, for rails, they asked and I had to pass on this question. And I think I know the answer if you were a more seasoned bowler, but do you put the barrier up or down on the, because some bowling alleys have, I used to call them bumpers, but they basically block off the gutters.
So you don't, you can't get a gutter ball. I would, I would get yelled at a lot if I played with bumpers. I'm a 200 average bowler. Yeah, that's a lot better than me. So yeah. I used to, I used to play with bumpers.
I used to find an excuse to play with bumpers because usually in bowling alleys, they only do it for small children. And so like, I would find an excuse to like go bowling with like a younger cousin so that we just keep the bumpers up the entire time. And so I couldn't do that bad.
Because otherwise I, I have a chance that I let into game with 20 points. So, because I can't pull. But anyway. But yeah, finding the thing for me, I think that thing would be, I don't know, there's a lot of different things.
But I find if I need a break, it's a good sort of mental break to, I don't know, books do that for me. To be able to escape the world for a minute. But it's different for everyone. And what you said about guitarist is true because I used to play guitar.
And I don't need more, but it is, it's very much a different world that you can escape into when you do that. And when you come back, it's not like, oh, I'm like, I'm back. It's like, no, I'm back. Like, oh, that was fun. I really enjoyed that moment. I can take that into the rest of the day.
Speaking of the rest, we have plenty of conductor connections. This is going to be a really weirdly paced show, but I'm here for it. We're doing the fine-matcher thing where we go off on tangents. And we keep going off on tangents.
And if we don't control it, this is going to be a two hour long show. Exactly. And we have a sponsor read at some point that we have to get to. So let's start with our soprano of the show, Deborah. She says that I'm a couple days late on this connection check.
I got everything set up for going back into the office. After all, that I ended up not being assigned an intern, but I still had to go in three days this week for other reasons and got a bit more out of it. Oh, Kathy, did the thing to me? That's not fair. I think this is on purpose.
Okay, cool, cool. So that was an older connection. And then a new connection was made in the last fortnight was make sure the house is ready for parents to visit in the end of June. Clean the kitchen in the bathroom and then make sure the guest doesn't have any in progress projects piled up on it.
And there's another connection check that says got everything ready and prepped for the parents visit that starts as we're recording, I guess, tomorrow. I don't know when this was posted, but awesome.
I do love the deadline of like, I've got all these things that I know I need to do and I have to do them by this time because otherwise people want to place the sleep. But whether you use that as fuel or you were just more determined than I would be. Congratulations.
Next connection, our hydration of the show. There's two here, but I'm going to go with the second one because I think that's the connection check. Our hydration of the show water Brian said they mapped out the areas of their life.
They mapped out their areas of life in their system and have a place for their someday slash maybes. The system is an efficient, but it's there. So I'm calling it a step forward.
I like that because honestly, whenever you whenever you make a system and I did this with I used to do daily, daily journaling. It's like you can stress so much about making the system perfect, but the most important part is that the system is there.
And so yeah, the system doesn't have to be perfect. It doesn't have to be efficient, but yes, having that place for your as water Brian calls them, there's someday slash maybes. That's great. Honestly. And that's a that's a whole green apple for that connection check. Awesome.
Our Tony of the show Tony says connection check green box screen square. I've made some progress moving most of my chaotic client more towards a planning mode. They still like to have random emergencies, but that's just how it is sometimes. Yeah. I totally get that.
I've been and going back to what water Brian said sky that the idea of like I have a system. No, it's not perfect, but it is a system and that's better than having no system.
I have moments like that with some of the clients that I still have Tony where like yeah, in a perfect world, you want to be able to solve for all of the variables, but unfortunately you you sometimes just can't. So the fact that you've solved for a lot of them is great in my opinion.
Yeah, yeah, next connection check are out of the show. My friend Kate says gave themselves a green book, which is good connection check been working through the list and they're happy with what they've got with I can talk.
Been working through the list and they're happy with what they've done so far. I'm trying to remember what this is in reference to, but green green connection check that's good.
Speaking of lists, I will have to check with you at some point to talk all of the things that we don't talk about on conduit with productivity apps and such because I am in a I'm in a period where the silksonic method is not as silk as I like not as silky smooth as I would like.
 Definitely have to check on that since I've shamelessly plugged a show before I'm going to say I think two episodes ago on on find my dragon we talked about was it two episodes ago the last two episodes we've talked about task management and note taking and daily routines so that that's one of the reasons why that that reminder popped into my head so.
Okay, yeah, was that I make some remember you'd mentioned it. Our tire advocate of the show, Chintas, I don't know why tire advocate of the show isn't listed there.
I think I put the name I didn't remember okay, I couldn't remember what what Chintas name was and I was like am I paranoid is this Kathy out to give me for all the times that I've messed it up.
Possibly anyway, Chintas says connection check I rearrange my working day to help take my daughter to school with her broken ankle and also we decided to postpone the vacation so that she's not hobbling around on a big boot.
 Yeah, that's that's a I mean the again it's these things that like when something comes in and derails not to you know point to our next person but you know kind of throw us out of the way you know kind of throws things off of the path and being able to have the wherewithal to stop reflect how is this going to impact me and what do I need to do and then actually go about doing it to me that is all the like that's all the greenness in that moment.
 Yeah, I said with mine or as you said with mine before learning when to postpone things I mean it was for a different reason but it's a good idea honestly like it vacation it's still vacation but it probably wouldn't be very fun for the person with the broken ankle so being able to postpone that that's honestly great also speaking of derailing things that's a good segue I'm proud of that one.
 Our rails that's why I said yeah yeah yeah okay yeah I'm stealing the show Jay it's fine so our what was what was rail these names because I wrote it down wrong the rails of the show is it the show is it training things of the show I think it's the training these years of the show if I were a better host I would have also sent you a link to the spreadsheet where we have all of these names listed I was wondering it's automatic but yeah.
 So our our train enthusiast slash rails of the show says connection check they he signed up for fitness plus instead of fit bud has shag not sponsored that's okay done some work toward the quid's I can talk done some work towards the quiz game worked on my master resume and even sent a finished I think this is copy drum I'm going to look at it in discord they worked on their master resume and even sent a finished copy to a to even sent a finished copy to two professional colleagues for their review and for a job so green connection check it's either that or their master's resume to two colleges for review and for a job because if I remember correctly yes is is Dave a speaker teacher I think so I don't know educator in some way I feel like I can know this as someone part of the community but I don't remember that's okay not a teacher just left university okay so yeah maybe maybe working on okay so sent resumes to companies and working on resumes sending to other professionals and things for review and possibly for a job okay I get I'm not a professional podcast all in all fitness resumes looking for jobs can do it in the in the context of fitness plus instead of fit bud I've tried both of them and honestly like not sponsored I have found so much success with fitness plus just because it the attitudes of the trainers it like works for me the layout of the workouts the ability to select different types of workouts and even like within strength you can select you know like everybody lower body total body this isn't a sponsorship from Apple because Apple doesn't sponsor us but I like fitness plus and it works for me so ralsey I hope you have great success with this plus because it seems to it seems to be a great tool for a lot of people and speaking of things that work for me and speaking of sponsors this episode of conduit is brought to you by set up getting things done not trademark is a challenge that everyone struggles with well maybe the trademark to listening to music is a long use productivity hack among creatives problem is there's almost too much choice how do you find the right one set up is a subscription based productivity

clean my Mac search and follow set up on Spotify to state productive that's ETA P are things to set up for their support of this show and all of relay of them all right so Sky you you kind of mentioned it before that you've you've started a new thing and I didn't talk too much about it in my quest for finding you know what brings joy but a few episodes ago I hinted at a project that I made that I started a new thing to well I rebuilt a existing thing with diversity or just not tech which is now actually a website and you can go to it today and you can use it if you're in the tech space and you want to find diversity communities that cater to your your place of being in this world so I was happy to have you guessed this week so that we could talk about some of the individual thoughts processes anxieties concerns loves hatreds all of those things around the new things that we've started and we we talked a little bit about this before the show you are doing a new show but you're approaching it differently then your other show find my dragon why why did you decide to take a different approach to it so part of what we decided when we started find my dragon was this is going to be a no stress fun project that we're just going to do it for fun there's not going to be any dependencies or anything like that in this in this in this fun thing that we're doing and so and and we've done that so it's just you know if our schedules don't work out we skip a week or we move recording back a day or if like we we share the our audio files through iCloud just because that's the easiest way to do it like we do all these things and it's like the the entire goal of this show was to just do it for fun and also the way I edit it is is very it doesn't take very much time it's just getting out the little things that like if I messed something up I'll take it out but editing doesn't take very long and that is it's a fun way to do it it means that neither of us neither me or Kim have you know we have no stress doing this the only the only thing for this show is is you know finding time and it's like we've been fine and also it's it's weird scheduling because I'm in US central time and my co host is in central European time so we've got about a seven hour difference which is fun for scheduling recordings but the whole point of my dragon was to do something fun and not too stressful and I'm not saying that the new thing I started is more stressful but it's more produced I think would be a way of saying it something I started the idea came from I I personally enjoy trivia I watch trivia shows where as I was like I don't know Europeans would call them quiz shows but things like Jeopardy other like you know prime time game shows that are on and I have always enjoyed watching and also being the being the weird person who yells at the TV when they know the answer because that's what I do and that's what you do when you're watching Jeopardy if you know the answer you have to say it out loud it's a requirement when you're watching Jeopardy I also feel like it's one of those things that now with trivia podcast being such a thing people just think that I've gone a bit mad when I'm just walking or climbing a public place and I'm just talking to myself giving answers out yeah game show the incomparable game shows one of those shows I have to be careful about listening to in public especially specific games on the game show because they are first of all they're hilarious and second of all I will want to blur out the answers so but anyway the new show I started the idea sort of the idea has been roaming around I think since the since around April or so April or May but it's it's taken a couple different forms but what I settled on sort of the process of starting something new is it's a weird process because when you do creative projects you can get stuck in a sort of loop where you have what you believe is a great idea for a project and might be a great idea for a project and you might think about it for so long and have these great ideas to like how you can expand it or what you can do with it or all that but you are you become so in love with the idea that you never actually do anything with it and that was specifically something that I was starting to avoid but like starting any sort of new creative project you know starts it starts with the idea and it also starts with honestly knowing your own boundaries and we've talked about when to say no before but knowing what you can take on what you have the time and energy to take on and also not just today but in the future if you will have time to do this or if you will need to step it back or do you know do it differently because you might have your priorities and time commitments might be different in the future and that's something I had to think about because like right now I'm in summer right I've got you know, I've got free time coming out of my nose because I'm not taking any classes right now my only dependency is my my job e job and besides that I've got I've got nothing else and so because of that it's I had the ability to take on a new project and so I had the ability to do this and also I've been doing like you know I've been coding things for fun and doing different writing blog posts just because I have the free time to do that but starting this project I you know I had to tell this to myself I have to do this now am I going to have time to do this when the semester starts again and I don't know I like and and you're allowed to not know this sort of thing but what it what I sort of told myself was I am going to find time to do it when I can but I'm not going to stress myself to do it when I need to be focusing on schoolwork right because I have my priorities and right now for me you know graduating as a priority and I'm going into my second year of university but you know taking care of my classes doing all that and I will find like if if I I'm very regimented about how I block out my time but I feel like you know I feel like if I do find time to do this then so be it and it's a fun project and there's so many different ways I can take it my like I've already got so many ideas for what I can do with the next episode I'm having a hard time deciding what I want to pursue for the second episode of this show I've got a couple outlines for different topics I could talk about but When it comes to time like this is what I wrote down the show document I got no one to hold them no one to fold them no one to walk away no one to run right I wanted to say no basically If you have an idea it could be a great idea, but you don't have time to do it and that's fine I have specifically an idea's document in my craft for for different things It's like I want to do this and it feels like a great idea, but I don't have time to do it or I don't know what the right way to do It is it's like you got to know what to hold them Right and sometimes you got to know and throw an idea away So no one to fold them I feel like I feel like I'm so south right now Yeah, but that's because I told you you were earlier, but For those that don't know that is a song I've never played poker so But no that is the gambler but Really quick one of the things that I like about this project is Whether you intentionally did it or whether you fool were like I want to do a trivia podcast How about instead of a trivia podcast we do like a information podcast instead You've created a project that can easily be picked up and put down and it could even be by design It could also be like super evergreen super pre-rolled which is Amazing so like you could go in and record a years worth of episodes if you release an episode Twice a week that's 24 episodes a year you could knock out one or two episodes Over the summer like over the course of a few days or as you get to them I know that you're a fan of the ones eGP Gray and I feel like this type of content works really well No, it isn't Kate Kate says it's 26 is every other week.
 I included holidays Yeah, if there's if there's 50 weeks in the year then because because two of them at the end are taken off because Yeah, yep, yep, I'll set it wrong one like twice a week would be two episodes per week, but But the the overall thought is like you could do as much or as little of this show as you would like and I don't think that anyone would Think oddly about it that it's like okay if you do one a month that's fine if you do one a day I mean, I wouldn't encourage that but you could it's fine if you wanted to do Every two weeks twice a week once a week Whatever it is if you want to just do it for the summer and say I'm going back to college during that time I'm going to think about all of the different topics that I want to cover and then we will return next summer You do it every summer for the next four years you could do any of those things and it work and it work With the same level of success each time I think that there's a really cool process in that and then also there's like multiple ways to think about this from marketing from outreach all of this different stuff And I don't like I said I don't know how intentional that was but I love the fact that you the thing that you said yes to was Something that was as flexible as the thing that you chose Yeah, yeah, honestly, and I don't think that that's the sort of thing that I heard me afterwards is Because I don't know it's a one person show and as you said the topics are so evergreen This isn't as it's something I realized this is an astro the first topic US presidents If I wait long enough a new president's gonna be elected and so I'll have to you know, but I digress these these topics are very evergreen and but it wasn't like I don't know it might have been a subconscious thing to purposely create a project for myself to that that was so flexible But it didn't feel like something I did on purpose It was mostly just this is just how it ended up working, but That said it's it's very nice to be able to have this sort of project but I'm gonna I'm gonna put this on you.
How do you go about?
 You know dealing with ideas and dealing with starting new projects Because I want to know your perspective on this So I like to start things I like to start things more than I like to finish them to be honest I As a professional my process is different than in my personal like life I'm at the point now personally where I Don't like being the Only person you know you mentioned You know this is a show where it is just you you were doing all the things Which I think you could even modify this to have other people even if those people are behind the scenes Helping with research and things like that I Have decided I'd never want to do that again.
 I never want to do a show where I'm the only person and that is because I Feed off of other people's like Not I don't say energy like I'm some sort of parasite but I Get my inspiration from other people being in the room and saying things like I can I can hear someone say I wonder if there's a way to do this and then my head will instantly spark an idea and take that idea like 50 different places But because of that if I'm the only one working I Can Sit in my room and work on a thing honestly talking about this project I've done that right I sat and I worked on this and worked on it worked on it and finally what I had to do was I had to put it in front of other people and ask them should I ship this now?
Is there anything that you can see that is preventing me from just releasing this today because left to my own devices?
I Will nitpick this thing and it will never see the light of day and What I've what I've come to realize about myself now is having someone else I Become that other person I become the person that's like, oh, it's good enough.
Just ship it Let's just do it like and I don't know why that is.
 I don't know if it's like If it's a failure I get to share the failure like I get to relish it versus When it's just me it's like oh no j-failed not necessarily j-s project So again, there I think there's like Some levels there that I need to unpack but also Now the things that I do and this includes professionally are always planned in coordination with other people and done in a way where Their feed like my goal is to talk myself out of it until I just can't and then from there Go in with the idea of we now have the best version of the initial version of this idea And I say that because conduit Isn't what it became conduit became something different But it only got to that point after we launched You know if we if we talked about what we wanted it to be from day one We never would have launched because we would have still been trying to figure it out We did like I think I mentioned this before I believe we did like almost three months of Demos and going back and forth and almost a total of six months of the entire planning phase Of of the show from idea to launch was about six months So in that moment After all of that planning after all that coordination what you wind up getting and what exists is different from what you had and now I think about that with like an intentional mindset.
 I'm I'm going to get this out the door so that what it will become Can get to me faster But the only way that I can do that is if I have other people Beside me because if not I get like stuck in my own head or stuck in my own foundations Yeah, I get that Um Find my dragon was not at all what we expected it to be um, I don't know I might I might have a different thing about this in my co-host, but um, I totally get that With with the um working off of other people thing um I I do find That in certain situations I can work off of other people, but um, I could not do a one person podcast if it wasn't scripted Um, and I think that's that's I think that's the truth that's true for a lot of podcasters is yeah I think that's most people I think people will try to do a pod I've definitely tried to do shows that are unscripted, but even now If I do a video Even if I don't like I will script the video well actually what I do My video process is weird.
 I outline the video I record myself doing a podcast of me free forming the video I transcribe that audio and then I use that as the baseline for the video So like I don't actually read off the script, but I use the script as my points So it's like it's freeform, but it's also scripted like only the only podcaster I know who can do an entire one person um unscripted podcast is andie and otko Because he has done one person This is off topic, but he's done one person episodes of material move his relays um podcast about google um and They're really good um, but I do not possess the ability to do one person unscripted podcast, but But that's off topic.
 I think it's also hard to do a like unless you're doing like five minute episodes I don't think Most people have the appetite to hear one person talk to themselves for An hour plus That that's really hard to do and I mean I know Alison shared and does a really good job at this, but also Alison shared and heavily scripts Her content and like she's talked about that process of scripting it out and doing all those things And that's some that's like advice that a lot of veteran podcasters will give to new podcasters of like Oh, what are you going to talk about each week?
 No, you need to have a topic If it's just you you need to have a script if it's not just you you need to have an outline so that you know When you're on topic and when you're out in the weeds and if you are out in the weeds That's fine your show can be a show where you intentionally go out into the weeds It's just You need to know once you've gotten to that point because that might be what I mean A lot of people's favorite show on this network do by Friday like I feel like that is a show that like Do by Friday is not on this know a lot of people that listen that are listening to this Or other shows on this network like another show that they like that is not on this network is do by Friday I think one of the things that makes that show as great as it is and I hope that Alex is listening right now because it just makes them squirm every time We talk about how amazing they are um But the thing about do by Friday that is such a great concept is that you come in with the intention of this is where we were going to start And at the end of the day There's a chance you never get there.
 There's a chance that you never get to that point and That has become a part of the show because but I think that that is the feeling that a lot of creators Desire of that oh, I want to be able to do a show that can go off the rails and When you were like whoa, we went totally off the rails people are like I love it when your show does that You've got you've got different styles for different shows where Find my dragon the entire point is that we go off the rails, but yes And speaking of going off the rails you create new rails like I mean Literally when you go off I mean you're from the south when you go off-roading You quickly find a path And and there's a whole level of architecture in like City planning that is built on that of like we don't lay down any roads until you see the wear and in like the pathways that people Create in their own way Instead of having to like oh, I'm gonna build this thing the the exact way that I want it to And then watch as people get you to just do whatever they're going to do already Yep, I have to clarify Um because I feel like I'm going to get um I'm going to get my visa revoked if I if I don't clarify this.
I'm not from the south I am from the Midwest. I'm from Missouri. I'm gonna go from the south. Missouri is the south. I'm sorry No, if you find yourself if you find yourself in the city If you're in Kansas City, I will give you the Midwest only because Kansas is the Midwest. Missouri is the south.
Okay, but Okay, this is completely off topic, but I I grew up in a city that is big enough to be classified. It doesn't have the feeling of the south Despite being geographically in the south.
So that's why like I cannot define myself as southern I define myself The south is Florida and that's only most of Florida the panhandle is still the south Yeah, yeah, that's fair.
The farther south and for they get What's the saying the farther south you get the more north you are in Florida?
Um, but yeah, but anyway, no um, I currently have an unofficial visa for the south because I'm going to university there in Alabama But but yes clarification um, but no um Where were we?
um I lost my trace since we don't since we don't remember where we are I will uh uh Well actually sorry, we do know where we are.
It's the south. I'm just in the southwest um but you mentioned You mentioned this idea of The show of knowing when to to full like knowing when to fold things um no in the walkaway no under on Okay, well, okay instead so I won't talk about the photo.
I'll talk about the walking away Yeah um Didn't didn't didn't didn't mean to derail you there. I'll also we keep giving external shout outs to railsy Um, thanks railsy um We're glad railsy's in live chat. That's this is the show about railsy off the rails um The rails was off the rails with railsy.
 Oh, no, no, I yeah, I'm gonna get railsy to start a podcast I think they've already had this idea, but it's just gonna be called off the rails But yes anyway, we're not fucking other people's podcasts, but to 80 HD people talking on a podcast We're not getting anywhere Yeah, yeah, honestly But anyway, no one to walk away no one to run we're on theme today, but um It's not a fun thing to talk about but you always have to Sort of It's different for different projects um because some things like you might have A bunch of people who listen or consume your content.
We're not just talking about podcasts here, but um You might have a bunch of fans you might like Sometimes you can't control when you need to kill a project And I don't know.
 I don't even know if kill is the right word for this because it seems to Powerful of a word to use but I don't know it feels like it and I think you've had more experience with You've had more experience with this than me Jay, but um Learning win to um I there are many different stages where you could kill a project I said I think is a good phrase.
 Yeah Because you have you have the idea stage and I've had so many ideas that felt so great and Wrote it down to the idea document and never got past that and And then You've also got like once you start working on it the more work you do on a project the harder it is to say goodbye um and so Even before the first Let's say product the first episode of the podcast comes out um Then like you still you still don't work on it and it still hurts to To sunset it and say you're not going to do this and then You've got you know shows or YouTube series or whatever projects that have been going on for years have hundreds of episodes and you still have to It's still time to say goodbye um you still have to learn to Learn that this is over we we've ended this um and we're we're Sunsetting this and we're you know Learning when to do that.
I don't think is I don't think comes easily to anyone um so What are your thoughts on this?
 I want to give a shout out to um Someone that I interviewed and actually one of the last interviews That I did on my show prior to conduit on Guys name is Scott Johnson and he does he has a podcast network called frog pants And he's been doing a couple of shows One is called the morning stream that he's been doing While there are thousands of episodes in it's been working on it for I think for almost 15 years um then you have Another show that he did That was legitimately one of the first world of warcraft podcasts ever and it ran I think it also ran for about 15 16 years literally one of the co-hosts was Like a teenager when the show started and is in their 30s now as As like one of the final co-hosts and It was like he had some of the best Ways to talk about how that show had evolved and how The show had effectively been over for years and instead what they did was they kept pivoting they kept pivoting they kept pivoting and A lot of people for some reason this keeps coming up in my My space and if you're a trivia nerd you might have heard about this the ship of theses Eventually you and for those that don't know the ship of theses is this this idea of A person named theses had this ship called the ship of theses And over time things start breaking and you know that person replaces them with new parts Eventually you get to the part where there's none of the original pieces from the original ship The question is is that ship the same ship of theses or has Or have they built an entirely new thing and What I have come to at least just in my Several years near a decade of making content is I would rather not Put the ship out in the water Then to watch it age in some cases Some cases you want to watch the ship age.
I love classic cars.
 I love car I mean other than the fact that they're absolutely terrible for the environment um I love a car that has Live been lived in a car that has experienced it has memories We bought we had to buy a brand new car last year like brand brand new Because of the pandemic and things and like Oh, not even a month in uh shout out to my lovely wife Who moved to the curb a little too much and scuffed the bottom of it and You know in that moment she's like panicking.
I'm so sorry. I don't know.
 I'm like it's fine battlescars and that is To me that's what life is life is a bunch of experiences And the the memories that come with those experiences and the battlescars that happen are the resemblances of that If I can't have a show that has its battlescars physically presented to the point where I'm willing to Cover them up replace them do a thing.
 I would just rather not have that thing if my youtube channel has to be this super Prim and pristine instance of me never making a mistake Me never talking about a product that later on gets shut down me having to go back on my You know endorsements of a product because they've changed their policies and things like that and these are all things that have happened to me If I can't have those Then I would just rather not do the thing and and that is that is why like I've had projects since conduit started that I have tried to launch That just Never get launched because of the conversation of what happens when this thing comes up and that's not to say that I keep things from Ever coming up It's just I understand what's going to look better with those battlescars and the things that Can weather the damage that I that I'm ultimately going to put on it Those are the things that I want to hold on to and the things that are like Um, if this gets messed up rough if someone says something dumb like I would just rather walk away from it I would just rather be like no, I don't before It ever sees the light of day because it's it's so much like you said so much easier to do it when there's no time invested or there's little time invested or there's little Imagine doing a show where you're actually making money off of that show like doing a show where you've made hundreds of dollars a month off of and then being like I don't want to do this show anymore Oh, like imagine how that feels when that's like helping to pay your bills and things like that There's so much anxiety that comes with that and that's why like I said it's got Johnson That's why people tended to do shows longer than their existence Is that they're like well?
This is part of my livelihoods.
I have to do it and There's nothing wrong with that.
 It's just if I'm going to do that I'm gonna do that for my job and not for my own personal life Flaggy flak Shout out to flaggy flak It came up in the live jet but but yes Shrhip of the UCS is an amazing thought experiment And it's a great way of putting it because Yeah, you're gonna have If you are so I think a different way of saying it is if you're so devoted to the idea of What you want it to be in the beginning?
 You're not going to let it grow into what it into what it is um And so if you like So yeah, if you have a project where you're so devoted to what you want it to be um It's not going to be able to withstand the damage after After it's in the water for a few months And after it has after it has gone through you know The the first stages of what you wanted it of what you wanted it to be and And so you're not going to be able to evolve past that and but also Things have a lifespan and you got to you have to know even if something did Kind of have that constant evolution that has lasted for a long time things have a lifespan And at some point it's just over Um and killing you're not using that word um learning wind and things is just Part of making projects, I guess death is a part of life um Even though that's actually something I disagree with if you ever watch CGP great Um death is not a part of life, but That's that's a different story um, but yeah Last bit before we we jump into connections um my my question for you is Is your Is your Fear or caution Around doing new things Does that prevent you from Thinking about them in more detail as a thought exercise Because I know that I've I've reached out to you before and been like Hey When you have time We should totally make content we should totally figure out a way to to get together and and do Even if not something regular but just something um and and I'm not I'm not calling you out on this at all But the the idea of like I understand your life is busy.
 I understand that my life is busy But I like to still think about the What is this project and what does this project need For it to be successful and can I provide that And I don't think that you can You can do that with a disqualifying mindset of like At the first sign of I cannot do this I no longer think about it because I think what has to happen there is you have to have The requirements in place you have to be able to say This is what it would take for me to do this.
 I now know all of the Parameters that would make this a successful Idea or a successful process And I'm okay if we never get to that point But also I have now identified what it looks like to be at that point and if we are at this point then I'm on board yeah so So part of what the fear is whenever you start something is You're gonna or commit yourself right and this is why you sort of You have This sort of running I don't know running joke between people that I'm not gonna let you start something new because I know you're gonna burn yourself out And that's the right Yep, yep, that's the sort of um There's a sort of things that like friends don't let friends burn out um And it might be better to say friends don't let friends start things They themselves out yeah, yeah, yeah, friends don't let friends start things that they know they don't have time for um And so Yeah whenever whenever starting something new it's like um, you know Know the time commitment you need and all those sort of things but also know just what your energy level is and what What you can do And what you want to do and if you really want to do something um Where there's a will there's a way So if you have a passion for a project or if you have a really good idea that you want to pursue Then go for it um There's the other side of this that we haven't mentioned It's like there should not be any shame in starting a new project Right if you start something like if you have an idea The best thing you can do the best time is now and the best tools are the tools that you have um No matter what you can you can always expand later, but there's no better time than now to start And that I believe that's that's almost universally true Um for for anything is if you have an idea to go for it There's no better time to start than right now um But if you're talking in the long term know your energy levels and know what you can do And just know the limit to any project um so when it's starting new thing one of like one of these days um you you talk about being a teenager in the um or The person you said who was a teenager when the show started um I think I am almost definitely the youngest person to be a guest on a really show um Because I'm 19 um I think I'm not sure you do the homework on that um I know it says rose is extremely young so I don't think that'll think she's that young though Yeah, uh, yeah, Rosemary is not as young as me um I need the I need the official history to tell me whether or not that was true um but So So and I'm a testament to honestly the fact that there's no better time than now don't let age preclude to you from starting something um and that's yeah So When it comes to starting anything one of these days I will have more time and we will make we will make something together honestly um but yeah So and and also one of the things that I want to throw in there on top of of what you've said of like Sometimes the best time to start a thing is now um I think that there's also a validation and building the thing to build the thing Uh just build it with the off-ramps in place like you said you your pro i think as I mentioned before your project earlier Was is very much a show that allows you to say I'm not going to do this show Except for when I'm not at uni right now and Those are good off-ramps and each of those off-ramps you're like hey if I decide that I just never want to come back and do this show That's that's fine too like that that is a valid Thing uh one of the things that I've started doing now is when I have A quote-unquote million dollar idea which none of my ideas are worth a million dollars But they're good ideas nonetheless But when I have like a yeah when I have a good idea Uh a good example of this was I wanted to create a college search engine So basically college board that wasn't run by advertising or business and that Surface materials like surface actual good information like graduation rates student loan debt outcomes and things like that The great idea a whole lot of time to keep up and maintain a lot of requirements on federal bodies for their data and that data might be inconsistent at best But what I can do is Create a GitHub repo where I have a list of all of the HBCUs and PBIs In the United States and have their information as of 2021 I can do that and that takes me a Week Most honestly, I think I got the basis of it down in a day Like there was nothing that prevented me from making the thing because I wanted to see the thing made in the world But I just had to change The way that I classified it.
It was no longer this oh, I'm gonna take college board down because big colleges The scam and blah blah blah blah blah blah like all that's like no no no it's If my goal is to help people by surfacing information that it will best help them Let me just Do that.
 Let me just make the thing and be happy with what I've made be okay with what I've made And when I want to make the next thing do that as well if you want to make a podcast of you know Something some random thing the first time I ever had a conversation on a podcast with Kathy We talked about You know, why is there no yodeling podcasts for like yodlers in LA because then you could literally call the show yodela But like if someone wanted to just get a bunch of people together and say hey who yodels in LA Let's let's get together and like grab coffee That accomplishes the exact same goal But the project requires a little less commitment.
 Hey, we'd grab coffee one time Maybe we decide we want to grab coffee a lot maybe in that conversation we decided might be beneficial to go to the local Later hose and shop and grab things What whatever you choose to do Sorry, sorry, but whatever you choose to do Like you don't have to do it in the way that you initially thought but you can still make that thing exist Or make something close enough to it exists in the world that you are accomplishing what you set out to do Yeah Yeah, there's a good way of putting it Speaking of things that we have to do um, I think we have connections So I think you're out.
I think I need to rapidly come up with an connection All right, well since since you were thinking about it. I will go first um I mentioned before that I launched my Web app diversity orgs.tech.
Well by the time that you're hearing this It will be officially launched Now it's soft launch you can go to a diversity orgs.
tech If you're in tech and you want to search for again organizations that catered underrepresented people people and whether you Identify as those people or you want to broaden your horizons and learn from from other folks that have different Experiences in life That's that's the plan all that said My Boss allowed me to take a lot of company time to work on this So that I could then document the experience of building An application using the the tools that we have available to us as well as some of the things that I've learned in that process So my connection is to At least start content around that process or some of the things that I learned in that in those processes and I'm going to say I'm going to say to start it but I'm going to define that a little bit better I'm going to say to have a draft available and sent to editors so that it can be an actual post So if I had to quantify this in words now.
We got a type create posts about the process of building diversity orgs.tech Okay All right, hopefully I gave you enough time.
What's yours?
So I mentioned this is the top of the show, but there's a lot of Sort of hate in the world right now um and You know, sometimes it feels like there's not a lot you can do about it um And I apologize for any background noise, but I'm in a I'm in a loudhouse, but anyway um Thank you, Javier.
 I appreciate not having to edit this show um So There's a lot of hate going around in the world right now and it feels like a lot of times there's nothing you can do about it um so As as small as as small of a gesture as it might seem I think there's a lot of power in just being kind and compassionate where you can um And sort of Knowing your boundaries and knowing when to not interact with people because It's it's worth just not interacting with people who all they do is propagate hate right um But there's a lot of I think we overshadow the fact that there's a lot of good people in the world There's a lot of really great people in the world honestly and I've found like this is not a plug for membership But I've found some of the nicest and most compassionate people in the relay members discord honestly, so um my connection For the next fortnight is to find new ways to show compassion um and to show kindness to just be Nice and kind and compassionate in situations where most of the time you otherwise wouldn't Because I believe those sort of gestures as as shallow as they might seem I think they can be powerful just spreading kindness where you can so That's That's my response to all the turmoil in the world and also To all the listeners if if you're having a hard week Know that there are people with you know that you know This too shall pass and there are a lot of nice people in the world and you know it's going to get better I believe that so So that's my connection for this week.
 I went a little um I went very emotional, but I hope that's okay um So yes, that's my connection I think that's perfectly fine and We've got some Conductor connections here our first one is from the soup of the show Kathy Campbell who says next connection surviving the decisions that have to come That will be very emotional and draining um again I don't want to Air out Kathy's business But if you can send her some unicorn emojis send her some hearts um And we'll move on to the soprano of the show So our soprano of the show said new connection Work on details such as rigging tables and chairs and ordering catering For the choir party that she finally scheduled Um, I I'm going to ask for an invitation because I like food Uh, not really, but if you're getting catering like if you want a dragon to arrive to a place I'd just like give them food that's that's the secret but good new connection Feeding my dragon at foodias they call it Our pathologist of the show Laura says new connection for this time around keep it simple Yes, I have my calendar and my giant to-do list backlog But only write down three to-do items at a time every day if possible I can grab more when I finish those I might need some adjusting as I go along But I need to feel less overwhelmed A few weeks ago someone suggested mattress to represent sleep Uh, in my I need these for brain function daily goals I love it and I've been using it ever since the 4M's meds meditation movement mattress Ah, love it Love it.
That's awesome The hydration of the show water Brian says new connection Uh Take my needs graciously.
 That's that's an interesting uh Was that an adjective Or adverb I'm not sure yet graciously takes adverb Um most days I am harsh and punitive on myself about needing things that's not right nor is it sustainable Yes a thousand percent um one you can do it and even if for some reason you can't do it Um, you can give yourself the grace that's necessary Just remember if you're about to give yourself a red X think to yourself Would cather your j give me a red X in this case and the answer is of course no So Our Tony of the show is that is that his of the show name I thought it was Is it Tony of the show?
