From really FM, you're listening to Conduit, the show where we condue our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that like short goals and long planning. This episode is brought to you by Member Fall. I'm Kathy and with me is a very incorrect human named Jay.
They're all tamales. You cannot convince me otherwise. No. It's fine, you're wrong, whatever. The reason that this introduction exists because of the live show, which we record every two weeks in the relay FM switch on discord. And we had a very in-depth conversation where Jay is incorrect.
Don't tell them. Just if they want to know, if they want to know why everything is a tamale, then they can go to I'm a superconductor.com and become a superconductor. And then they can tell us where their allegiance lie. Are you team tamale? Are you team losing? Wow. This is my show. And it's fine.
But some of the other things you can get when you become a member is some of these incredible conversations other than in the live show where we argue about things. But in the discord, the scrub daddy content is strong.
Someone discovered that they did, in fact, have a scrub daddy, but it's been used so much that it looks like a lupha, which is entertaining. And then someone also brought up the fact that on Reddit, there was someone that got an order of three scrub daddies. And one of them only has one eyeball.
So it's a scrub d'arty. So I thought that was really entertaining. You can be a part of all of these inside jokes by joining the membership and become a member in the discord.
And if you are already a member, you can go to your memberful account and follow the links instructions to join the discord.
And if you support us directly, us conduit, the team that is team conduit, team conduit, you then get to hang out in our co-working session where we talked about the ever evolving situation that is social media.
And if that doesn't entice you like I know it does, we also learned how Kathy has effectively pulled the, or lifted the, we have to be well behaved in our co-working space. So all the bleeping, yeah, we get real, real gritty, real hot.
And we have a hard core in the co-working space when we talk about all the stuff, no filters, no, nothing held back. So yeah, if you want to enjoy that experience of watching Kathy say all the bad words. And yeah, I'm a superconductor.com. That's a letter I, letter M, letter A, superconductor.com.
All right, let's get some shout outs. Jay, do you have a shout out? I do. Shout out to our amazing editor, Javier, who is actually going on vacation. So we're just going to warn you now that the next episode of conduit has already been recorded.
We had to record it last week so that our editor could enjoy their vacation where I'm not going to tell you where they're going. But it's going to be really fun. And I'm jealous. And I wish I was there with them.
But we wanted to make sure that we respect good work, life balance, and healthy boundaries, and all these other productivity buzzwords that usually don't mean anything. We want them to mean something here. So we have already recorded that episode.
That episode is being edited, maybe not as we speak, but it is being taken care of already. So there will be a little episode out of time that will not be like any of the other shows that we do normally, but fret not.
But also kind of like the shows that we do, because it is spoiler, I guess, it's a systems check, which you, if you listen to the show or if you want to go back to our history, you'll discover the fact that we've done systems checks before. Yes.
And because of that, we're actually giving people some extra time for their connections this weekend. We'll talk a little bit more about that later.
So if you haven't already gotten your connection in, check out the episode and then think about it and then give us your connection and make it especially long because we will not cover it for at least a month. So yes. There's that. Hence, hence the jokes at the beginning, long planning.
Anyways, another shout out to our very special Carrie, who is our chief advertising officer here at Relay FM switch on, who has gotten us so many great sponsors for the upcoming episodes. I am very excited for the one that has a shipment arriving.
They've tailored it to my food requirements and I cannot wait for it to arrive. So that's some exciting. I'm in the minimum. Sorry, somebody here is allergic to onions. I can't help things. It's fine. But anyways, how about we do our connection check? That said the tamale.
All right, Sam, which, how did you do on your connection? Yeah, about that. So my connection was to create a T minus whatever for the next event that was happening in June. And I know I was supposed to do it. And I was like, well, I at least need a countdown timer.
So at first it was going to be a red like did not do. And then I was like, you know what? I can at least do that. I can at least give myself a countdown timer. So I know how long I have until the thing happening. And that'll give me the energy and mental awareness to do the things.
And to my surprise, I had already created one, which was great. So I gave myself an extra bonus point there for having already done the thing that I was going to do, which was the bare minimum for the thing that I needed to do. But also I have not done anything beyond that.
So therefore I'm giving myself an orange circle. Kathy, what about, oh, I guess one more thing folks like to know what apps we use from time to time. We normally don't tell them. I'll tell them this time only because it's kind of new and I'm playing around with it. It's called up ahead.
And I think there's been some blog posts about it on like Mac stories and all that stuff. So go check that out if you want. But yeah, that was me. Kathy, how'd you do? Well, not great. So my connection was to solidify a plan for planning when coming back from a trip.
And this particular trip coming back was a lot. Chaos was deep, deep in our life. And that's okay. I'm acknowledging it. I'm letting it go. And I am giving myself a red like X because I did not even begin it.
That's okay because again, we survived, including mini soup being really sick after getting for teeth extracted. And so it was just kind of a hot mess as they say. So you know what, that's okay. We'll see what this next time brings.
And yes, Ramon, there's still time if you want to add a connection. We can toss that in because you'll be giving a connection for the next round, which means you don't have a connection check. So we have plenty of time. So you can throw that in now if you would like.
Just make sure to give us your of the show name. And don't pick tamale. All right.
Jay, what about our conductors? How did their connections go? Well, our sloth of the show, Ankenu, said that they wrapped up the last three characters for the first commission set and put a couple of hours into the second no longer working from home.
So the commute has left them with little time and energy, but they are working to carve things out. Nice. Our fish bear of the show, Fishekai has a green book. Well, technically it's a total success because I made a household task list and thought about priorities like I wanted.
Didn't go exactly as planned, though. You are more aware than I am how complex this type of project can be. I very quickly decided the best way to chase success was by lowering the bar. I now have tasks in two piles have to do and everything else. And that's good enough for now. Heck, yeah, it is.
Oh my gosh, I'm so proud of you. It's okay to lower the bar. It's okay to not have those expectations and to make those adjustments in a way that lets you be successful. So I am super proud of you. Well done.
And our eight no mountain high dwelling of the show, Luging said green tree tile laid and grounded wood floors put in it's starting to look really healthy. I'm glad that it looks nice and cozy, awesome and how is he. And I guess if you run any problems call around to rousey. I don't know.
I love it. Well done. Well, frickin' done. All right, our shark of the show Chris says connection check green check mark. I was able to get my home office ready for the arrival of the in laws. They arrived the day that this episode records and someone didn't delete the end of that, but that's fine.
Well done Chris. I am so glad that you're in laws. Hopefully have made it. Okay. And are getting nice and cozy in the clean home office. Our panda of the show James says surprising everybody involved. I have actually relaxed reasonably well for the last couple of weeks. Yay.
And I've made steps towards being more social. Boo. Oh, I mean, I don't know. I don't know if we're I guess. Yay. Well, which is equally good for my brain. Okay. Fair enough. Yay. We'll go back. All right. Uh. Duh. Duh. Duh.
Our identical twin of the show Aaron says connection check green check mark made appointment for some blood work this week, hoping the results will be on the up and up. I hope that they are as well. Let us know either way if you would like. Uh, I hope everything's great. Our oracle of the show.
Sof has a green apple. I did the meditating thing and I submitted the journal article I've been working on for about two months, little bits of work, making big progress. Ooh, that sounds awesome and very close to what we're talking about today. I love it. Do do do. All right.
Our train enthusiast of the show Rails says connection check yellow heart. I haven't quite done as I hope. It's time to use this month to do something a bit larger. Spoiler alert. Somebody was at the live recording for our last episode. That will be the next episode.
Our blue dragon of the show Skylar says blue heart. The semester is done. Once again, survived. Congratulations on yet another survival. Again, if you need help, I heard Ronda Rousey's about. All right.
Our last connection check from our conductors is from Robert, the nameless of the show, connection check green circle. I got my listing ready and it has been uploaded for sale. I also have been listening to more music and have been really enjoying going through my Spotify artist top five.
I love that you kind of have the split into and you did both of them and also one of them is for fun and one of them is for not fun. So I mean, listing is also never mind. Anyways, this episode of Condoit is brought to you by our good friends at Memberful.

And with every ad read, I like to pick a random language to say thank you and this one. Oh, you did this to yourself. I did this one to myself. I picked Marathi and I'm going to do my best on this. I'm going to say, Don Yavada. Okay, yeah, we're going to go with that.
If I was even close, let me know. And if I wasn't and you speak Marathi, then be sure to send us an audio recording of how to say that properly. And I apologize for any mistakes that I made in trying to say that. All right. So we are going to be talking about long term planning today.
And that's mainly because there will be a full month to work on your next connection instead of just the two weeks. And so we kind of wanted to discuss how planning for a long term thing works differently than a short term or even two weeks and how your mindset can kind of adjust.
I know I have a hard, harder time sitting and like going, Okay. If I don't have to do this now, I will procrastinate and put it off for a bit, which is not great. I know that this is not the healthiest way to do things. And yet it's how my brain works.
And so I am constantly working towards trying to be better at all of these things. And what do you think? How does your brain work over there? Well, first we have to check to see if it works. Well, yes, that's true.
When I start trying to do long term stuff, I like that is like the biggest struggle for me is. I believe how my old boss used to say it's a marathon and not a sprint. I was like, I was born to be a sprinter.
Like I have asthma, like the longer I have to do a thing, the more tired I get and then you start running into issues. And honestly, I tend to work better with very well-defined constraints, deadlines and then being approaching.
A good example of this is I was working on a project with a colleague and the colleague was like, Hey, I can only work on this for 45 minutes. And I was like, Oh, great. That's awesome. Let me start a timer. And they were like, Oh, like the excitement level is high.
And I was like, yes, because I know if I only have 45 minutes to do this, it's going to get done. Like we're going to get done. And honestly, the less time that we have, the more the better quality the thing will be because I won't have time to sit there and overthink, overcorrect, over adjust.
Yes. And what I've tried to do in kind of this longer form planning is to, I don't want to say chunk it down, but like basically segment it into small deliverables with extreme. Like, I'm going to do a lot of extremely tight deadlines. Yes.
So that I can, I can still work in that very small like, I've got to get this done in this time, which also might be the deadline.
Like, I guess a good example for that is I'm giving a, I was asked to give a talk, but I have to give the details of the talk and I have like three more days left to submit that talk.
The event itself isn't happening until October, but obviously I waited until the last minute for the deadline to submit the talk. And that worked because I had all the things I needed already. I just needed to remove the concept of time, which gave me the ability to overthink it, which is awesome.
Yeah, that is also definitely how I work. A lot of times I have a client who he thinks very big picture and I will take that those big picture moments. And kind of drill down and be like, okay, so these are the steps that I need to get this going. I need to get this and get started.
But I do not want to think about the future things until I'm done with the current things. And that is really difficult for me to be able to kind of wrap my brain around what happens in the future too far, especially if there's steps that have to be finished beforehand, which is very interesting.
And difficult, but you know, it's important to know how your brain works and it's important to be able to make the adjustments that you need in order to like be productive, I guess. I think in some ways it is that idea of, you know, a lot of people can't see the forest from the trees.
And I think that it's good to have someone who is very good at looking at the forest. But also, I don't know how many people have seen this like the world's largest organism. And it's literally like this fungus thing that looks like an entire forest.
That my brain works in giant fungus thing like all the forest, the forest is the tree. It's just one. And I have to take care of it from a health standpoint because if the tree goes, the whole forest is gone. And I think that that's again, that works in some ways and that works in some mindsets.
But I think there is also a benefit of being a part of a team that is. You have some people who are tree watchers or tree gazers, you have some people who are bird watchers. And then you have some people who are like up in the helicopter or up in the guard post looking at the entire forest. Yes.
I think that's like the best thing to do and to put you know where you are in that space and put yourself around people who are going to help. With that. And I think that was that was another conversation that came up in our coworking session, Kathy. Yeah.
And in that I actually know it didn't because it came up in the episode that will be out next. It's hard. Time. Yeah, out of time, episode of time. It's difficult. Yeah. But as we, as you will learn about next week, my systems check this, this time around was a little daunting.
And challenging because I am struggling to find a system that works well at observing the forest because I'm so used to. Being in the tree like I'm so used to that drilled in focus and now I need a tool that's going to give me a better overall view. I won't go into too much detail about that here.
Save that one for two weeks from now. Yeah, I tend to collect people around me that have a higher level view because it is so difficult for me to work my brain on that. I have to work very difficult to try and have larger steps.
And I know that's a failure, not a failure, but I know that's a difficulty in me. But I, I'm aware of it, which means I can try and work harder. But again, it's really difficult for me. It's so hard.
Have you been able to convey that to those people?
Like I know that you have an entire blessing that you're responsible of and for is, is that something that you openly speak to when you're like, if you're like providing mentorship or guidance, you're like, hey, I'm going to be able to give you a lot of this mindset from, from this person.
From this perspective, because this is where I'm, I'm great. You may also want to talk to someone who has better knowledge and maybe this long form planning area. Kind of, but not really mainly because most of the things that I do when I am like mentoring is working with the person.
And how their brain works, which is really just asking the questions and paying attention to the answers and what they're not saying with words, which means I don't have to do, I'm not doing the long term planning for them. I'm giving them the guidance to do it themselves if that makes sense. Yeah.
So I don't have to have someone that my brain doesn't have to work with a long term planning to know how it can work for somebody that is able to do it if that makes sense. Yeah, I remember it. I don't remember. I think it was our last systems check.
I had mentioned mind mapping and you were like, yeah, no, my brain, my brain don't do that. Nope. How do you, because again, we've talked a lot about, you know, hey, planning for the long term, find someone that's good at it.
What if that person doesn't exist? What have you, I mean, it never minutes your show you. No, no, hey, just because I'm the one that's like introducing doesn't mean that it's just my show that's the whole point of being co-hosts, sitting and having these conversations together.
Including questions like, yeah, yeah, what, what was your question? How, when there isn't someone there, how do you, how do you kind of fit the square peg of long planning into the round hole that is my brain best works in short form? By making it up as I go along, I like that.
That's that's very, very blunt honestly. Yeah, I'm very agile and I work better, solving immediate problems. I'm very reactive in the way that it works. And for most of the things, apparently it's working just fine. And I guess that's okay until I find something that makes a big concern.
I'm going to, I'm going to do it. And yeah, Rails E has a suggestion and this is very much kind of where I'm at. So breaking a big thing into smaller chunks and just focus on that one chunk in a short period of defined time.
With the exception that I'm not breaking the bigger project down, I am doing that step that I know needs to happen first. And then when that project is done, I'm figuring out what the next project is.
So it's a very soft form of the larger end goal, but is it works with my brain? I enjoy the make it up as I go along because that to me that is I, I still feel as if the enemy of long planning is often the idea that every single one of you can do.
And I think that's the idea that every step needs to be understood all the time. Especially because you do not know what is going to happen when you start doing the first things. Well, it's like, it's that whole thing about boxing. Like everyone has a plan until you get punched in the face.
I believe Mike Tyson said that. You can have an idea of what you, you want to happen. And I feel as if holding on to that idea so tightly that you're unable to, I think you use the word be agile to be, to be adjustable to be able to think about it. I think that's almost like, almost like that.
Hear me out, Kathy. What, what I think there's this game where you have a bunch of pieces. And the pieces fall down into certain, and you put them in certain places. I think it's called Tetris or something like that. No, that can't be it.
Like again, the beauty of it is that you only know what the next piece is. You don't know. And I guess in some games, you might know a couple of pieces down the road. And even in other games, there's an algorithm that like you can, you can kind of identify what's coming.
Anyway, in the, in the best form of the game. Like you only know the next piece. That's it. And what you have, and you know, the very next piece coming up.
And you have to position your board in a way that it's flexible to be able to handle pieces in any pattern that may appear or in the best pattern that appear.
And this is how some of the best players of that game have been able to just continuously break barriers of like, oh, well, the game was designed only work to this score. Well, they broke that. Oh, well, we thought that no one would ever be able to play past this level. They broke that.
And the way that they did it was they started coming up with a standard way of stacking pieces so that you could deal with droughts happening where you don't get the piece that you need for 40 or 50 pieces. And you're still able to be flexible enough to deal with that.
And I think that that's where when you're talking about long planning, like that's to me the biggest like help like we had our big event that we just got back from or that I just got back from.
We almost like we had to literally run to the dollar store and get like dollar store lights to help decorate our booth because we didn't know what the setup was going to be until we got there. Right.
So no matter how much we were like, well, let's have let's make sure we have this many microphones or let's make sure we have this amount of chairs or open spaces and this amount of lighting. We had none of that we literally got there and we were like, okay, we're here.
We can start planning around that versus being like, well, let's create five different alternative scenarios of what's going to happen. Right. Yeah, you can't you can do planning up to a point. It's important to like be aware of the limitations of planning that you can do.
And make sure that it does not hinder your goals too because you want to make sure that you are doing the planning required to be prepped without over planning to waste your time and also like cause significant issues if stuff doesn't work.
I guess the only other piece of that maybe is the like, I don't know if it's like, know the plan, know when the plan is off the rails and then understand how to get back on to the rails maybe. Oh my gosh, I am laughing because I this TikTok came up on my like reminder, like my history.
And now I need to log in and find it because it's one of my favorite ones that I've that I ever did and hold on. Let me see if I could find it. Well, Kathy is looking for that I will expound on that on that idea or that thought there.
We've talked about like, oh, when you plan, you know, don't plan too far ahead. Don't don't immediately like panic when things don't go the way that you want.
There's my experience in the military was was kind of great in this in that you have like this, this like what happens when things don't work and kind of unexpected thing. And I think that's where like the documentation kind of comes into play.
Again, this is this is where seeing the tree and not the forest in many ways is super helpful. In the bullet journal method there, like I get the book the bullet journal method. There is this story about someone who documented like they do bullet journaling and all this other stuff.
And then their kid gets sick and because they bullet journaled everything they had this like these detailed notes of everything that was happening with their child that they could just hand to the doctor.
And I know they like most of us have smart watches that collect health data and do all that other stuff and now they have that information.
But that was actually something that I took from that's like the most important thing that I took from that book was that like I started creating these small logs for anytime my child got sick.
It would be like okay, this time here's the event that happened and it was funny because I took that from a different experience that I had while I was in the military where we were quote unquote on duty where literally we had to document.
We had to like walk around whatever we were on watch for every interval of time sometimes it was like an hour sometimes 30 minutes or whatever.
And then we would have to document anything that we saw during that time that was out of the ordinary oh sprinkler was on or something and it wasn't supposed to be on or.
Oh, hey, had to stop this fight from happening here and is at this time at this date and these were the people involved or hey, I just walked around and nothing happened.
I walked around and everything was good and I think that everyone hates doing that and everyone's like why am I doing that until you need to go back and go through that log and be like okay, the last time this happened.
I saw this thing happen at this time things were good for three hours and then things went off the rails. So that gives me three hours to figure out what I need to do and how I need to prepare for how they went off the rails and also here's what we did to remediate the problem.
So being able to just document and again being able to sometimes study the tree will give you the ability to understand what's happening in the forest in a better way so that when something happens you're able to get back to it. Kathy, it looks like you found your video.
I did and so if I think made the quote so it's make the plan execute the plan, expect the plan to go off the rails, throw away the plan. Yes. Oh, yeah, I'm glad I I spent that time looking for this very important to talk to contribute to the conversation. Oh goodness.
So yeah, I think it's also important to think of the long term plans and what foundational moments you can like help support the long term plan, whether it's you know the basics like hydration and eating and blah blah blah blah blah.
But also like the little things that can make you be able to actually succeed with those plans. So just the the the pieces involved and making sure you have access to the tools that you need before you need them. And so planning to get the things in place is important too.
Oh, Ron has a very good point in the chat. Aren't plans just strong ideas that can change. I like that actually. A lot. I I do wonder how.
And I feel like this is a question I need to ask my wife because there is there's like this level of determination that I think also comes into factor in terms of plans. Great example of this recently I have come to want a 3D printer.
And in my mind, I'm like, I need to come up with a plan to get this 3D printer. And the first the first stage of that plan was, what are all of the things that I could make with a 3D printer. And then it was like, well, here's all the things I could make that would benefit me.
Now what are the things that would benefit the rest of the people in the family so that a 3D printer is more likely to look like a good idea and to really have them excited to have one in the house or not in the house or like in the garage or whatever.
And also I am the person who needs to also do the research on what 3D printer.
How much does it cost? Can I get it used? Should I get it used? What does construction look like? How much space does it take up? Does it have a smell?
And like all of these little things and I need to be prepared for all of these as they're happening because that's that's where like I think that there is like planning and then there's like implementation of said plan.
Yes. And I also think that there's like that, you know, we've talked about like have a plan plan doesn't work goes off the rails. You got even I think that that is a different portion of quote unquote planning.
Then the let's let's me some plus this let's grab all the things that we need to know and maybe that's like a step in there is like grab the things that you need to know grab the things that you might want to be prepared for and grab the things that you don't need to know right now.
But at least you know that you don't need to know them right now. I think that would have probably have saved me so much time and energy in so many plans of like this is a need to know now this is a need to know later and need to know later is our perfectly fine.
Let's not focus all of our energy on that let's focus on the need to know now. Yes. Yeah. And the other things that will happen will come up when you need it. Yep. Again, we're just making it up as we go along. Yes. But we know that we're making it up as we go along. Right. Take it.
You're planning to make it up as you go along. I love it. Excellent. All right, Jay, what is your connection for the next month or no, since we're not doing it for a fortnight, we're doing this connection for the whole month.
By the time we record again, there will have been a decision made on if I am buying a house, which is it sounds like terrifying to say that. Yeah. So I just went and like did the math and know that that totally checks out. So again, my family is looking at doing a cross country move.
It's been this whole thing. I'm excited about it. There's there's a lot of factors that are going into that. This is a big plan. This is a plan that might be for the next few months. This is a plan that might be a year out, you know, if if we get into a property that has to be constructed.
By that time, I will know that part of the plan right now. I don't know that part of the plan. So for right now, I feel like my connection should be document the things that I need to be thinking about right now. And then also document the things that I need to be thinking about later.
And I am going to use a tool that I often don't that I try to avoid using, which is to do is to figure this out. And then there's a reason for that. Kathy and I have talked about this again. If you want to know why I chose to do this in this case. Wait a couple of weeks for that.
And then you will understand why I'm choosing to use that and why I'm not using what I want to use. It's a good one. It's a good one. I have discovered, you know, these hot girl walks are a thing. And I usually feel better about them when I do them.
But also my dog does so much better when she has a walk. This allows me to clear my mind a little bit. I usually will listen to music or possibly a podcast depending on my brain. And I come back recharged and ready to do whatever needs to happen.
And I am going to walk at least once a day within reason. With, you know, I am going to consider this a green check mark. If I have done at least three walks a week. With the gold to do more, but I know like this upcoming weekend, I'm not going to be home so I can't walk.
There's going to be a variety of different things that I know are going to come up. But the weather's getting nicer. It's not a million degrees, which is nice, but it's also not, you know, in the 40s.
So I think this walk will help everyone, including my dog, who is now sleeping because we took a walk before this podcast. I look forward to hearing you walking it out or at least talking about walking it out or maybe walking like you talk it. Wow. Is there a walk in your pocket? Oh, no. Oh, no.
