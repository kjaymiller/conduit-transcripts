From Relay FM, you're listening to Conduit, the show where we condo our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that occasionally trades in a host, but only for very good reasons. This episode is brought to you by Memberful.
I'm Kathy, and with me today is that most amazing robotic human that I adore so much. It's Alex Cox. Hello, Alex. Hello, bleep, bleep. I'm so glad to be here and honored that I get to be a stand in for Jay this week. Yes, Jay is traveling home as we speak.
In fact, today May 30th, from an undisclosed location for a secret project that I'm sure he will tell us all about in two weeks, or at least as much as he can legally say, because of course it's a secret project, which means it's secret.
But that's okay, because I have Alex here to keep me on track. So, just a couple of episodes ago, we started doing a this week in the Discord and last week in our co-working session. I wanted to hop in to say that the Discord this week is all about dub-dub. It's hardcore.
Last tag Apple is hoppin constantly. Can't wait to see how it is next week. But also the media section is really big because we've got a ton of shows whose seasons are ending or series finale is going on.
And so there's constantly, like, some shows have multiple, like, threads to talk about specific things and we've got games because of course Zelda's out and everyone's, you know, doing there's Zelda things and just all sorts of exciting stuff.
And then last week in our co-working session, all of the superconductors helped Razie work Railsy work on his CV, which for non-European people, that means his resume, including making decisions on present versus past tense.
What do you think? Should you use present or past tense when defining your job status or information or what you're doing in your job? I think that it should be past tense unless you're actively doing it.
So for a job that you're currently working, you can have both past and present tense depending on if you actively are working on it. I'd love to know what you think. So hang out in the discord with us and let us know. If any of those things sound like fun, you can visit IAMASuperconductor.
com to become a member today. Oh, Alex, let's get started. Wow. Wow. That was beautiful. Oh, thank you. It's like I'm a professional podcast. I know. Wow. Okay. All right. Are you ready to zap for me? Yes. All right.
Do I just, I don't know if there's anything behind the scenes or if it's just a zap? You should. I don't know. Zap from your soul. Woo. Okay. So I'm going to say, let's do our connection checks and you're going to zap for me. Okay. All right. Okay. It's time for connection checks. Zip. Woo.
That was a really good one. Sorry for, sorry, Javier for blowing up my mic. We love you, Javier. Okay. So my connection a month ago was to quote unquote, walk it out, which was basically to take the dog on a walk every day if I was home.
I am giving myself an orange circle because I did it a fairly significant amount of times. However, when I was gone for the last dance competition for the week, I came back so tired that I just kind of like forgot that this was my connection because it had been a month.
So like, you know, my brain just kind of ignored it and I forgot until yesterday. Yeah. Because ahead, it must, you know, be totally on top of all things when around like a ton of teenagers and then especially very talented teenagers, your mind should be totally fresh.
I don't know when that's exhausting. Not exhausting. Wow. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. So I was just thinking about it. But I, you know, I'm not giving myself a red X because I hedged my bets anyways like I do to make sure that I'm taking advantage of reality.
Alex, how did your connection go? Oh, man, speaking of reality, that's a difficult thing for me to live in and we'll talk about that later in the episode.
But my connection was to apologize to a friend of really FM switch on Merlin Man who is my co-host and works with me on a number of projects because my brain just hasn't worked well in the past year because of, you know, mental health stuff.
And I was like, there's an implied apology and an implication of I've messed up, but because it's a health thing, there's, you know, it's, he'll never be mad or orange. He'll be less mad than a normal person and not make me feel bad. Any more guilty than you would give yourself actually probably.
I would say I was going to skill to you. Yeah, exactly. Do for yourself. Yeah. And I just, we have always had this, it also because he, you know, talking about ADHD is also part of his job. So you know, that also affects us to some degree, but not as much as my stuff does.
So yeah, we've just always had a, a, a derf's standing that, oh, became less understood, I guess.
Like the more you sort of mess up and the more your brain changes, the more difficult it is for the other person because people can't, you know, as much as I would love people to read my brain, nope, take it back. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.
As much as there was like a, a small part of my brain, I wish people could check on. That's, that's not possible. So I apologize to him and it for like just the past year kind of sucking and for him being such a patient and wonderful friend and business partner and it freaked him the heck out.
But because, well, you should also probably not do that on air to someone, but if that's sort of the theme of your podcast challenge that week, like, yeah, I mean, it's very on brand. Yeah. Yeah.
So it was apology to also my self for being unkind to myself for the past year in a way that wasn't good to myself or to the people I care about. That's amazing. I'm super proud of green. Yeah. Baby. Yeah. Fishy Kai makes a very good point that Merlin takes apologies so well. It's very upsetting.
I don't like it. I don't like it. Anyways, let's get in to our conductors. Our favorite J of the show has a red X in the end life did life things and instead I spent most of my time traveling again, we give forgiveness for everybody and to themselves.
Hope that they are able to give themselves also forgiveness. And so we're going to move right on to our next conductor.
Alex, would you like to read out the next one? Am I, do I forget? Do I read the name or just the title the person has? There's no rhyme or reason we usually will go like title, then name and then connection check or at least that's how my brain does it. But you do you boo-boo however you want.
Oh, that's, that's all good. I didn't know if occasionally there was an op-sec issue. I didn't, didn't want to. No. Yuck anyone's yum and do a minor doxic I suppose. But identical twin of the show, Aaron McLeod, he slash him, connection check have a plan in place for my hiking trip.
So good through, through good learnings for next to, no, so the good learnings for next to time to sort his plan out sooner. I'm sorry, let me get close to this. Aaron, my bad, you're a great twin. I'm not a twin of the show. Have Aaron, hey Aaron, you're great.
His connection check is to have a plan in place for his hiking trip. So good through good learnings for next time to sort this out sooner. I think I got the one typo that I that broke my brain. Yes. Okay. It's good. You're doing great. You're doing great.
Our fish bear of the show, Fishy Kai says connection check, orange circle. Look, sometimes more important life and family things get in the way. I didn't manage to actually accomplish anything but I did set a few things up to make it easier to start a creative project.
I am so happy that you gave yourself an orange circle and because you did set things up. And so that is the most important part. That's how that's what we preach here at Conduit is giving yourself grace and being proud of the things that you do. So well done. All right.
Mountain Dweller of the show, Logan says, oh, the connection check has a green heart, love a green heart. And time with friends and family, I feel refreshed and relaxed. Oh, beautiful. Jealous. Right. Panda of the show, James says connection check, red heart times 20.
I said I should spend the month leading up to WWDC relaxing and playing Zelda. I have perhaps relaxed too much judging by the 85 hours I put into the game in just over two weeks. Don't do the math on that, but I'm still relaxed. Okay.
So I am confused as to why the red heart is here because it sounds like you relaxed and played Zelda successfully, which in my mind says that it's like a green heart times 20. And so I know you're in the chat right now, James, and I cannot wait. Okay. Okay. 20 hearts. It's a. Okay.
I was confused for me. James, I missed it. I'm sorry. I'm so proud of you. Yes. Green heart times 20. How about that? I'm literally the only person. I guess also you know that isn't playing Zelda. So I feel good. Wait, are you? Are you? I'm totally playing Zelda. Oh my gosh. I'm only. Listen.
I'm only like eight hours in. No, I'm not quite the James level, but we know the James is a big gamer. Like this is not new. I'm just glad that he is relaxing in there and not hurting his eyes too much.
And look, there's a whole bunch of people in the chat that are supporting you and you're not Zelda playing.
When I saw the red heart times 20, I thought it was because James has only played 85 hours because I know people who played football are more than that to the point where their health is not so much in a great place, but you know, that's their journey. Yeah. Yeah. I could see that.
I could see that. All right, distracted Colombian of the show Ramon, he slash him has a connection check with a red heart. I owe and it says I overestimated how other life surprises badly sprained my ankle two weeks ago.
Oh, no hard feels would affect my anxiety and block my intention to finish reading my short book. I'm not giving up and will continue to make it my mission to finish it. By the way, the book is no one writes to the kernel by Gabriel Gabriel Garcia Marquez. I owe that's on my list. Thank you.
Thank you, Ramon. That's so good. Push Alex to read the book and then we can have a little mini book club thing or something. I don't know. Anyways, moving on. Our Oracle of the show. So says green apple.
I've been managing reasonably well to balance too many projects and I even got to get go a bit better. And I even got to go away for a couple of days. So proud of you. So that's incredible.
I know you are going to take care of yourself as well and not work on too many at the same time, but I'm so proud that you were able to get away as well. I think they may ask, what's a green apple? This might be what happens when you listen to podcasts really fast.
Although I have missed a couple, but what's a green apple? Green apple is just like a green heart or a green circle. Some people like to do different shapes that are the color that they are picking. I thought it was a much fancier code.
You could have said literally anything and I would have been it. But I am not quite up to par for improv when there is a correct answer. Yeah. I didn't say you're with Alex Cox. Anything you can say is better at improv than I can do. The move. Are we are we moving on? It's my right.
The name list of the show Robert A has a green circle for I don't know. Rob Robert for their namelessness. Open house for the listing was scheduled and is now finished. Also summer break has been scheduled. Oh gosh, that's so cool. Oh, remember summer breaks.
Wait, you still have summer breaks because you have a teen. That's right. And the kind of. And I guess quote break. Yeah. Quotalcore break, right? Yeah, yesterday was Memorial Day in the United States. So they didn't have school and I, I mean, I did less work. So kind of a break. Question mark.
Yeah. Yeah. And the afternoon was spent at a friend's house inspiring them to do no yard work. So I feel like I get double points. So even though it was half the day, I still like gained back the first part of the day by having another person take a break, right? That's how that works. Huh? Sure.
Sure. Even though I think you might have done like double emotional labor, but I, you know, I'm not good at math. That's so. No. Maths is hard. We aren't making, we don't make a calculator app. That's other people. Oh, that's true. That's true. Yeah. Yeah.
Our train enthusiast of the show Rails, he says, connection check, green circle. I was meant to finish stage one of a massive project, but that wasn't going to work out. So I changed my connection to ensure I relax while I had COVID and my birthday week off and start writing a food diary.
So I can find my triggers.
 It might not be the habit I intended, but it's the habit I've slowly developed and that right there is exactly what the show is about once again, making it is 100% okay to change connections, especially ones that have like our month long to deal with the situation that you're in and give yourself permission to make adjustments to life as you need it.
I always think of a change in connection as a really satisfying like click like you're switching a train and you know, your little car goes smoothly into the other track and just like, I don't know. But a better noise than that. A metal noise and it's like, yes, perfect connection change. Perfect.
What is the noise made? All right. Train enthusiast of the show. No, no, sorry. I thought so excited. It's said train. It says a lot about me. I know that I was like train, straight, straights, but code monkey of the show Douglas. He, him short and sweet.
Yeah, it says gave myself a lot of meantime and just green circle all the way. Oh man, this is one of those where I'm just like, oh, I can't. I'm happy for you, but it's hard to relate for me. That is an aspirational goal. And I'm so happy for you code monkey. Yeah. I know.
Isn't it great? I love the name of the show names because they're so creative for the individual that comes up with it. And it's so fun. I love it. I love it. I love Alex that this episode of Condo it is brought to you by memberful.

Steven, what did you break? How are you can keep this in the show? Because Steven just hopped into the live chat and broke something with our live show. So hopefully it's working, which I just realized if it's not working, they can't hear me asking. Well, spoilers, I guess.
One of my focus modes, this is the custom one. I made just for conduit and allows my notifications from Relay. And I think I got a second ping saying that conduit was live. Yes. Double alive. Yes. Extra, extra. Two doses of conduit. But it's a check. Check. Sorry. Don't apologize.
Have to do that as Americans. But not conductors. No, no, no, that's true. That's true. That is very true. Okay, Alex, so for when I knew that Jay was going to be able to make this episode, I knew exactly who I wanted to invite, which is you. And that person wasn't available. And I'm sorry.
I've interrupted you. I'm sorry. I know how dare you. How dare you. But I knew if you were okay with it, what we wanted to talk about today. Because I know the last few years has been a big change in everything that you're doing in your entire life and your work, all of that.
And so I guess before we start, I do want to give a content warning because we will be talking about mental health, which is a common occurrence here on conduit. We're very open with all of the things that our brains are dealing with. But this one might end up being a little bit more. So heavy.
If it is totally fine, just skip to the next chapter, hear the connections at the end of the show and we'll talk to you next episode. No harm, no foul. We still love and appreciate you and we want you to take care of yourself. Just like Alex has with the changes that have come through. Oh, yes.
Do you, gosh, you have a whole man. I just, I think the audience needs to know that the big topic you have is mental health in the corporate world and when enough is enough. And I think the biggest asterisk in the world that I have never technically had a corporate job. Okay.
I should have said in the joby job world, like, I suppose. Yes. Sorry, I use the wrong word. You know, I know. No, no. Well, I have been out of the real like joby job world for so long that I just don't know the terms anymore. Well, I'll give some context only as to why that's important.
And because I do not have experience with that, since the my mental health stuff has either been with my own like pre adults days of college and, you know, doing my own thing. And that was fine. And then I went out into the work world.
And when you're working with a bunch of artists who also have mental illness issues, it's very different than working within like a big HR structure. So I guess like a tiny background of me.
I guess you'd say I'm very similar to Kathy and Jay when it comes to sort of hyper awareness of work and details and getting things done. But with another asterisk, my whole life is asterisk, like little but holes everywhere. And I was when I was 18, I was diagnosed as bipolar one.
And if folks don't know what that is, it's what was used to, it used to be called manic depression. Still sometimes is called manic depression. But it's when you have a obviously really high highs of mania and really low lows of depression.
But with bipolar one, the sort of mania you experience is I guess it's not so much that you are necessarily a grumpy or angry person. But I do absolutely grumpy or angry.
But there it's the level where it can be sort of like a psychosis where you're not necessarily fully in touch with the world's views. You can dissociate or lose track of for me, it's like this de-realization thing. Bobernam talked about it. Everybody, it's a very weird experience.
But along with, you know, not being able to communicate, some people have what are called godlike delusions. It's different for everyone. In my case, it was like sort of these strange delusions of, this is kind of funny. Like I thought my printer was literally out to attack me. It was my, it was a.
.. I mean, to be fair, seniors are really terrible and it would not surprise me. Yeah, there it is. And I was finishing my last paper for high school for AP English and got about Graham Green, a bipolar author. It was very, you know, all the asterisks aligned.
And I just had already been what's called ramping up. So getting like hypo-manic, overexcited, not sleeping, all of that. But then I started having like, you know, these paranoid delusions.
And then I ended up throwing a printer out to window, which again, pretty fair thing to do under normal circumstances. And in the movie office space. Yeah.
Or, but that was, that was the like, oh, this person who we all thought was, or rather is like this overachiever and works very hard in our context of what, you know, working hard and is successful means. Like this person needs help because, you know, not everyone has anxiety or a depression.
It doesn't always look like that. You can have a very serious mental health issue that is not visible most of the time.
And so during like college, because I was able, is that a sort of good summary of what a bipolar disorder is like occasionally, usually sometimes like once or month or so, having a manic episode in which you're really unwell. Some people are hospitalized.
I'm not as much anymore because modern medicine is great. Health insurance should be free in the US. And then, you know, there could be some depression around it, but it's not always a parent that I have to like any sort of anything going on. Is that kind of a good summary? Yeah.
I think it's also important to like point out that these, like you said, these are your symptoms and not necessarily anyone else's. Yes. And just like with any mental illness or any illness at all, it's going to manifest in different ways.
But if this is something that like you recognize in yourself, maybe talk to a professional just that if you can, if you're able to. Yes.
Especially because it used to be the like common, supposed common knowledge of, oh, this appears when someone is, you know, 16 through like 21, like a young adult, that has kind of been debunked. So no matter what age you are, talk to somebody. Yes. Yes.
The biggest thing that we want to share is that whatever you are going through in your brain, whatever your brain is doing as much as we hate our brain sometimes, they, it's the way that your brain works is valid.
And like you can get help to get it to work a little bit better, maybe, or easier for you to survive and succeed in the world that you want and that there's nothing wrong with getting help. In fact, it's a great thing. Yes.
I would not have been able to function or survive without the like talk therapy and stuff obviously, but there's great, you know, medications and stuff for whatever is going on with your brain.
And so once I had a pretty good, like I, it, and hey, another like disclosure that was important for me to realize is it can take a while. And so, oh, man, it took me a while to find the right amount of the, the right sort of cocktail of medication. And then in college, I did great.
My first year, not so much, I dropped out of like normal college. And the only reason that is important is because then I went to art school where I got to be the obnoxious overachiever that I was once again, because college is mostly about the learning how to exist in the world.
So I got to learn how to exist in the world and in the creative world. And the creative world has so many people who have mental health issues or are neurodivergent. And it's just a big mish of amazing creative brains.
And when immediately after I graduated, I, I had all this anxiety about going to what I was going to do. Like there were a bunch of options, but I chose to, wow, that's kind of like a humble bragg. No, I mean, like there was a bunch of different options.
My art school was like, I did film with a focus in documentary.
So I was like, okay, do I leave Chicago and do this wild like overseas documentary? Do I stay and do this documentary in Chicago? Or do I get a normal job with stable health insurance and stuff like that? And so I got a, I was offered a job in my hometown of Chicago at cards against humanity.
It's the, if you're thinking is that the dirty card game? Yes, that's what it is. As basically, um, Spackle, I guess is the best term of like doing what I do the best, which again, if you know my podcast self isn't, you wouldn't think this, but just solving any and all weird little problems.
And I'm very good at finding those possible weird little problems that could happen in advance.
And then eventually I was there, a studio director and what was, I don't know, it, they were b, unfortunately, a lot of us got laid off because my main job ended up being running an in person podcasting studio as well as a black box theater.
And in 2020, you were, there wasn't really anything you could do together in one space. So, um, yeah, in and around the office. Right, right. So if you're running an office and a live space and stuff like that, yeah, a reasonable.
But the reason I was able to be so I guess successful in that job is because, um, one at the beginning, we are, we're a very small company.
 And like I said, everyone don't want to break, I guess, friendship, HIPAA, but like, uh, I don't know any of my coworkers who have been talked publicly about mental health because, um, you know, since we all had full time jobs, we had the privilege of being able to do things that were difficult to do.
And I think it's a little bit more difficult to be able to speak about our, you know, our health candidly either, um, in talks or in some people's cases in their comedy or me in my podcast or whatever.
And that was, I mean, I never, ever expected that the plan was to hide any and all medical stuff, which I, I mean, you will get to why you shouldn't do that. But almost right away, um, because I had coworkers who were very open about their health, it was like, oh, this is a safe space.
And I was able to be like, Hey, I am taking my six days this week, but just so you know, here is why. And that's not something you should ever have to say to your employer. Like that is, it is illegal for your employer to ask that. Um, yes. But that was, again, there was like five people.
We didn't know what we were doing. Um, but that made me, that just made me realize, Oh, it's okay for me to take time off. For something that it is not physical. It is mental.
Um, so that was, and because, um, you know, a lot of my job also involved traveling and, you know, uh, hand, dealing with like difficult fans of the company, if anyone knows how video game people act, like we all know how some gamers are.
Um, but we don't sort of the entire company would need to take mental health breaks.
But, uh, so the whole, like corporate thing is because the company was so small, there was never any like, when you have a, like big corporation, there's HR in place and a lot of res, hopefully a lot of resources to deal with whatever sort of disability or health stuff you are going through.
And eventually we got a, like an HR person and all of that. And we learned all the things of, Oh, you don't need to, you don't need to talk about your mental health.
 In fact, if anybody asks, that's illegal, all of those things, um, which is, but it was a great, like having both of those perspectives was great because the only reason I was candid about my mental health and I was able to take care of myself was because I knew that, you know, my bosses were going through basically the same thing.
I'm going to say that again because I don't know if the mic picked up a bunch of things falling that my dad probably did. Um, um, I would have never openly talked about my mental health. Unfortunately, unless I knew that my bosses were going through their own stuff.
 So when I got to the point where we had like a real HR department and there was like 20 people working at the company, I shared less about myself, but that just felt, you know, normal with the exception of our HR department when I had to take a, um, disability leave, which is a thing that you, you should be able to do.
Look in your employee handbook or whatever. And, uh, realized like, oh, these are the resources I have, especially because we're kind of a real company now that I've been, um, that like I can do these things to take care of myself.
And one, I won't lose my job and two, no one will look at me any differently. And I know that that unfortunately is not always true in the real pearls because it sucks. Um, sometimes. Unfortunately, yes. But that was my experience.
And I think even if I had been, I don't know, even if I had been uncomfortable or felt ashamed in any way, like it would have made it even worse if I had not taken, um, uh, like it'd been candid about my health with our like HR department. Um, so that was great.
But the 20 to 20 happens, right? And, uh, it was honestly like the best year of my life, which is a dark, weird thing to say. But I was, again, like pretty much responsible for everything in my life. And I was doing great.
Um, and then after getting laid off, I was like, ah, I'm going to do the podcast thing full time. All right. Which then, you know, leaves you to once again deal with your mental health, but it only can sort of last so long before you might need some more help.
And the shame that people might feel about talking to their, um, bosses or HR, whatever, about mental health ended up with me. I was in a position feeling ashamed of talking about my mental health with my co-hosts or anybody I worked with because, you know, we're not in the same company.
They should not have to, they're not responsible for me. Like we are colleagues and, uh, uh, and it's just always made things worse. And I'm being, I'm not trying to be like vague. Like, uh, like I mentioned before, like completely losing track of time. Kathy knows this.
Like when you, uh, when I would have a manic episode, you know, there's no, unfortunately, there's, um, just not like huge clues as to when that might happen.
Um, and eventually it was like Kathy was like, Hey, let's come up with a system so that if I know you can't record, um, but you just can't respond fully for whatever reason, at least I'll know. And you were like, send me the, is it the scary mask emoji? That's what it's called.
We'd have to ask, uh, Federico, I think to really tell us with the name of that emoji. Yeah. But it's like the Japanese, um, not Kabuki mask, but like the, the, the scary red circle with hair mask thing. I don't know what it's called. Yeah.
I'm trying to put it in the, um, in the chat, but I'm literally typing like mask, Kabuki mask. I have like this slack like, Oh, thank you. Um, thank you. You really, really Japanese. Oh, girl, I don't know if that's just, uh, that's such a good name. Wow.
You picked a great, that's a great, uh, metaphor for mental, at least my mental health. That's awesome. You really picked a good one, Kathy. Um, actually picked it, but you know what? Oh, it works. Um, I just, I just said, pick.
Pick a emoji that when you, because I don't need to know, I didn't need to know specifics. I didn't need to know what was going on or when it might happen or whatever.
All I need to know was a that you were okay and be that like whatever we were planning on recording wasn't going to happen, which totally fine. Like being able to just know that you were okay enough, um, was super helpful for me.
And I really, I've actually implemented this type of code for other people too, uh, in my life. Um, and it's been, it's been really helpful. Uh, and so go us for figuring out a way to like help people. Right.
Um, and I, and I know it gets even hairier too when you're, you work with friends and almost everybody I work with is my friend. And that was true with my job, job and now not a jobbing.
You know, so because I, I don't know, it's, um, it, it feels weird to be like, everyone, please remember this is like an artistic field, which it's podcasting maybe not so much, but because that's where I came from, it was so common. Yeah. And that makes sense.
Like it wasn't as taboo, um, probably part of the reason I gravitated to that.
 Um, but I, I know how difficult it is for you and Merlin and anyone who has to communicate with, with me, but having, uh, stuff like, honestly, having automations in place to deal with my mental health has been, it has helped me deal since high school because I was a nerd, you know, way, yeah, it's shocking, right?
So it's shocking.
What happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? I know, another myth. No, no, no, no, no, no, they're myth.
Hey, don't be like, uh, they're, yeah, the, be, you can really lean into the nerdiness to, you know, how it makes your work life better, it can make your personal, physical and mental life better too. Go, go at it. Um, be yourself. You help.
And it's, I was going to make a self deprecating joke about myself and I'm not going to do it because you don't need to put something in the jar. Uh, yes, exactly.
Kathy, what's it like to be sort of on the other end? Because I mean, you are a, not just like you have your own brain stuff going on and you're a caretaker and you work with other people who have, you know, uh, squishy brains. We all squishy brains. Um, if you don't have a squishy brain, please.
Yeah, yeah, uh, who's brains are squishy in a different way. Yes. Uh, it's, it's interesting because I, how do I say this? I tend to attract people into my life that have squishy or brains. Um, but I, I try only to keep around the ones that also give back friendship.
Uh, this, I am a recovering people, please are and I say recovering because I'm actively working on it, even if I have to work harder on it some days than others. Um, but what that can do is it can be very dangerous with the people that you allow. Close into your life.
Um, and there's, there's always people that are willing to take advantage of that. And part of what I have learned over the years is how to balance what I need from a relationship to, um, in all of my relationships in my life and being able to communicate clearly.
What I need, um, I actually have a design in place for a communication is key branding thing for myself that I'm really excited about because I have been using it pretty much non stop. I say communication is key almost every day for like the last six months and it's important to be able to state.
Here's what I need from you, which was just like this emoji mask situation. All I needed to know was that you're not okay, but that you're okay enough to tell me that you're not okay. So I don't have to reach out to Maddie and be like, Hey, yes, is Alex.
Maddie's Maddie's my spouse who, um, is actually bipolar and has bipolar too.
 But, um, so he also knows what's up and unfortunately my friends often reach out to, uh, reach out to him when I am not communicating, uh, as my best self, uh, which is, um, you know, unfair and, uh, Kathy, what, what you said about attracting, like you don't, you're just a magnet for the different squishies.
Like, and, and I was able to tell that absolutely immediately and the like unfortunate and dark part of it is there are, like you said, people who see it and will take advantage of you or they will do it. They might even do it unintentionally and not realize it. Yeah.
This is not, it's not to say that people, um, like that, uh, find themselves taking advantage of, you know, people, pleasers and this type of, uh, emotional person are not always absolutely like. You can say, like I don't know.
Um, but, but that's unfortunately that that's the thing I was, um, before dealing with my, all of my stuff and like getting healthy, I was a maid, I was the worst because I knew exactly how to get what I wanted from people and still seem like a nice person and still.
Make it like doing, you know, all of those toxic behaviors and stuff people talk about that was just me to a T, but I was so good at it, you know, people did I was gone by this time people even realized it.
Uh, trying to think of like an example like it sounds like I mean things like, um, like getting a benefit like getting a favor from someone like film filming something, or getting someone to like, uh, help me host a fundraiser like I, it does all sound like really boring thing.
Yes, but you know, when you're, when you're like, uh, I was not trying to be nefarious, but I did not, um, I knew that I did not, I knew that I did not care about these people emotionally. I knew that I was just using them as a little play pieces and that's horrible. That's horrible.
I was not trying to be a butthole, but my brain was like, you can't do this, but you can get this person to do it. And, and that's how I survived. And that's I, I like had a conversation with Kathy. I'm like, you are too patient with me. And we can't have that. Otherwise, we will not be friends.
And I, because, well, because now I know like I will, uh, like I say that to a lot of people of like, no, no, no, you need to be, you don't need to be mad at me, but we need to, um, yeah, we can't sugarcoat the situation because even though it's no one's fault.
And even though it can't be predicted, it can't be prevented, you can still have things in place like our little emoji or other things that can make it the communication better and sort of.
Have the realistic expectations in place rather than like doing an Elon Musk and say, don't worry, Mars is going to be tomorrow. It's just it's going to happen. Everyone expected to happen.
And I think having those realization that having that realization and having those expectations is huge when you're in. I don't want to say a difficult relationship. I'm saying like for, for, I have that on both ends with other people who, um, you know, it's not just mental health.
It can be anything. If someone I can't, I mean, I can't even think of a good example mostly because I've tried to iron out any of those relationships in my life because unlike Kathy. I only like to please people when I, I only wanted to please people when they could give me something in return.
And I have a feeling that, uh, that happened a lot with you, Kathy, not hopefully not with me, but with other people. Yes, that there was definitely a significant period of time where I just gave, gave, gave without, you know, caring for myself necessarily. Um, and that wasn't healthy.
And I am trying to be better. I, well, I, I think I've seen you get better at it, especially like putting those boundaries in like I, I, I got mad, not mad at you. But I literally was upset.
I'm like, you can't be this patient when like, like, I was like, no, this is not a good thing that you're doing. And it made me worry.
I'm like, do you do this? Like, are there multiple people who are like flaking on you and just being a terrible friend? Like, is this a normal pattern of behavior? Why are you doing this?
Well, and it is, I think the reason that I have this level of patience because it's not always just so, you know, like I am definitely get frustrated and, and whatnot.
But part of what fills my cup and makes me feel loved is being able to support people. So it's a deep, it's a deep part of my soul to be able to help my friends. And additionally, I have a lot of patience because that sounded really like, no, that's exactly how it is.
I have a lot of patience because in my real world, it's difficult for me to allow myself to get frustrated with my situation as a caregiver to my spouse. Like, this, it's a constant, for example, when we came back from a dance competition long weekend, the front door was locked.
And I didn't take the key and I had mini soup go around the back to come in through the door. Like, the sliding doggy door thing so that they could get us in because my spouse wasn't like answering the door.
And our one of our dogs specifically Jose Cuervo, who is my spouse's emotional support dog was freaking out. And that made mini soup freak out.
And so in that moment, when the door opened and my kid was crying and holding the dog, I mentally was running through like the steps of what to do in an emergency.
So getting ready to call 911, getting ready to find somebody that could come take care of the dogs if we were going to be gone for a while. Or like what needed to happen if the situation was as bad as my brain immediately went to turns out they were just asleep.
Sleeping really, really hard and didn't hear the door. And the dog was just excited that his baby was home. Oh, and so all of that was for nothing. And but those, this is a bigger example of kind of the basic everyday low level anxiety that I live with.
Um, that it's difficult to, like not give up necessarily because it's something that I kind of have to have. But it's, it gets really frustrating and I can get angry and frustrated like anyone can for little things that are not everyone's daily life.
You know, having to fill medicine, having to take care of your nose, having to, you know, remind somebody to bathe. Like these are all things that are not in everyone's day to day and it builds up and builds up and it can break and be really damaging for everyone involved.
And so I've actually started trying to take more mini breaks by taking a weekend away and just kind of spending time with friends. And this has been really hard for me because it means that I am asking for something, which is hard.
And even if it's just, hey, can I sleep on your couch for a couple days so I can get out of my house. That's in my budget. I can, you know, pay for, pay for food and, and help clean around their house and, and just like sleep on their couch and take a break.
And that's been really helpful and I've been giving myself this permission to not feel guilty about it and most of the time that works. So, you know, something's working.
What I sort of, I mean, I am not a full-time caregiver and sometimes step into that role with folks who have a similar mental illness as I do, but have gotten to the point where they, their brain is so manic or psychotic that they just, you know, they can't use the bathroom.
They can't use the bathroom themselves or they can't talk and I just, not only, I usually not only think about what I have been like, I've almost been in those situations before and then I also think about, you know, how Kathy deals with it.
And I mean, that's always a huge, like I don't want to, like, that makes a sound that I was, sound like I'm like, oh Kathy, it's like, oh Kathy, because I know I've seen you now take care of yourself as well as the people around you and that's been such an amazing thing.
I think for me as your friend and for people who listen to this show, knowing that you have all of this stuff, but you are still a successful happy unicorn who can accomplish and make so many wonderful things.
And I mean, that's also what I need to remind myself that I am not defined by the things that go on and on. I'm a brain that I can't control.
Yes, you are not defined by any illness or situation or life happenings, but by who you are as a person and what not just what you provide to the world because that sounds very transactional.
And if you listen to Roboism, you know, capitalism is the devil and blah blah blah blah blah, but what, what, how you are able to live your life. And what you can do to take care of yourself as well as provide a service to humanity by existing. And that's why I've been much to Merlin Shagrin.
I started doing like attempt doing like gig economy jobs, door dash and stuff, maybe to do some union stuff too, but I've been very afraid to start a new job.
I mean, I've been doing a job job because I've accepted I need health insurance, but also, I mean, there's a whole other thing of when you're bipolar and also trans and like amazing jobs are in Missouri. It's like, what the heck are you going to do? But that is a different episode.
We've been to two headed girl everybody. That's a podcast I do with my spouse.
But I, you know, realizing again, like, you, if I don't take steps to take care of myself, it might start to define me and the people who are less patient and less understanding might also unfortunately start to associate that with me. And that that is an absolute terror I have.
And it shouldn't be. But, you know, that's why, you know, I love communication is key. And like I'm so excited for dab, dab, dab. And next week because it's, it's mostly, not mostly, it's like a work occasion type of thing.
But I haven't seen most of my friends in three years and like, yeah, I haven't, I haven't been near large body of water. I just, oh, I'm so excited to just go west and touch the ocean. Go west, young friend. Yes.
Do you know that the phrase go west, young man, was said by one of my ancestors? What? And technically that, like, that's not exactly what the phrase is. I don't remember the exactly, but Horace Greeley said it. A creator of the New York Tribune, who has a statue in New York City.
Is my great, great, something grand uncle. Oh my gosh. I'm like Starstruck. My goodness. Oh, Kathy's from the old world. Mama. He ran for president against Ulysses S. Grant. And it made the only presidential candidate to die before the electoral college comes in. Oh my gosh.
God, I feel like your ancestors were probably like a bonus or might still be a bonus on like the AP US history exam in the United States. Yeah. Oh my gosh. I know that my kid talked about Horace Greeley in eighth grade. So, you know, it's a real thing apparently.
Oh, so what you're saying is you're a nepotism baby. Yes, I am. Definitely a nepotism baby. And my kid was able to pass the test because they're like, um, that's my great, great, grand uncle. That's amazing. Oh my gosh.
Ramon says, so in the chat, we have a link to the Wikipedia and Ramon says that he sees the resemblance. And I think it's the wispy hair coming out of the ears is really the family resemblance there. God, I'm so happy. This is a long Wikipedia page two. This isn't some like footnote day.
No, it's not Jason.
 No, which you can listen to our favorite Wikipedia discoverers of in the, uh, ingenious members special in the member special feed relay crossover feed, which you can access in your memberful account, um, by logging in and connect to crossover and, uh, this month and next month are all, uh, it's members special time.
So you get to have all sorts of fun extra episodes from some of your favorite shows or you can find a new show to listen to and, uh, discover kind of some new hosts that you might enjoy and like, um, you know, hang out with them in your ears. How's that for a little bit of a, uh, what a plug.
Yeah, as professionals. Was there anything else that you wanted to say on this topic? No, thank you for listening to me. And thank you to the folks who are listening to this episode. I hope that there were some thread of thought that could be followed. And if not, that's a big deal.
A little bit of how my brain works sometimes. Yeah. Exactly. Oh goodness. All right. Well, with that, let's head over to our next connections.
Alex, do you have a connection? I am trying to connect with a, like, I, this, I'm actually trying to connect with the healthier version of myself that is, you know, the person who takes care of myself when I am traveling and who doesn't, um, push myself past my limits.
So during, uh, dub, dub, like, I'm going to take breaks from people and get a full night of sleep at least once. Yeah. I mean, we can't ask for the possibility.
No, no, actually, I'm going to say at least at least twice because, um, and, and I'm hoping to be, uh, hopefully we'll hang out with some relay listeners and just get more, not post COVID, obviously, but, um, just be more present in the real world's next week. I'm excited for that.
That's, uh, that's such a good connection. That's perfection.
Um, so now that the dance season is over, um, my kid will not be, uh, having to spend several hours at the studio, um, which means we can get back into our habit that we had talked about doing, but we'll do it more often of using the gym memberships that we have together.
So we will, until school is out, at least we will be, uh, at least a few times a week. Uh, I will meet them after school at the gym, which just happens to be right down the street from their school.
So we will go work out together and then I will drive them home and I am excited to uh, kind of try and get that habit back in, especially during the summer when they have even less dance, um, and to kind of keep their endurance going so they don't have to rebuild it when dance does start again.
Uh, so that is my connection for the next fortnight. So wholesome. I like it.
And our conductors, conductions, uh, this is Jay of the show, um, would like, we'll be doing the minimum and adjust to new commitments, which I can't wait to hear what those are in two weeks when I get to talk to my buddy Jay again. Yay.
And then if you want to start with the next one, I don't know if I am so sorry, Javier. Uh, oh, there you, there it is. Um, I am doing errands. Thank you. There we go. Yay. All right, identical twin of the show, Aaron. Hello again. New connection.
Continue work on my side project to get close to a workable demo. Oh, that sounds so cool. I want to know what the demo is. It's okay. I don't need to know what the demo is, but that's really exciting. It's always exciting when you get to the demo stage in whatever you're doing. Haha.
Uh, fish bear of the show, fishy Kai says new connection reconnect with the previous connection. And I am scrolling up to see what it is and uh, start starting the creative project. Yes. Super excited.
Now that you've set it up to go forth and be awesome, you can now be even awesomer by uh, working on it. Amazing. Listen, I know it's mountain dweller of the show, but my brain keeps saying mountain doer of the show. So uh, mountain doer of the show, Bahablast's logang, this is new connection.
Normal life is back first up on my habit tune up physical health. I'm going to work out consistently this fortnight. Don't miss two days in a row with flex emoji. Oh, it's a human flex emoji. Not a robot one. Fine. I guess. That's okay. I really like how you phrase that logang. Logang.
Um, not missing two days in a row. That's super like, I feel like that's a really healthy way to kind of look at it. Of, you know, not looking at the number of times that you did it, but trying to hold it to giving yourself an opportunity to only miss one. I think that's really great.
Uh, our panda of the show, James says as of dev dub, it's the start of the new apple year. I need to remember that not only is it a marathon rather than a sprint, I don't actually have to run the race at all if I don't want to.
Let's see how things go on Monday and I will try not to overload my brain in the meantime. Yes, you are in charge of this. You are the boss. You can choose to ride a bike on the race on this marathon or go horseback.
You know, you can, you can choose how, how you want to do this or, you know, take a nap. Also an option for the race. I know how exciting calculators in VR can be, but it's okay. I don't need to do that. I don't need to do day one. Oracle of the show, a sofa, next connection.
My busy time is about to get even busier. My plan for the next fortnight is just to keep my head above water. Oh, I love that. Yes, just realistic, like, expectation and just like forward motion. Love it. Yes. Uh, nameless of the show, Robert says new connection.
As I am back to working for my home office finally, I am challenging myself to keep up with the sleep schedule that I used when commuting. Yes, this is the return of an old connection.
I want to use this time to do some self-care and make sure that I'm ready for my day by going out on a walk, eating breakfast, or simply changing it to something that is not my sleeping clothes. Also exciting new development. My family has welcomed a new member, puppy emoji.
Now that we have our puppy in the home, I want to make sure that I equip her area with all the toys and treats she needs as well as a camera that will let my life, my wife, watch the doggo while she is in the office. Okay, so first off, we need puppy tax.
We need to see this sweet, sweet baby girl who is the best girl and the best doggo. But also we can hopefully see, I'm excited to see how taking care of yourself will work really well in the next fortnight. Oh puppies. Train enthusiast of the show. Really, really real Dave. New connection.
Get back on the Duel Lingo train to learn Dutch. Also keep an accurate food diary for the next episode. I have some ideas of what it might be, but time will tell. What? And lastly, our code monkey of the show. New connection. Organize my office. Nice simple, basic. I love it.
If you would like to submit a connection, you can do so in the relay discord in the hashtag show follow up channel by starting your message with a conduit emoji and putting your connection after. If you are not in the discord, you can still submit your connection.
You can go to the feedback area or share some regular feedback there by clicking the link in the show notes or using the submit feedback button at relay.fm slash conduit. Or you can also go straight to relay.fm slash conduit slash feedback. But that's too many slashes.
