From Relay F.O. you're listening to Conduette, the show we Condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduette, the show that sometimes forgets what we're here to do. This show is brought to you by Memberful and P. Is it really just P? Yep, yep, yep. I love it.
It's a hydration app. Okay, P. I saw a dot there. There's a period in the notes. I was like, P, period. I'm Jay, nice to meet all of you listening. And with me is Kathy. Hey Kathy. Oh, that's me. That's me. Hi. Hi. I'm here. Are you here? I think so. I warned Kathy. I might be low energy.
I've been in meetings all day. Hooray. But Kathy, what happened this week in the discord? Yeah, this week one of the main things we did was we celebrated our very own package cowboy of the show.
Got an email from Tim Cook after he sent a notification, like a email about like how his Apple Watch helped him in a health issue and got a director fly. And there was a lot of conversation around whether it was like from a team member or not.
And the idea is if it's signed best comma, Tim Cook, it's usually is straight from Tim. So that's pretty pretty frickin cool. So yeah, yay. Ray, maybe we'll learn more about about that story at like a WWDC event. Yeah, maybe. Yeah, maybe. Surprise.
And then in our co-working, which we do in our off weeks, we just kind of vibed. Like we, we did some stuff. We asked, we did our normal thing of asking AI questions and getting goofy answers. We talked about cat herpes, how that's a thing and how my cat has it. Yeah. And mine too.
It's a lot of my own. And it's not sexually transmitted. Yeah, our cats have never met in real life. I don't think anyone was thinking that they shared it with each other. But okay. You never know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
So if that sounds interesting to you, one, you should probably talk to someone. But you. Yeah. Talk to us on the off weeks. Exactly. And yeah, you should visit I'm a super conductor.com. That's letter I letter M letter A. Super conductor.com and become a member today. We got a shout out from.
Yeah, we did. And the identical twin of the show, Aaron. He said, love the story of growth and learning through doing repairs with my father-in-law. Kathy, I hope you sort the post show things out soon and you feel better. Yeah.
So if you're not sure what we're talking about, what post show things after, you know, we have a topic that we talk about. But then we have another topic that we talk about in our after show.
So if you want to hear about the, the super secret after show topic, which is usually related to something going on in one of our lives that's kind of time relevant, then yeah. Again, I'm a super conductor.com become a member today. Now it's time for the connection check. Kathy.
Oh, we're bringing Zapps back. I don't know. I just felt like you needed a Zapp to enlighten and lift up your energy. And honestly, that made my, that made my next hour. So yeah, we're good now. I'll take it. I love a good zap. Said no one ever said you. So me.
Kathy, did you clear off your desk and clean your office? Or did you clear your office and clean your desk? Okay. So I, being me, forgot specifically what my connection was. And instead of looking it up, I was just like, oh, it's clear to, clearly, to clean my office.
In fact, my connection was to clear off my desk in preparation for my tiny Mac. But I didn't do that. But I did clean my office in a significant way, which is really like, it's the better option. And so I, but it's not, it's not fully done. I've got like three quarters of it done.
Just the corner under my desk, under my window is real bad. But those are like boxes of stuff that have morphed there. So I will be. I'll be working on that later. But I'm giving myself an orange circle because I changed my connection in the middle of the conduit two weeks. And I can do that.
And you can too. One of the things that I feel is really cool is when we've talked about how like having that connection and having that accountability. I often use it as a thing of like, hey, here's the thing that I really got to do. And it really only takes me 15 minutes to do.
And then I can look at it and go, oh crap, I need to do that. And then I do it really quick, which again, totally valid way of using your connections. But also this time around, no, no, Mac, please don't. My Mac wants to try to update. I'm like, oh, now right now. Stop. Thank you.
I was like, what are you doing? Stop. I'm fine for this week was focused on new management tasks. For those that don't know, I got promoted to a management position on my team. And I'm trying that out and figuring out how that works. And I think the challenge for me is finding balance.
And I still have to do some of my old tasks. And the things that were my old tasks were the things that I'm used to, the things that are fun. Management tasks, it's a lot of planning and a lot of thinking and a lot of writing process and policy and stuff. And I'm not saying that it's not fun.
It's just not the fun that I'm used to. But I was able to actually like come to a point where I was like, I really need to focus on what's going to be important. And it wound up being those new management tasks.
So without really thinking too much about my connection check, I'm just, I'm happy to say that I did do it. And maybe that's like a sign of growth when it comes to the productivity of for me, especially right now as I'm kind of having to balance priorities between my old role and my new role.
Yeah, I think that's definitely a sign of growth and an adjustment and it's going to take some some work and that's okay. Yeah, what about our conductors? Yeah, so our package cowboy Mike says connection check.
Checkmark have been mostly successful with the daily routine updates, barring a few missteps. I love that you gave yourself a check, even if it wasn't perfect because that is life and life is not perfect.
And our other Mike are checklist enthusiasts of the show Mike says also check focused on getting office closet organized not only did I reorganize my closet, but I also cleaned up my desk and media stand way to go stretch goals.
I wrote a carl of all trades at the show carl says connection check green book. I wrote the code, talked to the people and made progress toward being ready for running the contest still work to be done, but I'm scheduling that out and delegating well done.
Our soprano of the show debo says I mended the torn sheet. That was a green heart. Check podcast listener of the show, Pillix says connection check yellow circle. I haven't worked much on the mod, but I did a bunch of chopping. Oh, I'm guessing shopping for my upcoming ski trip well done.
I still want to think he's, Pillix is making his own skis. Yeah, chopping it from the trees. I'd actually chop the wood and make the skis. That is a very Canadian thing. That is a very Canadian thing.
Our shark of the show one pair of shoes says last connection from long time ago was to figure out what my 2025 yearly theme was going to be. I did figure it out and I call it the year of and there's nothing there. So I think that might be. It was edited. It was edited. It was.
The year of reduction. The year of red, it was reduced so much we even took it out of the name. Nice.
Our robotics engineer of the show eight in says connection check green check mark little did I know when I wrote my last connection that the Canadian winter would actually help me keep my connection to or three but who's counting snowstorms later.
And I can definitely say that I moved way more than usual. I just want to point out that I would be about to for another trip up north only to find out that there was a plane crash at the airport. I usually land in when I go to Canada and I am not happy about that at all.
Yeah, that's a little little stressful. I don't think anyone truly I don't think anyone else is happy with it either.
Yeah, but what do I know? It's been the the year of plane accidents and currently my my wife and child are across the country and will be flying and I will be flying a couple of weeks. So I am not an anxious flyer at all. But right now right now a little more anxious than usual.
Yeah, yeah, understandable, understandable. Our nameless of the show nameless says green book and cap. Oh, is this the best news we've ever heard? The final project has just been approved.
I have finished all my schoolwork and now I'm waiting for my appointment with the counselors to finalize my graduation application. Also, the water heater repair ended up being covered by my homeowners insurance, making the call, making the call and talking to a real person worked.
Hopefully it covers the full amount. That is awesome. Congratulations and congratulations. The of the show, you said that right as I yawned. So you're new. Yellow circle, the floor piles were dealt with, but the stuff I wanted to hang up on the wall remains not on the wall. It's okay.
That's the next one. And our fish bear of the show, Fishy Kai says green circle. I have attempted time tracking. I'm going to stick with it for a bit, but building the habit of starting the timer is hard. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. I'm glad that it worked for you. It definitely did not work for me.
Yes, monetizing a passion takes work. You have to have the right platform in place to build a membership business that's best for your audience, but it's hard when you're already busy with work and other projects. That's why Memberful makes it simple to build and run a membership business.
Memberful lets you offer membership perks and exclusive content to your loyal followers, and you full control over who has access to your blog posts, newsletters, online courses, podcasts, private community chats, and more.
With seamless checkout via Apple Pay and Google Pay, your audience can sign up and start reading your private posts or listen to your exclusive podcast episodes within minutes. I love Memberful because it is so, it is truly so flipping easy to go in and send every two weeks.
We send our email with a reminder about the co-working session. It's so easy. I have a snippet that just puts in the information with the right date, and then I quickly and easily choose who it goes to, just conduit members, and then publish. That's it.
That sends an individual email to all of our superconductors, so they know how to join our superconductor co-working sessions. You know something great, Kathy? What? Something great, Jay. I don't have to think about Memberful, which is truly like a benefit to how awesome it is.
I've worked with so many other membership platforms in the past, and it's just like every five seconds. I'm like, oh, I need to go do this. I need to go click this button. Oh, I need to go over here and do this other thing.
Not only do I have an amazing person named Kathy who does a lot of the membership stuff, so I don't have to. But also, I've never had a concern or problem where I've had to be like, oh, someone go kick the Memberful machine again and make it work.
The fact that it's just working is such a benefit, and it allows us to focus on creating content, and doing the stuff for our members instead of having to manage that platform. Monetize with a partner, not a platform.
Whether you're launching, growing, or switching platforms, Memberful is committed to providing exceptional support at every stage of your journey. With Memberful, you're not just getting a tech solution, you're gaining a trusted partner, ready to offer personalized guidance from setup to strategy.

We had talked a little bit in the last episode about just some of the different communication skills and some of the breakdowns that happened. So, yeah, no, by all means, take it away because Kathy, you are one of the best communicators that I know. Full stop.
Honestly, one of the best compliments I've had in a very long time, because I take communication very seriously, not necessarily that it all has to be serious, but with the belief that it's very rare that over communication is something. Because there's so, listen, I can't read minds.
I know, I know shocking, shocking, still not able to read minds. And with that, I find it very important to make sure that there's nothing. Do my best, shall we say, to make it so that things are not misunderstood.
Whether that's like sending a message, hey, I know we talked about doing X for this weekend. Can we confirm that that's happening, what time, etc.
I want to know the details, I want to know the information, and that includes what's in your brain, not in a creepy way, but in a, I want to make sure that expectations are being met. And that means that I don't, I don't want to disappoint people.
Yes, that's part of my people, please attend at C's, I'm aware, working through that, yada yada yada. But it means that there's a lot of, a lot of things that you can do to try and, and make sure that expectations that you may not understand are being discussed or even met by asking the questions.
I think that's the hard part is, you know, I've talked about kind of being in this new role, and there, there are a lot of demands that I think people, people didn't genuinely know who to, to communicate them to.
 And in that, like, I've seen kind of two patterns of behavior, I've seen the, I'm just not going to say anything, and then all of a sudden something is due, and they go, oh, that actually wasn't supposed to be me, that's someone else, and then now it's like falling on my plate, and like, oh, hey, can you have this thing for two days from now?
And that's stressful.
But I think being able to effectively communicate is probably one of the biggest ways, and we talk, we talk about saying no a lot. I think community, like being in constant communication makes things like saying no easier. But I also think it, it helps to build up an expectation.
And I think like a great example of that is, I do a lot of one on one, it's not just with members of my team, but with other people in, you know, in the company.
And every once in a while, I'll be like in a call, and I'm like, why is this person not here? And then like, we go down to the conversation, they're like, oh, well, oh, I didn't even know that this is a thing that was happening. I'm glad I have all this input.
And it's, it's like that constant barrier of if everyone isn't being openly, if everyone isn't openly communicating about stuff that's happening, then expectations can get built up. And it's not that someone didn't care. It's someone usually just didn't know. Yeah. Yeah.
So often it's not necessarily like, yes, it's something that you can work on. But if you don't know to work on it, you don't know to work on it.
If you grew up in a family that maybe didn't talk about things or didn't communicate very well, maybe, you know, answered, you know, a question with, oh, well, you know, you'll, I'll tell you when you're older, or you don't need to know this now, or, you know, because I said so type of a thing.
You, you haven't had practice. You don't know how to, how to communicate. And so it becomes a trial and error as you grow up being able, like, needing to go in and, and learn how to communicate. And it's something that, like, it is something that can take a lot of energy to get right.
And you're always going to have it a little bit wrong too, because everyone communicates a little bit different.
But in my situations, all of the communications that I've had, I've never been sad that I didn't over communicate, whether it's just a, hey, you know, a little thing of, you know, I would go to, I was going to an event with friends.
And my brain, those silly brain bees were spiraling into what if I'm wearing the wrong thing? Did it matter? No, it wouldn't have been the end of the world. Like, it wasn't, it was just like, an event. So it's not like it was a red carpet or like hanging out at someone's house.
It was like going out in public just enough to where my brain was like, mmm, I'm not sure what this is. So I texted the friends that I was going with. And I was like, hey, my brain is not, you know, letting me settle down.
What are you guys wearing to this event? It was easy enough to just put that vulnerability out there, making it on me. So it's not like, hey, I need to know what you're doing so much as I need to call my own brain. I need to do what I can to make this easier to deal with.
And that includes coming in and just asking the question. Again, I've never had a bad experience, even with, even with like clients and bosses in the past that have had, you know, that are very not rude. But in that, oh, don't ask me questions that you already know the answer to.
Don't bother me with stuff. If I frame it in a, hey, I'm just confirming this. So you're not asking how something works or permission to do something, just getting an okay that like, hey, I'm doing this right now. If that's cool, like, just take the two seconds to read this.
And if that sounds great, send it on over. Like that's, that's fine. I'm just getting that granted I've never worked with, you know, devil wars product level stuff. But it's, it's usually an okay thing to come in and just ask for clarification. People appreciate it.
And, and it's taken a lot of work, but it's not something that I am sad that I'm working on. I also think that there's something to say about the like standards of communication.
Like I think that there are some things that for perfect example, Kathy, while you were explaining all of that, my boss was texting me saying, hey, what's the status on this other thing that I was asked about on Friday, in which I said, I will have that information for you next week.
Yesterday was a holiday, and I was off. And then today I was called into a six hour meeting. So yeah, yeah. And that's when you reply with, you know, hey, I haven't had an opportunity to work on it because of a six hour meeting. Exactly. Exactly.
And again, like, it's in my boss listening to this, which I don't think you do. But if you do, like, thank you for these opportunities.
And also a way that I could have probably have set a better expectation was specifically ask, hey, I plan on giving, I plan on getting this update during our one on one, when do you need that by because our one on one's are usually scheduled on Tuesdays.
Again, because of the meeting, it got pushed to tomorrow. So a part of it was just like, hey, I can get that to you tomorrow. Here's what, here's what happened, whereas if I just, you know, if my boss was like, hey, where's this information that I asked you for last week.
And I just go, oh, sorry, I got busy. Like that, that doesn't. One, that that comes off that doesn't come off the same way. And it makes it feel like, because even if I go like, oh, I haven't gotten it yet, like that, that still doesn't feel great.
Whereas if I would have just relayed the like, my plan is to do this. Is that okay? Because then when you ask and I go, well, the plan was to do this. Unfortunately, this hasn't happened yet. And this is when it does happen so that I can get that information to you.
I think that like the way that these things that communicated are so important, but a big part of that is figuring out how do you, how do you pre-communicate or how do you pre-plan or just establish that communication like questionnaire.
So that in the future, you're not trying to have to like talk, I guess, around the fact that like I think just hasn't happened yet. Especially when it's not even your fault. Like that's always the worst is when it's like someone expects you for something.
And due to no fault of your own, like you just can't provide that thing for them. That's miserable. It's so exhausting and it feels like you failed, but it's a good reminder that it's not necessarily your fault. And that doesn't make it better necessarily.
Like it's not easier by not being your fault. But it can kind of help your setup to be like, hey, I want to try and do better and do what I can. But that means that I'm not going to be able to do this thing for you. Or this isn't going to work the way that you want it to because of XYZ.
Like just being able to sit there and be like, you know, again, that communication of I want to make sure that you know where I'm at, that you know, you know kind of what's going on or what I'm able to do.
So that nobody else is, like, I guess sad is the wrong word, but like, you know what I mean? You want to make sure that everything is moving the way that it can. And part of that might be, you know, not just that you're not throwing people under the bus.
That's the important thing to remember is that by communicating, hey, what's blocking you, you're better opening up opportunities to make sure that the stuff gets done that you need to get done.
Yeah, I love the fact that like our team started doing these regular standups and their formulated in a way that is. We're not here to question what you're doing or how you're doing it.
Like this isn't this isn't that well, like we're questioning what you're doing, but it's not like time to question. It's time to communicate. It's time to say, this is what I'm working on. And here's kind of a quick status update on all the things.
And it's weird because there are often times where it'll come up and go, I'm being blocked because I'm waiting on such and such to do a thing. And the answer is never, oh, well, I didn't, the answer is just like, okay, well let's connect after this or let's connect.
And then we put some time on a calendar and figure out what's next or hey, I'll send you a message on Slack. We've established in the rules. This isn't the time to give one to one updates. It's more time to say, this is what I'm doing. This is where I feel I'm blocked.
And if there is a quick solution to that, then let's take that outside of this. Because I think that the challenge that pops up is I've had so many times where like my boss has said, hey, what's the status on this or like a boss, not even my existing boss again, I like my existing boss.
I like my old bosses to their okay. This isn't me pandering. It's just being upfront. I mean, they definitely do listen to this show. Absolutely, absolutely. But I've had those moments where I've had someone ask me for a thing just out of nowhere.
And I give them an answer only for them to ask me again. Because when I had to give them an answer, it wasn't, it wasn't like the right format. It wasn't the right medium and it definitely wasn't the right time and place.
Or someone was like, hey, what's the status for dead? Oh, it's this, this, this, this. Okay, cool. Thanks. And then two days later, what's the status of dead? It's like, I told you. I just told you.
So just making sure that you're like frequent and often communication, but communicating within the space and like communicating the right way or the way that people are expecting.
And I guess Kathy, that was going to be a question that I had for you too, was that you're often working with people who are kind of extremely busy. Do you have rules of communication like, hey, I need you to send me emails. Like, I don't, don't call me.
Don't text me like, this is going to get dropped if you don't send me this or understand that if you send me this, like, I'm going to respond. But I'm going to respond within like certain time frames.
I've only had to do some sort of guidance for that in a situation where I had a client that would just be, hey. And then not reply.
So I would reply on Slack being like, hi, what, you know, what, what do you need? I'd start my timer because I'm time tracking and I'd sit there and 15 minutes later, they wouldn't have replied.
And it's like, okay, this, the third time this happened, I was like, I want to set up some guidelines and some boundaries of like, I am more than happy to have these conversations with you.
But I need to know, is this work or are you asking me how I am? I don't mind either way, but I need to know like how important is this? Because I also, my ADHD manifests in the way that switching context is how my brain works the best. So I have my email open the whole time.
I know, okay, is this going to take a long time to reply? Cool. I'll wait later. But is this a yes or a thank you or I'll make sure that they get it and then forward it to the right person. Short, quick, easy, great.
And that like kind of relieves my brain bees a little bit so that I can go back to doing the work thing that I'm working on. And so it, but overall, my method of communication for my clients is whatever way my clients want to communicate because I have no preference.
But it's defined like they, they've told you what their preferred method is. Correct.
Because I am communicating with them and I'm asking, hey, when this happens, do you want me to put it in our notion? Do you want me to email? Do you want me to slack? Do you want me to text? Like I communicate with clients over all sorts of apps.
And I am okay with that because it does add context clues so that I'm sending the right information to the right person. But it's also make sure that they know, hey, if I need Kathy, I'm going to do this. I'm going to add in a son of a task and assign it to her.
Have it for today and then she can move the deadline. Like that's how it works.
And again, that's something that's communicated when we're discussing things of like, where do you want this feedback? Where do you want these things? I like to have weekly calls with some of my clients so that we can have these checkups and there's work that does throughout the week.
But we're checking in just in case there's something else or like getting feedback on a project or whatever is happening is going to, you know, get that communicated. And it's important to me that everyone knows where they stand on all of the projects. I have to, well, two things.
One, hey, hey, conduit people, please become superconductors because I wish I had the ability to have a weekly follow up with Kathy. And I'm not saying that it would be a thing that was public.
But what I would be saying is that we were making significantly more money off of conduit than I think that we would probably communicate about more. But also, I am also thankful for the fact that you let a lot of our communication just be through I message.
Like I have had conversations with like Mike and Steven about how they have like an I message and then they have Slack and then all the relay stuff goes in the Slack and then all the like we're friend stuff goes in.
The, you know, I message and I just, I just have to be the person to say that like I am much better at being able to compartmentalize different topics in the same like medium.
But please don't make me go check three different places for like I know that I can reach Kathy on Slack and I can reach Kathy through I message and I can reach Kathy on discord.
But the only time I will ever use any of those other tools is if the conversation started in that outside of it and I got brought in. Because Lord knows I'm not checking that slack unless Kathy tells me I need to tell you hey, you need to get your bread over there. Yeah, exactly.
Or if it's just like I know for a fact, hey Kathy, I'm going to send you a really long AI response like I'm not sending that over I message because that's just a miserable way to look at it.
So if I'm going to do that, I'm like hold on one second, I'm going to send you something via discord that way you know.
But I guess understanding that I like that's just how I operate but other people operate differently and I mean I'm not here to say that you should always capitulate to what others need. But also say that like if you express your preferences, maybe they can capitulate to you.
So the communication about those things. Yeah, it comes down to if you don't have a preference and I also want to acknowledge and realize that part of this does have to do with the fact that like I don't have a preference.
And also that I am taking some of the emotional labor to provide the service that I need to provide to my friends slash clients slash whatever to have that separation and it might not work for you and that's okay to.
I just want to like make sure that you set limits that you need to set in order to to get it to the point where you're going to be like really happy with where you're at.
Well, Kathy, is there anything else that you want to communicate to our audience about the topic of communication? I heart you all. I think you're doing great and if you're working and if you're trying to be a better communicator, you're doing a good job.
I think that is a I know that we have some folks in our community that are job hunting that are trying to move up the ladder, you know, the career ladder. And I want to say I recognize that failing up is a thing. Trust me, there was almost a podcast called that.
It's your managers, not my manager, my manager is great. We've already talked about that, but your manager may not be the best communicator just as given again, given the nature of failing upward.
But making a concerted effort and saying the thing, like I think it's so important and that's something that I've learned from my manager is that like actively saying the word. Hey, I want to make sure that I establish a clear method of communication with you.
What is the best way to give you feedback? What is the best way to present something? And sometimes that stuff is documented, but if it's not like it's good to have that in a documented format. And I'm going to say this in some cases, like just to protect yourself in many ways.
I've definitely been in situations where someone said I wasn't told this and I was like, actually, I sent you an email. Yeah. The number of times just in last week that I had to say, hey, so this isn't what we discussed here are my notes.
And here is the email that we communicated with this that said that you were going to do this. And then you didn't just say and just say it's not my fault. Right.
And again, it's like in parts protecting yourself, but also like the better you are at doing that thing, the better that it is recognized. And I, I would, I will just flat out say I communicated early and often that my expectation at this company was to move into a position of management.
And I also let them know the consequences of not having that within a reasonable timeline and what that reasonable timeline was. And my, my boss specifically said, I know that this is a thing that you wanted because you told us.
Like you said that this was a thing that you wanted and I understand that the situation has changed a lot. But turns out we need this position field and since it's a thing that you wanted. Are you available for it? So I was like, oh, cool. The fact that I actively communicated my desires.
Then I was able to be the first person considered for that opportunity. But you have to communicate that. Yeah.
And the same comes with like interpersonal relationships, any partners that you're in, you know, making sure that, hey, if you really badly want flowers that are just, you know, if you want your partner to bring you flowers for no reason, you better tell them.
And that way you can't get mad if they never do it because guess what they can't read your mind either. Yeah, there's so many relationships that I'll talk to friends with who are like, oh, my partner didn't do anything for Valentine's Day.
It's like, okay, did you do something for them? Did you communicate more importantly? Did you communicate to them that you wanted them to do something? Now again, this is something having to do with emotional labor.
You are like, yes, it would be great if your partner did the things that made you happy by themselves. But until you have communicated properly what those things are, you're probably going to be disappointed.
Now, if it's been years and you've communicated every year for Valentine's Day, maybe suggest that they do some sort of reminder themselves so that they remember. But you can't expect them to read your mind in the same way that you can't be expected to read their mind either.
Yeah, for us things like Valentine's Day is we have like, we have small gift holidays and we have like big gift holidays. And like Valentine's Day is a small gift holiday and there's always like a let's find time for the two of us without the child to go out and read it.
So we have to go and have like some type of time that has that is positive quality. So like, hey, let's go like my wife was flying to California on Valentine's Day. So there was no big dinner or anything like that.
But we dropped, dropped the kid off at school, went and got breakfast and just went to one of a little favorite restaurant and just sat there and kind of talked and that was that was enough. So there was like this effective communication of like, hey, it's Valentine's Day.
I know that you're going to be gone for dinner. Do you want to just go grab a breakfast instead? And it's like, yeah, sure, let's do that. And like that was it. And you know, there wasn't I'm not a gift person in terms of receiving gifts. I would much rather give them.
So like when Brittany was like, hey, I don't really like we're traveling. I didn't really get you anything. I'm like, no, it's fine. I just just go dinner like that's good enough for me.
Like that open communication, that open dialogue probably saved some anxiety on her end, but also like I kind of knew what to ask for and kind of what to expect because we've had that conversation so many times.
It's not just communication, but frequent communication, even I would honestly even buck buck against like if it's been a long time, people change people change over time. I used to be like I want like a gift or whatever.
And now I'm just kind of like I don't want anything else in brought into this else. I want I want to get rid of things like less less things is great. So like I'm able to say, hey, I know I used to be big about like this kind of stuff.
But I'm kind of over it now like I still get Christmas gifts that I'm just like this was great when I was 20. Yeah. But like now like this just takes up space like I don't need this.
But I haven't communicated that with with those people because I'm like, oh, at least they thought about me, I guess. Yeah, yeah, it's interesting. And yeah, putting putting your needs to out there of like how what sort of communication you need is helpful. So yeah, try try communicating.
Well, I would like to communicate with you, Kathy and you listener about our next sponsor. This episode of condo is brought to you by P as we've already established. It's just P. A water reminder and hydration app. There are lots of apps designed to help you drink water. This one is different.
You don't have to tell it when you drink or how much you drink instead just tap a button on your Apple Watch or your phone while you're on your way to the bathroom and get reminders to drink water when it's been a long time since you peed. Interesting.
Studies show that P frequency is linked to hydration. This app gets you in tune with your body reminding you to drink water when you need it most users love the Apple Watch app where you can monitor your hydration from your watch face.
And the lock screen and home screen widgets make logging very fast. They also have a fun see where you peed feature. I don't know about that one. Isn't it privately saves your location every time you use the bathroom? Oh, okay. Well, since it's privately, that makes it better.
But you can look back at the map in a few years for a low effort visual journal of your life and travel. You can even add your family and friends to stay accountable like hey, Kathy, never mind, not even going there. And and remind each other to drink water when you both need it most.
This app was created by a solo indie developer who's on a mission to help people stay hydrated. You should check out the reviews too. P is loved by many happy users around the world. Start a healthy hydration habit today and search for P water app in the app store.
That's the letter P followed by water app in the app store. And also, please find a way to tell them that you came from conduit because I feel like this is we've done some really great like we've had some great sponsors. This one is like a ride up our alley. It's so perfect. It's accountability.
It's habit forming. It's like all those things. And also, it's just called P, which is great. That's so great. It's so great, especially since I learned that staying hydrated helps my anxiety more than even medication does. I this was an immediate download. Yeah.
So yes, please let them know that conduits and you and our things to be for their support of this show and all of relay. So Kathy, what's what you're going to be doing? Please please communicate with me what you would like to be you'd like to achieve in the next conduit.
I am going to communicate that my connection is going to be to finish cleaning my office. I don't think my monitor will be here in time by the next conduit. By the way, by the way, is going to be a guest surprise to me as well because Jay's running around the world.
So I'll be I'll be I'll be finding a guest. But I would like to finish cleaning my office. Yeah, that's that's a good one.
Kathy, audible question, would you be able to do a mini mini systems check in the post show today? Since my worry is it's going to be the next like whole period before we can actually do a systems check by the looks of it. Yeah, let's do let's do that.
Okay, this is going to be a small systems check. And if you want to hear it, you're going to have to be a super conductor. So we're waiting till the end of the year when we let AI give us a recap for systems checks. Right. Sorry, life got to life.
Maybe we'll put some notes in the show notes about what our systems are. Here's what I will commit to I will take a transcription of this part of the conversation when we have it in the after show. I will release it as a blog post and by a blog post.
I mean, I will ask AI, hey, can you fill this out for me? And then I'll double check it. And then I'll put it up on my blog. So if you go to KJ miller calm on release day as you're hearing this, there should be a blog post. And I can do that because I'll have the audio file.
So I can do that ahead of time. And the audio that I will link to it in the show notes. Yeah, yeah. So sorry, sorry for those who really like the systems checks. We just I got meetings and off sides added to my calendar. Like last minute.
As for me, my connection, I'm going to practice effective communication. And I'm going to tell someone at work. No. I don't know who that person is yet. Here's the thing is like I don't even know what the topic is.
I just know that I'm being asked a lot of things like a lot of things are being added to my plate kind of all of a sudden. And I do need to get better at saying like, hey, we just can't I can't do this at the moment.
And I'm going to use those amazing episodes in the past that we had around saying no. But I'm going to be kind of I'm going to try to do my best to communicate very clearly and effectively of like here. Here's what's my current priority.
And unless something can get moved, I don't think I'll be able to commit to something. What about our conductors? Yeah, our package cowboy Mike says started a new job as a package handler at FedEx and after being behind a desk for most of my working life. I'm now branching out into manual labor.
I hope my body survives the first day, which is this coming Monday. I also hope your body survives and take care of yourself.
Please do please, please do our checklist enthusiasts of the show Mike says reorganize remaining shelves and office and use the momentum from last conduit to refinish or to finish reorganizing the office.
