From RelayFo, you're listening to Conduit, the show we Condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Condu it, the show that lives one quarter mile at a time. This episode is brought to you by Ecam and just Ecam. No other ones.
With who you're hearing right now are the sweet sultry tones of me. I'm Jay and we will soon hear are the ever melodic calm, cool and collected, the captivating Kathy Campbell. Hello. That's the, wow. That's the heck of an entrance. That's the mood we're in today. Yes.
Is doing, doing these kinds of fun, japes. Also because we are recording live with our amazing discord friends and what happened this week in the discord? Lots of good, good conversations. So many, if you like, japes have I got a treat for you.
So many japes that happened out of the middle of nowhere.
 We had a lot of conversations about home screens, including with the beta version and the non beta version at some point, someone shared a truly cursed version that had the phone, app filling the screen and the dock, but also put in the camera there because that's the running jokes of anytime we see and judge a home screen, we definitely judge when there's the camera app in the dock.
Oh my goodness. Well, these, these photos are very strange. Also the, the Mac studio on Stilts. Yes. I'm a fan. I'm just going to say, looks like the secretary bird of Macintosh's, which is fine. I love it.
And then we had our co-working last week in the off weeks, we do a co-working session with myself and Kathy, except for this week, it was, I was not there because I was sick, but our superconductor friends, along with Kathy, worked on commissions. I had my cursor in the middle of the word scanning.
So it looked like scamming and I was like scamming and annoying projects, which I was like, ooh, that sounds like something. And ordered some coffee, ooh, coffee friends, what are coffee friends? Oh, coffee friends are. Yeah, nameless ordered coffee friends, maybe we'll get some links to share.
But I have to talk about this annoying project that I had to scan. So one of, yes, that I had to scam. One of my clients, I received their mail and scan in the mail and then rename it and file it for them.
One of my clients clients sent a binder with individual pages, like those plastic sheets of pages. So I had to pull out pages, scan them and then put them back in and that took the entire hour and it was very exhausting. Yeah, that sounds, that sounds exhausting. Yeah. I think I was laying down.
Probably. Man, I wish I could have been laying down. Well, not, I was laying down. Also last week, I was on solo parenting duty because Brittany was having a mini vacation with her grandmother.
Well, it was more of a, it was like a staycation, but her grandmother's house where she was being a caretaker for a week. Oh, yeah. So that's what you know, that is not a vacation. That is not any sort of remotely vacation. What what I will say is her grandmother is in relatively good health.
She just has some mobility issues. Like, it's far like they even came and visited us for a few hours, but her grandmother's normal caretakers had not had a vacation in some time and Brittany volunteered to stay with her grandmother for the week.
And yes, it was, it wasn't meant to be a vacation type thing, but it was supposed to be a time to get away from the normal duties of being a parent and all of the day to day stuff with my daughter and family stuff that we share. Maybe some of the stuff that she does more than I do.
And then it was, and then it gave her a different set of responsibilities and things that she said was a nice change of pace, but also for me, I was exhausted. Oh, yeah. So, so yes, no, no, no offense meant to be driven towards the, oh, you're caretaking.
That's like a vacation, not meant to be that in any way, shape or form. But Brittany was the one who mentioned she enjoyed the change of pace that she had in her day to day.
So I will give, I will next time I'm just going to have her come up here and have people talk and let her talk about it, okay? Yeah. Because I get yelled at. Sounds like a better idea. Well, yeah, you called it a vacation. It was. It's called a destination. That is not, that's not what it is.
It's a, it's a time away, but also grandma, have you taken your meds today? Like that's, that's more of a, yeah. Responsible for another human. Yes. Not a vacation. Not a vacation. Anyway, if any of this here in Kathy and Jay argue with one another, sounds fun.
You should consider becoming a superconductor. You can visit I'm a superconductor.com to become a member today. You get access to our discord. You get access to our co-working sessions in the off weeks. And you get access to the pre-show where we talked about conferences, documentaries.
Jay has a lot of hatred for these things. What else is new? And Kathy has been super busy, allowing the mini soup to live their best life. And then you also get access to the post show in which Kathy will be raiding all of the Sims emotion sounds. Ooh. I don't know what that means.
And unfortunately, we don't have clips for all of them. But I guess if you know, you know, if that sounds interesting to you, I'm a superconductor.com and become a member today. Letter I, letter M, letter A, superconductor.com. Yes. Shout outs. Kathy, we got a shout out. Yeah, we do.
So one of the things that we have enjoyed hearing during our co-working sessions is one of our superconductors, ponder's, is a writer. And has written a glorious parody that combines two things that just makes sense. One is the Fast and the Furious series.
And the other is F Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. That apparently was published on the interwebs a few months ago. Well, we just learned that it has won a Lambda Award, which is a huge prize for queer literature.
Once we get access to that link, we will definitely share that out because it's proof that good things can happen during our superconductor sessions. So now the conduit, superconductor family of friends has seen weddings, has seen award-winning literature being written. I mean, this markets itself.
Like if you want to join a community of laureates, is that a, is that the right word? Sure. Yeah, laureates, business owners, career changers, super productive, awesome people, then yes, I'm a superconductor.com. Now it's time for the connection check.
That, which we got to figure out how to do this because I'm an updated audio that the one, the only Fischekai created and sent to us that is absolutely amazing and we will be utilizing it in the future.
The death of the zapwitch, which is what I heard you say was zapwitch and I was like, what does a zapwitch taste like? Yeah, a zapwitch. Oh, a zapw, see, I was thinking WITCH, not sandwich. Well, Kathy, according to you, everything is indeed a sandwich. So that's true, but don't eat witches.
Oh, never mind. What if they're in frog form? Why are you eating frog? You know what? Hey, frog form. This is a frog form. That's not out of the ordinary. Yeah. Frog legs are a thing. Oh, yes. Alrighty. Did you get your AC installed? I did. I did.
My connection was to install the AC and I did just in time for the really, really hot weather we have going on. So that was awesome. I got both of them installed in the master bedroom and in our living room and they have been running at all times to try and keep it cool. So very, very thankful.
Yeah, we are in the midst of a heat wave and I don't like it. Not one bit. I don't like it. Not one bit, Kathy. But no, I'm glad that you got your AC.
I had guests over and they did not like, where do you, where do you keep your thermostat for your, like, what do you keep it set to? Well, not, I mean, that's hard to say because the thermostat only heats.
Oh, so what's your, what's your optimal room temperature? Like 69 and not just because it's funny. I mean, 69 to 72 is ideal. Okay. I had it set to like 70 with like, we have a fan and it's like a midroom fan and it pushes air and people came over and they were like, it's so cold.
And I was like, that's because it's a thousand degrees outside. They're like, no, but it feels like really cold. I'm like, it's 70 degrees. I don't understand. Yeah, no, they're wrong. Okay. Good. Because I was like, I've been keeping it at 75. We agree about something.
Well, I moved it to 75 because people were all like, oh, it's too cold. And I'm like, how? We're kind of, where more close? Thank you. Thank you. Yes. Yeah. All that to say, I didn't do my connection, which was to write a blog post. I did think about it.
I did look at the draft that I already have written and like, maybe change the sentence or two. But no, I did not make any dedicated effort to actually get this done. That was it felt very, very strange. Real quick, Pillix 70 degrees is 21 Celsius. Yeah.
But yeah, I genuinely, I think, have a, I wrote a different blog post. I mean, was your connection to write a specific blog post or just write a blog post? Technically, yes. Technically, yes. It was technically to write a specific blog post.
And I knew that it was a blog post that was giving me anxiety, which was why I specifically was like, I need to write that blog post. Okay.
Because the funny thing about it was when I was, when I initially said, I'm going to write a blog post as my connection check, I wrote the blog post that I was initially thinking about. But then I was like, that's honestly like, well, my employer thinks it's the most important blog post. It's not.
There was a more important blog post that needed to be written. I had anxieties around it. So then I said it to write that specific one and I did not because the anxiety is still there.
I would, I would say that when you made the connection, the blog post that you made the connection for was written. So I would argue that it would be, but even as I was quantifying with that, with that connection was going to be I specified that it was the blog post that I indeed did not write.
Yeah. I will, I will, I will take my read as a, as a period to reflect and say we can do better next time. And, and also I am getting over myself on the like everything you write has to be to the same level of famous literary award winners like ponders and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Yeah.
It's okay if you write garbage because for most people, they're not going to read it anyway. They're just going to look at the headers and go, Oh, that's nice.
I'm so glad to hear about all the amazing things that your organization is doing, which is a commentary on the world today and why I'm so upset. But it's fine. I don't have anxiety. I just have anxiety. How about our conductors? Yeah, our conductors did great. We love and appreciate them.
Debo are soprano of the show says green heart. Everything is all set for my choir party. Love that. I'm so excited. Can't wait to hear from it. Our artist of the show, Carly says red square. I spaced again. I didn't reach out to anyone to have coffee with. That's okay.
I haven't had coffee in like a week and a half, Kathy and I'm struggling. I keep meaning to make coffee and it just keeps not happening. I had an energy drink this morning so I wouldn't fall asleep on the drive back. So that was good.
Any coffee, otherwise I'm, I've been acting like I rate at work because I haven't had coffee. Oh, dear. Yeah. I'm manic without coffee.
All right, our entire advocate of the show, Gene Thess says yellow circle budget was created but still waiting for the sign off turns out the connections that rely on other people to do things automatically activates hard mode. Yeah.
Yeah, I could maybe changing the, the, like, text to be the part that you can control for the future could, could work 100%. Our robotics engineer, the show Aiden says yellow heart more progress was made but my brain has been rebelling against actually sitting down to finish the portfolio.
In the meantime though, I've revived an older electronics project I was working on. So green circle on that. I guess. Yeah. Okay. I'll take that.
I just, I just don't want to enable the thing that I did which was like not doing the thing due to anxiety but then also picking up like three other things as a distraction from the thing. Indeed.
Our identical twin of the show Aaron says connection check red circles sadly no further on London plans but did organize my notes a bit for the trip. I mean, I feel like that's yellow. You did work on it, even if it's not finished. So, but we are not going to force yellow on anybody.
And then our tech podcast, the list of the show, Pillix says red square. I have figured out that right now with the schedule I have, Swift UI is hard to keep learning. So I'll put it on the back burner and I didn't have much time. Sorry. And I didn't have much time to do fast UI.
I have applied for jobs but that's about it. I think that there is a deeper conversation there, Pillix that could be had about you probably did the most important thing of the three things that you wanted to do. You probably did the most important one.
And even though you didn't get as far in some of the other ones that you you wanted to do like at least you had to wear with all to be like, but this thing, this thing is important so I'm going to do that. Yeah. I agree. Our mountain dweller of the show, Logan. Logan.
Green check marks suit ordered. We'll probably have to get it altered some. Yay. Our checklist enthusiasts of the show Mike says red X actually set up the website and other systems for the new website. Oh, that was the previous connection. But Mike is rethinking the concept before buying hosting.
Yeah, that's smart. That didn't get to it but at least you didn't just do it for the sake of doing it to only be upset that you did it. All right. Our fish bear of the show Fishy Kai says connection check. Green circle. I want to progress on home improvement and I made progress. Excellent.
Our code, Mike, the show Douglas says green square went on a cleaning bend and got my office completely organized this week. Cassie, that was another thing that happened this week that I didn't tell you about. We got our house cleaned by a professional. Woohoo.
And it was so amazing and they even cleaned around the mess that is my office and the office is a mess, but it's a clean mess. And I'm very, I've got to get back. That might be my connection for this week because they're going to come to the house twice a month now to do to clean. And that's. Yeah.
Oh, my goodness. I'm so excited for you all. So excited. And our final connection for the day, nameless of the show, nameless says green circle had a great morning with my brother with some good coffee. That's amazing. Yay. Coffee. This episode of Condo it is brought to you by ecam.

And I'm not the biggest fan of the big project. So I had an initial question for you. When it comes to doing big things, do you like to just do it all at once or do you like to do it slowly and methodically over time? And I don't think that there's a wrong answer here.
I'm just interested in what your preference is. Yeah, I think it depends on the thing. If it is physical based, I kind of need to do it all in one so that I will get it done because otherwise, if I take a break, I lose momentum and then don't want to do it anymore.
But when it comes to like brain work or planning and those types of projects, I have an easier time of doing methodical and working through things little at a time, especially something that is like a gigantic project.
It's a little bit easier for me to be like, okay, I'm just going to go to this point, x. And then I will take a break, work on something else, do something different, let my brain kind of process through what's going on, and then come back and do part y, and then it works out. I like that.
I'd like to tell myself I am a, you know, do the little steps, the baby steps type person when I'm not, I know that I'm not, what am I, what am I kidding?
I definitely feel, and I guess the context here is, so I don't know about other places in the world, but America has this thing called, okay, that some communities in America will have called an HOA.
I don't even know what HOA stands for. Home owners association. Oh, yeah, it is home owners association. You are correct. That is your smart. I don't have one, but I know. And that is the big, that's the big catch for people. Some people, most people hate having an HOA.
And I think that like, for me, HOAs are like a necessary evil for people who, let's be honest, would probably not keep up with it if they were not afraid of being fined. Hi, I'm one of those people.
I will do the minimum of like, oh, hey, if the yard's getting a little unruly, we'll have someone come out and do yard work, or if I absolutely have to, I will do the yard work. But ultimately, it's a lot easier to justify doing it if I go, oh, if I don't keep up with it, then I will be fined.
And what we have, kind of the big thing that gave HOAs kind of a bad name is, usually you have to pay dues for your HOA to operate. So, which means you're paying for someone to basically criticize how you live, or at least the outward appearance of how you live.
And then occasionally, they will get a little out of control with the rules. Like we have a very simple rule, which just says you can't have more than four cars on the street. And a lot of that is just people block driveways and things like that. It takes up space.
So they just have a simple rule that's like, hey, no more than four cars in a driveway, or like in a like outside of your house. Yeah. Well, not even in your household, just overnight.
So like if you have guests over, you can't have more than four vehicles blocking like parts of the road, which to me sounds reasonable. If they're there for a little while, like you're throwing a party or something, no one's going to complain, we live on a call to sack.
So there's plenty of parking if it's during the day. But like if three or four days have gone by and the cars have not moved, that is a problem.
And we also do have long enough driveways that most, that, you know, any reasonable amount of guests that you would have for an extended period of time could just park in your driveway.
So again, like there are a lot of these things like their rules because if they're not rules, someone will do them. But also some people are very much like you're paying sometimes thousands of dollars for people to tell you what you can and can't do with your own house, which you own.
Our HOA is very, very friendly. We pay like $200 a year for HOA, which is not bad at all. And what does that money do? So that money pays for landscaping in the primary area. It also does pay the officers a very small stipend.
And I mean, like I think it's like not even $1,000 for like the five officers. Like they might get like $150 for, hey, you, you ran two meetings and you made sure that all of the agreements and stuff that took place happened.
And some of those agreements are actually good for us because like we have, where we live, we don't have city trash collection because we live technically outside of the city limit. Although you couldn't tell, there's a mall literally two street lights from us.
But because of where we are zoned, we have to pay for private trash collection. But they actually gave us a deal that is better than what we could get on our own because it was, it was organized through the HOA.
So yeah, again, there's an argument of like, what am I paying for? But like I feel like $200 a year is very, very friendly considering some HOAs pay for like monthly stuff, which is, we see people, people in the chat that are like, I will never.
And again, one of the things that they are very adamant about is like, whatever you do to the backside of your house, they do not care. Like if you want to build a deck, you can build a deck.
If you have a fence or if you don't have a fence, that's up to you as long as you, if you have a fence, you keep up with it. Here is my problem with HOAs. The stuff that you are saying how it is now is just how it is now. But people are the worst.
 And there's comes a time where 10 years from now, that rule of no more than four cars overnight becomes no more than two cars overnight, which then becomes no household can have more than two cars because of whoever buys a house or say someone buys a house and it becomes rented out for college students.
Okay. Well, they can only afford if they have five people living there. Okay. So now they can't all have cars in that house that they're living in. This is the only way they can afford to have a place to stay.
And they're not allowed to put their cars on the street without getting fined or without getting yelled at or without whatever things are restricted. My brother's HOA. So my brother is disabled, retired Marine. Yes, don't come. Don't please don't email me saying that Marines never retire.
They just fade away or whatever. I get that. No, it's a thing. And we're like, Kathy, as a Marine who is no longer active duty or a reservist, I understand. Yeah, I know. But like I, I'm just, I'm just prefacing it so that nobody, and Marines do retire.
Like that, like they served their 20 years and retire or they were discharged for reasons outside of their control. Yeah. Like you can, you can be a retired Marine and still be a Marine.
If you say former Marine, that's the thing that people are like, oh, once a Marine always a Marine, like there's no more. Yeah, yeah, I try. I, yeah, it doesn't matter. You're good on the verb is if anybody wants to come talk about it, they can come, they can yell at me.
Who is a Marine? We're accepting it. Yeah. Yeah. Go after Jay. Yeah. Anyways, so there's some physical concerns that he has. And as such, he was like, instead of mowing my lawn, which is dumb, like this is a whole conversation about lawns, like let's get started.
He petitioned to the HOA to allow for something that looks nice that's not grass. So he didn't have to mow it. Like a zero escaping setup. Yeah. There's so many options and he didn't have a specific, it's not like he went and said, hey, this is what I want to do.
He said, here are 10 options that would allow me to live more successfully and more beneficially in my house, that I own that I purchased. Yeah. And they said no. I, I 100% understand and this was a, our old house did not have an HOA. And that was intentional.
And I am not here, I am not here to be like pro HOA. I'm very pro my HOA at the moment because of the fact that we knew we had some burn spots in our yard. And you know, we're in a drought right now. So there's, there is this moment of like, hey, we have a very large shade tree.
We have two shade trees in our front yard. It's blocking off a lot of the natural light, but it's also restricting a lot of the water that would get to the grass that's underneath it. So because of that, we are dealing with burn spots around our grass.
And basically they were like, hey, you got to get this resolved and you got to get it resolved by the end of the month. It's like, you don't have to have it completely fixed because that's not how grass works.
We would have to like rip out all the grass and so new grass in it would just look like we ripped out new grass. You know, we're doing, we're doing more harm than good at that point. But what it gave me was like a, here is a big project that I have been putting off.
And I now have a deadline as to when I need to get that process started. And when I need to file for an extension because again, that's not how grass works. So it's been nice to, it's been annoying. I'm not going to lie. It's been annoying because we don't have our sprinkler system doesn't work.
And we don't know why which makes, which makes me afraid to use the sprinkler system. Because that just makes me feel like there's like a crack somewhere and like a leak. And I don't want to just be like dumping water into like an area.
I have like one really nice lush patch and then everything else is still dead. So like I literally have like a garden hose with like a multi area like sprinkler attached to it. The thing that like moves back and forth does that whole thing.
And I just move it to the different areas and it takes like an hour of my time. And I do that twice a day now. But I'm doing that in like, you know what? I would have never done this had I not had someone force me to do it.
As big of a project as it is, I know that it's not all like there are other pieces that we're going to do. Like we were told, hey, you can use pine straw to like parts that are going to be problematic. Just cover it in pine straw. It's fine. Like it'll it'll make it look nice and you'll be fine.
So like there's a part of me that is like, I'm so glad that I have this big project that I am doing that takes me two hours a day every day for the next couple of weeks. But also I love that overall it is an ongoing process.
And I think that's where I like the little tasks is if it's like a big thing, let me just take some time and do the big thing and it's annoying. But if it's an ongoing process process, if it's a big, very multi tiered thing, let me focus on doing big chunks of it at once.
Maybe not like a bunch of small chunks because I'll never do all of the small chunks. But if I can do like big chunks, then okay. What it worked for you if you had the small chunks joined together to be bigger chunks. I don't like one big one big small chunk. Yeah. Well, think so.
And again, like it's go move the sprinkler and then in 30 minutes go move the sprinkler again. And in 30 minutes go move the sprinkler again. And then after that turn the sprinkler off. I can handle that.
If it was, I mean, a good example of this is when I water my plants, I water them all at the same time. Well, I water all the ones that need to be watered at the same time.
But the way that I do it is I use the water bottle technique where I like poke a hole in a water bottle and I make a little hole in the soil and I just stick the water bottle in the soil. And I will use the same water bottle and use tap water.
I know don't you know save the environment, all those things. But like I will do that and then I will walk away because I know that when I'm done, the water bottle will be empty. The soil will be nice and soft and full of water and all those things.
And any excess water will have drained out and gone into our flower bed in the front yard utilizing it even more. So like there's there's this but I do like both of them at the same time. It's like boom, boom, I'm going to go away. And then I come back later that day and it's like, oh, I'm done.
Boom, taking back upstairs, put it back up in my window. And that has kept me up on being able to do this because it is, it is a thing that doesn't take a lot of time.
But let's be honest, if I didn't have, if I didn't make it bigger, if it was just like do that with one and then do that with the other and then do that with the third one, like all at different times, I wouldn't do it. Like I have to make those little tasks bigger.
So I guess in a way like yes, but I think it has to be the same task. I don't think it can be like do this little thing. I'll do another little thing as a part of the thing. It has to be like do the same thing. Just do it for multiple things at one time. Interesting.
 But I wanted to talk this out because I'm trying to figure out other areas in my life in which I'm either doing that or in which I could do that because I think that like the big one that people get is like dishes because I don't want to have to do a ton of dishes because that means my house probably smells or has like dirty dishes in it all the time.
That's kind of one of those, I'm okay with just doing that little task every time I see it.
And I feel like it's wasteful, but I have started becoming the person that's just like if there are one or two dishes in the sink, I will just do the dishes and then set them down and like be like, okay, now there's no more dishes in the sink. I feel like that's wasting water in some ways. Yeah.
Because otherwise I see that big, that big like stack of dishes and I'm like, I don't want to do that right now. Yeah, and that's hard, but that's how my child does it. Dishes are their chore.
And there are times where I'm good and let them just do it when they feel like it and then there's a lot of other times where that's not. And I have to tell them and kind of push them and be like, hey, it's time. It's time to do the dishes. The moment of dishening has come. Indeed, indeed.
I think that is interesting in how some folks are like, this is like a house thing. We do our, I'm very much, I will do laundry whenever I feel like I need to do laundry. But then Brittany will have a scheduled time of doing laundry.
Like I do laundry Sunday night at this time and Tuesday night or whatever the other nights are at this time in which we grab all the laundry and do all the laundry, which I'm just like, I want my favorite shirt to wear. My favorite shirt is dirty.
I need to wash my, I need to do my laundry so that I can wear my favorite shirt again. Yeah. Again, what I'm saying is I am a wasteful human being. Well, everyone else is doing things with some intentionality. I'm doing it with intentionality, but also with waste.
Listen, it's nothing compared to the waste of all of the companies that do their wasteful things. So it makes sense. Yeah, big companies. You should do your laundry once a week. Yeah.
Oh, but yeah, are there, are there instances, Kathy, for you that you can think of that are just like, maybe this would be easier if I took the small things and bundled them into the big thing or if I took the big thing and broke it down?
I'm trying to think because, well, so, okay, I need, I need to clean my office.
My office, it just, there's stuff from my multiple trips that I've done that I still haven't unpacked. I have a bunch of boxes that I have to break down to recycle. There's a bunch of these things and my brain is such that I'm like, I need to do it all at once.
When technically I could, in fact, just say, hey, just get rid of the recycling. And that's one step that's done. I don't know why my brain says otherwise.
I feel like cleaning is so hard to do though, especially if it's in a space that you're living in because like, I'm just going to empty the recycling. Okay, you empty the recycling. And then by the time you go to do the next thing, the recycling is full again. Yeah. Yeah. But unfortunately. Yeah.
I will say having someone come into my house made me clean a lot, which was ridiculous because they were coming to clean. No, I get it. The problem is is that I have had my girl here so often that it now, I just apologize for the disaster. And you're like, it's a mess. I know.
It goes about her day. It's still, it's still new to me. So I'm very much like, I can't have, I can't have people thinking I live in. I live in a pigsty. Yeah. I don't have that problem. Well, I would, I would love to hear from some of the art conductors as well.
How, what are some of the tasks that you love doing that are big tasks?
I think that that's the other piece of it is that the, the get up and move the sprinkler and then like not do anything for 45 minutes while I'm waiting for the, for the sprinkler alarm to go off so that I can go move the sprinkler again.
It's kind of nice because it gives me an excuse to not do anything like, I mean, like, I can watch a baseball game or something and be like, oh, okay, at the next commercial, I'm going to go move the sprinkler because the alarm went off.
But then I can't be like, hey, let's all get together and play a board game and stuff because it's like, no, because I'm on sprinkler duty right now. Also the fact because you definitely couldn't stop in the middle of the board meeting to, or board meeting. The board meeting.
Yeah, the definitely can't stop in the middle of a board meeting. Got a, well, it feels weird when you do and sometimes stuff, you get sprayed with water and then you're like, and so then like you actually dress down.
And it's also, it's like, it's quiet because it's so hot outside that I do it at night. So it's like, well, also, I will do it right after I have a meeting after our call, but then after that call, I'll do it in the middle of the day. And that's miserable. Don't get me wrong. That sucks.
But yeah, that sounds terrible. At night, it's not unbearable. It's like super dark outside. Occasionally, there will be a giant spider, which is terrifying. Oh, yeah, exactly. I saw that thing yesterday and I was like, I don't like it.
But I, there's something nice about being outside when it's super quiet. You have the crickets and the frogs and we don't have street lights, you know, so it's dark and like peaceful. That's nice. And it forces me to slow down, which is also nice. And also something that I wouldn't do on my own.
So for that, I'm grateful. Yeah. And also I noted no to big spiders. Yeah. No, no to any spiders, really. I don't mind the little ones. The little ones are like, hey, they're a little fella. You're annoying. I'm going to need you to go away or you're going to have to. Nope.
You're going to have to meet a shoe. And I don't want you to meet a shoe, especially if you're outside because that's your territory. I mean, your house. Yeah, they can, they can be outside. Like whatever you want. They outside, whatever you want to do. Like that's fine.
But I don't want you where I live. Yeah. K-thanks, bye. All right. Well, speaking of K-thanks and bye, folks, let us know what you're doing, what you bundle together to do as big projects and then what you do as some little ones. Leave us that feedback using the link in the show notes.
Or if you're a superconductor, then I don't know, put it in the livestream chat with the or show follow up. There you go. Show follow up with the conduit emoji. That's how we do things here. I forgot.
Speaking of forgetting, Kathy, what are you going to do this week? I am going to get rid of the recycling in my office. Yay. I like it. That's an easy connection. You're like, that's it. Yep. Listen, I got to have a low bar. That's the tough thing is I feel like I need a. I need a small win.
I'm going to order the pop up banner for the event in Ohio that I'm supporting because that's happening. I think that happens like the week in between the next conduit or that happens the week after the next conduit. So that's kind of got to get done. Otherwise it won't arrive in time. Yeah.
Good call. So yeah, that's that's the thing that I got to do. And I got to do all the steps to which includes also requesting my reimbursement so that I can get that money back. Yeah. Awesome. And actually, oh, no, there's more to that task. Okay.
I will send my conference in a bag bag and I will order the banner for the event. I think that's everything that I have to do for those things. Writing that down. Excellent. I will. Make sure to write it down in the show notes. Yes. So we can help you pace it too. Doing.
I just saw your little face pop up doing that right now. What about our conductors? Yeah, we have a first time connection check from Carl, who is our Jack of all trades of the show. They will contact the arts and crafts.
That's the name of a venue about hosting a creative art with code workshop events with a grand idea of turning it into a reoccurring event. So Carl showed up in hashtag break room and talked about this event. So arts and crafts, crafts as in craft beer.
They do so many cool things that I want to go to it very, very badly because it sounds absolutely incredible. And so I cannot wait to hear how creative art with code the workshop goes. Now I want creative craft beer with code. I mean, I can't even drink it.
Oh, maybe I can do creative sideers with code or something like that. Jack that sounds art, Carl. I almost want to call yourself the Carl of all trades. Does to make it easier because I'm going to call you Jack every time I see it now. But Carl, that sounds fantastic.
