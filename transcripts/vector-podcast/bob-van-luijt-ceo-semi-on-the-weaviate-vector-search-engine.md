6 someone write good from players friends to That's a vector database and I'm sure Bob will talk more about it what it is what it isn't. Hey Bob. Hey, do you think for having me cool to be here? Yeah, thanks for joining.
I know you have a haptic schedule, but it's always nice to pause a little bit and talk about things. And I was thinking maybe we can start off by introductions like if you can introduce yourself your background and kind of like how did you end up working for this product and company? Yeah, sure.
So I started my career as a software engineer and later I moved to a more IT and software consultancy and one of the things that I was working with a lot of unstructured data and we're probably going to talk way more about that.
 But the story that I have is that the years ago I was at a conference in San Francisco and it was a cloud conference and back then it was just announced that there was a change in the Google search algorithm and you have to bear my thesis, this predating like you see in the remote like transformers and those kind of things.
This was the time that I think the glass was the biggest thing around. And they made it change and they said well we're going to go more to contextual search. We're going to go on the way from what they call then page rank to rank brain.
And one of the things that I was looking into is like is there any company or are these cloud providers are they going to provide database technology or search engine technology that actually deals with a similar type of search so that it becomes easier to search through unstructured data.
And the answer was actually like they weren't looking into it or maybe they weren't sharing it. So I was actually at the airport of San Francisco and I just started to work on this idea. And it was like it's coming from a lot of directions back then.
So it was a lot happening, knowledge graphs were happening and the machine learning was growing. And at some point I thought like hey actually I do think that there's an opportunity in the market for this. And so I started to work on this. I started to gather a team around me.
And what then happened was that a lot happened in the machine learning space. So think about these transformers models were released. They were getting better and better.
 And back then we were still looking at like having like these factory presentations said that we can talk a little bit more about in a bit like on the site but we actually don't like hey actually if we use this we can just solve new use cases and we can build a completely new database or new search engine.
And so that is the origin story. So that's where I'm coming from and why we started because unstructured data was a problem. It is still a problem.
And I strongly believe that these kinds of vector search technologies are helping in solving these problems not only in text but also basically anything you can vectorize. So they can be images that can be audio but that could also be I don't know the human genome you name it.
All these things can be vectorized and it gives another perspective to search through the data. So that's the origin story. That's awesome. That's awesome to hear. And like you know like this field is still in many ways emerging right.
Like the field of let's say vector databases per se as products but also the field of applying them you know for different use cases.
But you know like it's interesting you touched on like you you know you knew about you know Google kind of disclosing something and then you knew that the models have been also developing right.
Let's say basically you predated that but then bird came out right and then in other fields you know let's say computer vision automatic speech recognition they also been vectorizing in some way maybe signal processing wasn't vectorizing but then I guess they started doing it.
 And like it's interesting do you think that you kind of like coincided like you basically predicted this field right like you didn't know it will happen you felt that it will happen but it wasn't at the same scale as it is now today we have so many models right like I don't know hugging face making a product out of it and so on.
But like do you think there was a real need or was it kind of coinciding that yes now there are models we are addressing the similar problems you know but using different technique and now you are there with your idea.
 Yeah so I mean there are two sides of the going to answer this question so I want to end that's more the about the need and then secondly about when I knew when I sold the value and so let me let me start with the first thing so on structure data is huge and the problem that we currently have with search is that if you know what you're looking for you can find it if you don't know what you're looking for you can't so to make that very simple if you have a webshop for example just sort of a grocery store or something like that and you're looking for medicine because you have a headache then you must somehow or use the name of the product or somebody needs to tag the product to find it right so if you have like I don't know a aspirin then somebody has to add the keyword you know and headache or something like that or painkiller and then even with painkiller you know etc.
 What these models solve and then we already talk about the NLP and the natural language pressing models is the is that they solve is that you can look in the vicinity of these words and what I often give is an example to think about it just as a as a mental model is a is an actual physical grocery store so the example that I always gave is that I say like well let's say that I like a I have a shopping list and a shopping list says like Apple banana washing powder if you would have a traditional data if you would have a store that it's organized as a traditional database then it could be for example on an alphabetical order it's going to be pretty difficult to actually find what you're looking for because maybe at the A you might not find the Apple but you have to look to the G because you're looking for a granny Smith app etc.
 And what these these factor models do is that they they're basically a form of like a hyperspace right so they have you can envision them as as a as a tree dimensional space so if you walk to the food department right in the in the grocery store and you find an apple then you know that a banana will be closer by than the washing powder is and if you move towards the washing powder you move away from these from the from the from the food section and that brings me to the second part of my answer when I knew that is this potential was because I made this very simple super super super simple a prototype which was based back then on on glove and the big problem was that people say like there's a problem with disambiguation so if I have a word with the fact to re-presentation for example or Apple is that related to the fruit apple or to the company apple so I did something very simple I said like well if I have a document or a sentence and again at bear in mind this is predating transformers and I said well what if I take these individual works so I wrote a very simple script that took these individual words I said I'm going to calculate a new factor representation just a centroid based on these works so now I said okay I have a company with an apple so I take all these individual words calculate centroid and now I see if I can somehow make the work you know the sentence less ambiguous and that turned actually out to work rather well not extremely well but rather well again we're talking years back now and then I knew okay this here is value because I could think of so many things that you now can index and you can search in the air quotes vicinity of it in your in your vector space it made it easier to find things it made it easier to classify things etc etc so that's that would basically be my answer how I see that yeah so it's it's a great answer so it's like the the way I thought about it's like you bring context to your data right if we stay on the text side for the moment you said apple and banana you know they are related because they are both fruit right but there could be some other related items now data set we just don't know about as long as we encoded them and with the right kind of distance metric we can figure it out how close they are so it sounds like coming back to your previous example where we have used let's say inverted index you know we would just store all our items in some alphabetic order and hope for the best and that order I think inherently didn't have the context right so the context was kind of in it was kind of represented in a different way like in it specifically in the in the case of inverted index you deal with a dictionary of terms pointing to a posting list right speaking in lip scene search engine bingo for the moment here so and that posting list is just an order order list of document IDs so you don't have much context there either right no exactly and that is that is how it how it brings context and and and and again going back to that to that mental model or that the idea that you can have about it is that what I what I said I so if you take the the the the building where the where you have to grow history in the building the building would be the database basically and the model tells you where to put stuff in that building so that's how it's giving that that context and then the only thing that we need to do well I make it sound very simple now but the thing that we need to do in that database is make it possible as easy as possible for the end user to navigate through that building and that is basically what the vector database is doing so it's taking the data and we can also talk a little bit more about the features that that we have in wv8 because that's also something that we we don't only store factors we also store data objects but basically if you bring a data object to wv8 you tell it and take this part of that information to vectorize so for example if you have well product for example then you could say well I want to factorize the title and description that is factorized and then it the model tells wv8 where in that database or in that vector space to place that data object and that is what we try to optimize for as much as we can so that you can search through to hundreds of millions of data objects in using that model in just mere milliseconds yeah that's fantastic and I think before we move to the like kind of what you are focusing on as a product which is super exciting and I mean you're doing a ton of work I just wanted to close off on that on that line of thought that maybe just maybe we are on the verge of closing the inverted index data structure because it existed since I think 15th century like the first book where they published the index page in the end it's an inverted index because it said okay this word occurs on this page that's an inverted index right and so it existed for multiple centuries and so you think we are on the verge of replacing it with contextualized embeddings I mean that is certainly that isn't that isn't an exciting thought I have to know that there are a few things from a from a from a technical perspective where the inverted index is still being used but one of the things that we've done for example wv8 is that we said like we double down on the factor you know on the on the on the contextual search and yes every now and then so for example if you say they show me if you have a product database and you say like show me products to for outdoor sporting for example but they have to be more expensive than 10 bucks then you know both types of indexes kick in but it definitely starts from the perspective of vector search and I like your idea so the amount of also research has been released that we of course also benefit from is is amazing so I like that talk I like that idea yeah so I think on the next lecture I also a little bit like teach students in the local university here and when I explained some basic building blocks of sort of you know classical search engine architecture and I explained the inverted index then I ask I puzzle them with this question do you know how old this data structure is and the students are actually from the linguistic department so they they're not as kind of you know IT people who care only about code they also care about the rest of the life in many ways so there's no I think no I don't want to play the IT guys but I'm just saying they are kind of very multi-dimensional you know and they and they're just puzzled and they say okay maybe 18th century they don't know but then I just bring the screenshot of a really old book which is in the 18th century and they're like really so I just I sort of make that connection that hey we are still using the tech that was invented in 15th century yeah yeah yeah nobody that's I mean I agree with you and that is that is extremely exciting and I think we'll also get into that but but you also see emerging is like these the use cases where those kinds of database and search engines are do that are kind of solved I mean of course it's so fair so it can always be better and always be more but those kind are kind of solved but what we see actually with these fact search engines is that new use cases and new options actually pop up so we can do new things with it so and I think that's very exciting as well yeah absolutely that's an exciting way to kind of approach this new emerging field is to look for use cases and I was really wondering like what is that that you are building in the company your BIV8 database engine so you said that you have an you had an idea you know you started assembling the team now you give vision you drive a lot of things on the open source you're super active what is it that you are focusing on you know for your users and maybe you can also go into use cases part sure so it's important to bear in mind that if you look at a solution like we've said you can take two angles to look at it so you can as I like to go you can look at it bottom self so that's really true the core technology that's how you can look at but you can also look top down and so that is from the from the use case perspective and they're like that are people in working on BIV8 and as you mentioned it's also it's open source that are working and talking about like this from the bottom self approach and I like to take a little bit more it's top down so just like so what are the things that we can do with it and and so let me explain to you what so what we're building so at the at the core so you can see that's like a they're like three layers basically so the first layer is the database itself so you can find that database on on on GitHub you can find it on the documentation or website and it's just called the BIV8 factor search and it's the core database we see people use the database just to store data objects and their own factory presentations now what is very important to know from a use case perspective and I'm now starting at the lowest level is that we thought that it was very important from the get go to make sure that people can not only store the factors but also the data that they are representing so add back to to to in example of the product but it will be an article or what have you you can actually store the product so the price the name the description and those kind of things and you can say this product has this factor representation and on top of that we also said like we want to be able to connect these data objects together in a more air quotes traditional graph format just to make sure so we just not a graph database but it has a graph data model now when we go into use case I can I will share a few cool things that I that you can do with that but that's so that is at the core at the heart that is the database and what does that database focus on it's focus on being a database so that you can have create right update and delete functionality which is an easier set than done and there's a lot of content also that my my colleague agenda talks about online if you really want to get into the nitty gritty so but it's dead there's a database that you're used to you use BIV8 in a similar fashion so you take the container to spin it up APIs become available or the rest of the APIs of the graph channel APIs client available Python Go Java what have you that you can connect to the database so if you're used to working with a database or a search engine it's the same functionality there that is one that sits at the core then around that we have our first layer or a second layer and that are those are modules and what these modules do they do a few things so we've seen like hey there are actually certain types of for example machinery models that people keep using over and over to get these vector representations why not bundle them so think about the text to veck models that we have so we have different types for different use cases where you can say well I'm going to throw in that product but automatically take a model to create a vector representation for that so that's something that we have reveals have question answering models spell check models you can create your own models sorry I'm saying models I meant modules sorry this is a little bit and it's so models and modules so I meant modules and those are available open source as well and my colleague Laura made a great video also on like how you can build your own modules and then we have like a another layer around that and then we go a little bit outside of the realm of the software per se itself and those are more in the the package use cases that we see so we see that there's a lot of value in in retail wholesale e-commerce in the medical space data management space those kind of spaces and what we're doing and that's most also my focus is okay okay if we have at the core we have this one singular database what are these package things that we can do around it and that is also where we make a distinction between our users and our customers so our customers are mostly interested in these packages right it can say okay I have a PRP classification problem oh great you can actually do that with V8 with that specifically for companies in your industry can also be for for documents search for a medical use case image use cases image similarities and so we package them together so that would be the last there sometimes there are software involved for example in in the form of plugins and those kind of things but that is the that is the outer layer so that is what we've had looks like and that's what you're constantly building because as you mentioned before um the effector is kind of a new thing right to actually deal with that and but a question might be it's like so what's the so what's actually the new thing right so the other day somebody asked me said like well it was a data scientist it's like well but if I have my factors I can just store them like in my memory and and do some similarities or something and said yes you can absolutely do that I said like now but what if you want to do that for a a product catalog that might have like 50k products that are constantly changing and those kind of so then that becomes problematic so we actually help you to bring these models to production and what you actually see is that the new use cases that come out of that are tremendously big and we're just constantly uncovering new ones so let me give you one example so the let's stay with the ecommerce example so if I have and we've had a data object that has a product and a product has effective representation that it got from a for example transform a model then we can also say and we get well I have a cart I just a shopping cart now if people add products to the shopping cart we can real time calculate new vector representations based on what people have in these carts so now we can say hey based on what you have in your carts you might be interested in this or that product as well so now you have these real time now all of a sudden it it changed from a search engine where you can find products into a recommendation engine for ecommerce just all in one and those kind of things for constantly uncovering and there's so much more that we that we can do from from very concrete things like ecommerce to on all the other ends of the spectrum things like with effects representation that people are calculating for like a genomes and those kind of things so that is just that keeps just the use case keep turning up you know almost on a daily basis yeah yeah that's I I want to that's so great like dive in I was kind of a little bit I wanted to unpack a little bit like things so I understand them well enough and maybe our listeners will too as well so you know like when you said models and modules you know let's say I'm a researcher I have a model embedding model right that I've been using and the battle testing now if I want to introduce that model into VIAVI8 I will have to create a module which is using this model is that right is that okay that's correct yeah and and and I need to extend some API right that you provide yes and that is something that we spent a lot of time on and that's the API design because the IMA strong believer in developer UX so it needs to be as clean and as easy as possible so one of the things for example that we've done is that we've adopted GraphQL as an interface and so sometimes people ask is it like well why GraphQL and not something more expressive like Spark or something like that which is a good question or one of the things that we know is like well if we focus on being an effective database and we just want to show these data objects with effect representation and you know sometimes it's possible have these as the graph relations connections in them but we're not focusing on being a graph database we think actually GraphQL does a job and it's easy for people to understand it's very intuitive for people to understand and I think that these kind of things are very important and so to get back to your to your point that to your question so what we try to do is make it as easy as possible to actually bring these if you have your own models to production and it's like well I don't have any models but I just want to do you know a semantics search through I don't know a resumes right then you know just pick something off the shelf shoot it in 3D API and you could do that so let's say and also this is kind of like which I think is very important in today's world even though a lot of machine learning and data science happens in Python you know when you go let's say to web scale sometimes you cannot use Python anymore like you need to use let's say go right or maybe see bindings in go and things like that so your API is it kind of cross-lingual meaning I have my model in Python or maybe in go can I kind of plug it in or do I need to rewrite some layer on top of it to be compiled yes that is a great question and here comes the especially the expertise of the development team in so the what they have done is that is like well we know that that that that that center right that database that just needs to be optimized as far as possible because I'm you know let's stick with the e-commerce example if you use it in production and hundreds of people are searching and you want to give these recommendations you need to be able to scale it so you need to choose a language and an architecture that actually supports that so in our case that's let's go but even if you if you look to the to the GitHub repository you will even find the assembly optimizations for certain things in there but we also knew that we said like well maybe if you want to use model that's written in for example that has bindings in Python for example or you like to work in in Python so one of the things that we did there so it's like well the way that the modules work is that the modules are containerized so there are APIs going between Weaviate and the different modules and as long as you adhere to these APIs you can choose with any whatever language you want to build to build a module so in the case of Weaviate Weaviate itself is completely written in go and as like even with the assembly optimizations those kind of things and the modules we have a few modules that are for example written in Python because we use specific types of transformer modules that just you know run well within Python so you can do whatever you want within it when it comes to using Weaviate so you have the database running and you can pick a client for example the Python client and have the Python client interact with Weaviate wherever it sits but if you're building a frontend application people use for example the JavaScript clients we have I've seen people build react applications with the JavaScript clients so that's that's why we structure it like that that it's easy to use in production yeah that's amazing and and you know like what you touched on it's so important and I mean close to my heart as well I've been building APIs kind of in my free time for a long time and you know like what I've noticed with the users is that the lower you put the boundary to kind of enter right like meaning let's say you have an API and you have published the sample clients to use this API on all possible languages let's say kind of the mainstream ones at least you know it will lower the thresholds to enter for them so they will never even contact you they will start using it right that's that's the win that's the win right yeah and I even believe the so to so to sidestep a little bit from the discussion but it's my it's interesting to talk about this because the I am a strong believer and I'm I'm I'm touting my horn for like years already about this that is it like the overlap between the tech and the business science is in my opinion expressed in the API layer so if you peel the onion of a tech business you can go as deep as go unless you have a graphical user interface but if you talk about database technology those kind of things even bigger platforms if you look at the API the API describes to you in human language what is what what it's exposing and therefore what the value is that it's creating and the only thing that you need to do is business is it's right to capture that value yeah exactly and it's like I think the the the sort of the saying behind the API platform I was using back then they were saying like software is eating the world but APIs are eating software so they like decomposing the software that was sitting on the shelf somewhere in those big companies small companies whatever and now it it's introducing the network right so like everyone wants to expose their value through an API and you can easily consume that value through an API right and then you add all this you know payment you know layers and whatnot to actually make it economically feasible but that's that's I think that's an exciting direction and I'm happy to hear that you guys are pursuing that model like basically making it an API in many ways database should be an API right it's sitting somewhere and I can connect to it with my client of you know in the language of my choice and you know handle all the cases I need to handle exactly and I think so if you look at a nice car for example right there are two ways that you can look at the car so the bottom up way if you compare it's software right the bottom up way is that the first thing that you do you open the hood and you you you know you look at the beauty of the engine and maybe you want to know how the engine works on the hood the top down by your looking at it is just opening the door sitting in the chair holding the interface of the car the steering wheel and you go like oh this this car drives you know it drives fantastic it drives amazing amazing and my argument persians and I and not everybody agrees but that's my point of view is that I said like if you have an amazing engine but you know shitty steering wheel nobody's gonna drive your car I mean the other way around social truth that if you have a beautiful interface in your car and you have a shitty engine that also doesn't work but that needs to play well together and that's again why I'm a strong believer in that in that in the in the UX the experience that you have in using the technology because of course an experience is not limited to a graphical use in space that can also sit in a in an API of course yeah absolutely and you know like coming back to some of the use cases you brought up I mean you you mentioned the shopping cart I was actually chatting to Eric Pugh hey Eric if you're listening to this from open source connections you know he was saying like out of his you know it's kind of out of blue sky he was saying hey so let's imagine a use case it's a pizza delivery and and you want to encode the journey you know of your delivery person with no left turns right so like only right most or like all right turns or you know forward backward but no left turns just for whatever reason and this was like a very interesting use case like can I actually express that in the form of embedding probably I do I can right so and and do some kind of geographical search and like say okay what's the most similar sort of journey that will bring these pizza from A to B sounds a little bit crazy but you know like that's what I'm thinking when a use case exists the the sort of the journey is to go backward from it to to the embedding space right and that's that's very interesting yeah yeah but so so let's build a little bit further on the so I I like the example right so so but let's let it's an it's an it's a good example but it's an an abstract example so we might even make it a little bit more concrete right so let's say you have a pizza delivery surface and from the moment somebody orders the pizza you have certain data right so you have data about like what's on the pizza it's coming from or the person living etc etc there are two things that you can do right you can and go that information in the vector representation and if you are fast enough in comparing vectors with old orders you can say something about that order and that it becomes interesting so what you now can do is you can say for example you might be able to say something about delivery times so you can say okay I've we've sold that say that you're like a big pizza chain you know we'll sold like a million pizzas in the past now based on this request we real-time calculate the vector representation for this order we do a real-time comparison for orders in the past and I said hey we see that the average of the loss I don't know 10 orders that are similar was like 18 minutes so now real-time you can say something about that so this is just an example of a use case that where these vector databases might be extremely valuable and that's just a example and that just more and more of these kinds of cases are popping up so that's that's extremely exciting in my opinion yeah I mean it it sounds so interesting because like you know there are so many products that still revolve around the idea of let's say kind of for simplistic terms inverted index like I'm using that 15th century model to represent my data right then if I have images I'm like oops what should I do now okay maybe I can use some extension on top of Lucine if I'm using Lucine let's say for the sake of it right but it's still kind of a limiting experience it's kind of like okay I'm solving my my task with the wrong tool right in many ways and maybe I should not be like let's say Lucine since I mentioned it I can kind of continue using it for the sparse search for the for the normal inverted index retrieval but I can unlock so many new use cases with the vector search right and like find kind of new ways to show the value to the users because especially you know like in traditional search engines if you return let's say 100 results you know users don't have time sometimes to go through them right you basically offload a lot of do you feel that way or yeah certainly and there's a lot in there are a lot of interesting things in what you're saying so I mean so so again it depends on how you look at it bottoms up or top down so so you can make an argument from the from the bottom's up approach okay we have to infer the index or we have to the defector index and we can do certain things to this but what I also like to do is that I like to look at it from from a top down perspective and what I mean with it is this so if you work with a you want to build on a project for yourself you want to build on a project for you know with your students you want to build on a project for I don't know for your boss or for customer whatever how often do you actually say okay the tool that I'm not going to use to store my data isn't inferred index it probably doesn't happen that often I mean it's like it's like if you go to one of the the websites of these famous big companies that build databases around inferred indexes they don't go like this is the best inverted index around use us they say something else right so and they say like hey we help you with with enterprise search or we help you with with logging or we help you with service security needs and those kind of things and what I think where we are right now in the cutting edge of like where where where effective searches is like we are talking about it like you would be talking about these inverted indexes but I hope and that's one of the things that we try to do at with you know at some technologies around we've had it is to also talk about these new things and this is what you do with it so it's like hey we can't you can't you have like these recommendation systems in e-commerce you can do contextual search to e-commerce I don't know why it's stuck with e-commerce but I keep getting but or you can do contextual search to documents and those and those kind of things we I was talking about this this this amazing use case that had to do with a with a with a resume and had to do about this so there was like yet a resume and in and let's say that in the resume it says like I'm an IT director and I played in the the National Olympic Beach volleyball team that's what it says and now the request is like there's they're looking for somebody who's an IT director and who is interested in playing sports you're not going to find that person within infertile index but instead of talking about that from the perspective of like the infertile index can't find it because there's no relationship between directly between sports and being in the Olympic Beach volleyball team but with the with the effect index we can I actually like to find more words and better language to actually talk about these it's only perspective use case like contextual search, mentex search and those kind of things which I even think are still abstracting into a lot of people's ears but I think it's also very exciting so there's this new thing goes for you as well right so you're also helping with that you're helping to let the world know like hey look there's this new thing look what the things are that you can do with it so I think the point that I'm trying to make is that I I it's not that I disagree with your point I agree with your point but if we compare it with successful search engines now that might be based on infertile indexes but that's not how how we talk about them and I really think that say that's that we're like at the at the cost of that change that people select that they start to talk more in these in these from the perspective of the use cases and the things that you can build with them.
 Yeah absolutely I mean it's just you know like my engineering mind always kicks in and says like hey but you're basically offering me to replace a verded index with like vector search data structure but you are totally right like if an electric company would say hey buy our cars because we have the best battery and look how good it is and they they supply some diagrams there and showing how well it conserves the energy and stuff right maybe yeah we'll appeal to some clients who want to save the planet let's say right but the rest of the clients they will say okay why should I buy your car if it's slower right like you didn't focus on the use case I'm I'm kind of like advocating for right so and you you should always listen to your users on that one.
 Yes and so what you're saying is very interesting and this is something I was inspired by something which is called the the lavering problem which basically means that in the past and I was so this was for me the case too like I think like you know maybe 10 years ago or something that the user if I just go deeper drill down deeper deeper deeper deeper deeper and I understand how something works at the core that means that I understand the whole concept of something and the more I'm learning about this and the more I'm working on it the more I think that that's not the case so let me give you an example so there was this I saw this tweet coming by on the day that coin base did an IPO and I'm paraphrasing here what was in the tweet because I don't remember exactly but somebody found the hacker news post or somebody announced that they were working on coin base it might not even have been called coin base back then and he said okay I'm thinking of building a platform blah blah blah it's something like that well you should have seen the responses there because people like no wants to use that and that's not where these blockchain technologies are you know made for because we actually want to decentralize things blah blah blah regardless of the fact if you agree or disagree with the statement I think we can agree on the fact that coin base is doing pretty well and bringing a lot of value to people so the point that I'm trying to make with this story is that I think that the that the risk we run in constantly doing that deep dive and making the deep dive comparison which is important and which needs to happen and where we need to think on in the product itself and we also need to think in these other layers like how will people actually use that because don't bear in mind that the people currently that are involved in the discussion talking about the structure database and who are very vocal about it are people are extremely knowledgeable about what's happening in the hood but with it what if you're just a you know you're just working in the company and you're just like a normal software engineer and somebody says like hey I want to do better product search and you do a Google search on that you find a solution like we've yet you might be interested in knowing what's happening on your web but there's a limit to that you also you you come through it through the use case not not bottoms up but that's how I how I look at it so that yeah that's the point that I want to make I really like I really like your approach but like because I mean I was kind of joining this industry or entering this industry as an engineer and then I kind of progressed more like to work closer to product management management I did I didn't become a product manager but when I talk to them they really kind of want to hear too much about the algorithms right because it's not what they think about daily they think about solving user use cases right and and and sometimes they may ask how can I do this is this possible right and they give you a task right and then you go and like you come back to your toolbox and you're like okay what do I have here a couple of databases I have this queue system okay let me stitch things together and maybe this will work out right but you I agree to I agree with you that I think in many ways we we have that risk kind of in engineering kind of focusing too much on what's closer to us right let's say I enjoy using this IDE I enjoy using this compiler but what value it produces beyond me enjoying using it right the end result right that matters no absolutely and don't get me wrong as so I mean sometimes when we apply on our internal select channel when there's something you released in the software or then I enjoy that as well and or I can you know then I you know I play around with it and I go like it's amazing that this works or that we can do this or how fast things are or scalable they are don't get me wrong I enjoy that a lot but the things but I what I also enjoy and I think that's also the role that I have in this in this company and the role that I'm trying to play for us when it comes to vector search is if you for example have these product managers to actually listen to them and select what what problem can we solve and I don't think it's the responsibility of the product manager to take an example to understand how vector search might apply to their use case no we need to be able to express through the product managers how we can bring value to them because I don't think I mean of course there are product managers that say like okay for the next product we need to send our database but I don't think there are many asking a question they ask like okay you know we can absolutely it's a lot of data we can never lose the data architect or or engineer how are we gonna solve that and it's so it's different language to talk about these problems and what we now start to see is that that there's this wave coming that people express problems from a product manager perspective business owner perspective entrepreneur perspective that they that they say things or problems that they have for example hey somebody keeps typing and I'm having a headache in my search bar but they don't see us friend and then we need to go boom let's use case for we get yeah absolutely and it's like that's a great segue actually to the second part of the show you know like product managers answer the question what we're building right and engineers answer the question how and so I wanted you to kind of go and talk a little bit about how you implemented the avid and I understand that hgn maybe could also talk about it and I think he talked about it recently in a podcast and I'll be I'll make sure to link that in the show notes but what caught my eye and you know if you look at the landscape of the vector databases some of them are close source most of them up to now are open source and it's interesting distinction because some businesses decide you know we will keep it close because it's at the core of what we offer and you know maybe there are some risk elements involved for them maybe something else but that's that that's their choice your choice was to open source viv it can you talk a bit more about it yeah sure yeah sure so the so that goes back to us like so if we so you can if you have a use case you can package things together right that goes from the the the lowest level of the technology so just you know where the the bits and bytes begin and then where the where the index sits and how how it works and how it's optimized and how it's scalable and then you go up on up and then you get to to these to modules that you might want to use and then you get to these packages of additional tools that you might want to use for specific use case and then the question sits like okay where does the most value come from and what do people need to actually use this in production and what you try to do is that you try to somehow capture that value and then there are two things that we see in the case of viv yet because we've yet of course all these also with our competitors we evolve in different directions right which is good I think and is that we said like well there's a lot of value so if you look at our enterprise customers right what's very important for them is that that they want to have certain SLAs that they want to have certain sometimes they want to have the size of things sometimes they want to use things that are in these packages sometimes they want to have specific models they all can do that but that is where the most of the value for them is coming from they need viv yet to do it's always a viv yet a hard but it seldom lead up people specifically ask for that vector search engine so if you go back to that example what I gave like these famous search engines that you now have around are not promoted as like we have the best infertile index pieces of software that exists that goes a little bit the same for us so then you can select well if that's the case we could consider open sourcing it and then you can say well I can make a pro list and I can make a con list of open sourcing so because I have a business model right I know I want to build my business so what would be the the pro of open sourcing well one is transparency so you say like well we're building something completely new it sounds all very fancy we're gonna show the world that we're not you know we can actually do this so I very fancy told you like I said well we even have parts of assembly in the in the in the in the code well you can actually see that right so you can see how it's optimized you can see how it's functioned as one so what that has as an effect is that it builds trust so the second thing that happens is as I mentioned before we need to learn what these use cases are that people are building with vectors so we see people are building like crazy so our downloads are going up up up up up up over time and the other day somebody just published a great article about how they how they index 60 million data objects that we've yet were open sourced users but what we have what we learn from that we have this they it's like they're they're so kind to do they're basically promoting with yet they get a seat back they gave us help etc but there's also another thing sometimes an open source user finds a bug or finds something and the way that of course that the the the the the the software ecosystem is structured is at the moment that the fix comes in our customers have that fix as well so it's a it's a win-win so and the thing is customers don't mind that are open source users because if I have a customer that says like hey or prospect because hey Bob can I also use the open source first you say of course you can if you manage it yourself you're stuck with the open source license if something goes wrong and you can choose the sound software and then they go like well we we want all that so then it's interesting for them to um um uh uh to to to buy license what's also important to know is that these companies like ours were young companies so you're also trying to position yourself in the field and you try to show what you can do and I think that open source is an amazing vehicle um um uh to do that because as you probably know the the the the the the open source community can be very direct and that is great because then you learn from it and you can make things better so we've learned a lot from the from the um community so all in all it's currently is it is a net win to have it open source and it's because it's not it's it's helping us from an outreach point of view it helps us to build community and um it's not biting our uh business strategy yeah but that's well put uh but I wanted to still come back on the open source a little bit you know like you did mention these key elements that are not positive for you and they natively embed into your business model so to say right um but there is also one element that the open source like if you compare this this to close source let's say the way this would look inside your companies that you have internal you know roadmap planning and you chagelong just releasing stuff right and then you go directly through your sales you know to upgrade this installation so you become like a uh kind of corporate type of thing be to be deployments right um on the open source side you need to do an upfront work to maintain the connection you've built the community but you need to keep talking to the community right that's a lot of work as well so how do you see that part of the story yeah so that's a very interesting question actually so the um so what you see with it so i so in the end I think that community is not something that is um uh just a open source thing so let me give you an example a database company that I find very interesting is how they operate is a snowflake right can you say that because of data warehouse you know no no no vector search I can easily say that no but so I find it very interesting and I sometimes talk to people and they tell me you know what's an amazing company in how they build and help us build partnerships that snowflake never like wow that's interesting so they explain to me how they do it so the point that I'm trying to make they apparently are doing a great job in building a community uh but they're of course completely closed source so you need to build a community you know either way you need to have if people don't like your stuff um they'll move away and we know of a very famous database company where that is happening and uh uh so it's a um it's the old-fashioned company so that's fine but that way actually learned from them like actually you want to be you want to have a community you want to be nice you want to be great great products um because then people you know then the best marketing is basically where the mouth and so the point I'm trying to make is like I don't think we're limited to so sorry I meant community is not a thing only for open source you somehow want to show failure and then you build community about people using your technology saying something about your technology um etc yeah I mean absolutely I mean it's it's just the I guess the essence of my question was kind of like you know like if I if I maintain it as a closed source I can maintain my own standards and I can be let's say soc to compliant right for the auditing part of things so my business moves forward but when I'm open source I need to maintain a different level of standard like like documentation you know um code style you know uh the process of submitting you know pull requests and how how can I influence the VIVA direction and other things you know like it's a lot of support on your side you basically you support the clients right like those that choose your deployments your hosted version your cloud and then you need to support the community and I mean I'm not saying this is a bad thing I'm saying this is like a portion of your business model of your day-to-day life that is dedicated to that and you're doing a great job at that by the way I'm like super amazed like positive you are always like welcoming on slack and the count keeps increasing like regularly when I go back to VIVA Slack I'm like okay just few weeks ago it was 150 now it's over over 200 like what's going on so you know what was doing a great job and and the whole team um but I mean it's work it's work that's what I'm trying to do.
 Yeah yeah well I mean running a startup in general is it's a lot of work but I so I hear your argument but I'm just not I don't 100% agree with the argument so let me explain let me explain why so first of all like with the the the simple example I spoke to I don't know if everybody knows what SOK2 is but there was listening to the podcast but it's like it's the same right you can have an open source product that is SOK2 complying which is really is interesting again in from a business model perspective so you can say if you use this software open source it's not SOK2 complying if you use the exact same software with a different license it is SOK2 complying so it's a part of the open source this model so that that's one thing the second thing about for example maintaining documentation that is true but the thing is if you have a a close source solution somebody somehow needs to use the APIs as well so you still need a documentation for it so you still need to maintain the documentation so um so there I'm not sure if that argument still if that if that argument still still holds the only thing that is sometimes difficult is that um people ask a lot of questions so you sometimes see those on a slack they ask a lot of questions so as you want to be friendly and you want to um um you know you want to answer these questions there are two things related to that so one is like at some point of course you know okay see people ask like a lot of questions and they keep asking over and sometimes you friends they say you know maybe just watch this video first or read this part of documentation first or sometimes I also do that in the end and then just kindly just you know and direct them in it said I maybe want to start you want to start there so that that is one thing um there was something else that I wanted to say related to this uh oh yeah and the second thing and it's also something that I always tell the team is that sometimes an open source user might ask complicated questions not complicated as in that the question itself is complicated but just oh another question or why is he or she asking this but the thing is that I strongly believe that every question that you get has a core of truth to it so so if somebody makes a fuss about somebody asks a question then probably others have that problem as well and the the upside that you have from open source is that there's a lower barrier to entry people start to ask these questions and you you know you learn from them and I think it's completely fine to in return I sometimes if people ask specific questions I just ask them not on the public select of maybe in the DMs like hey may I ask what are you building with me yet because then there's this feedback loop and we're learning from it as well so it's a I hear your point but I do think that open source is evolving and the business models around it are you evolving as well and and and we're trying to benefit from it and again for now it's it's a net positive yeah thanks Bob it's it's very clear you know the reason I'm asking this question is because there is there's always something behind your choice right and it's like it's it's supporting your idea you drive in it but you know there is an alternative model as well you didn't consider it because you didn't want to go that path right you didn't want to go the close source path for your database because the way you as you said you want to get more feedback loops right with the community you want to learn more about the day use cases and this is fantastic way of getting it right like you you show it just transparently on the web you can either download it and host yourself or and probably that will happen when you run into some some issues here and there we will we will be there to support you right and and and you can you can contribute back if you get inspired by the tech itself your deep and tech you want to fix some things right or introduce a feature that is amazing yeah and don't get me wrong as I don't have any problems with close source even if I I mean I can make an argument for close source as well but I but I but I do think is that the that plays a role in your identity as a company so what kind of company do we want to be and how do we want to show that to the outside world and and yes that is that that comes with the complexity of meaning to deal with it but in the end it it works well so for example we also see so go back to these product managers right so what we see is that sometimes you know you have developers around the table and if developers see that it's they sometimes especially with with corporates the developers expect that we have the close source solution so then they see we've here they see this actually open source that makes them very enthusiastic about it and this is great then I you know I did an installation and I played around with it this is great which is then a positive feedback move back to the product manager and then everybody you know and everybody's happy so it's a it again it's a it's a it's a it's a it's currently a net positive and also I think when you build something new so you try to new niche yeah you create a new niche and we're not we're not alone but it's also not very crowded right you need to somehow show the world what that niches and what that niche can do in as many ways as possible so I think that I I dare to bet you a nice bottle of wine that for the 10 people that told me that they really like the fact that we've here this open source only one of them actually looked at the software itself right went in the folders looked at how it was written people do that the people get feedback on it but the for for a lot of people they just say hey it's great that your literature is open about it we got you what you know we understand it but you miss model is great um uh if this is this is working so it's it's building a it's a friendly way of approaching the market basically yeah I would argue yeah yeah and I think to close off on this like you know like um in my previous company when we were extending solar Apache solar you know um the reason we were extending it is because we had a very specific use case that wasn't solved by the community right and you know like as you as you go into the Apache solar documentation you couldn't find a lot of material there on that specific topic right and so what I had to resort to is reading the source code right and this is something that actually one of the um elastic search book authors I think Rafal could said you know if you have a question and nobody answers it on the mailing list or documentation doesn't have an answer go and read the code that's your answer right and if it's if it wasn't open source what would I do I would have to engage through some sales loop or what I would kind of like it would it would it would put the threshold to enter it so high that I would just kind of unbearably high I would say okay I will find something else maybe I will stop working on this problem right yeah exactly and just knowing that that's there even if you don't need it often works as a benefit don't what I what I don't have is and that's it surprisingly a lot of people ask me this but I don't have any moral reason to have something open source it's just something used that works very well for us and how we want to position ourselves so but it's a great question but it's uh I think to recap it just to position a vector search and with that we've basically in the world to show people that this is something that they can do and I think it's working wonders yeah absolutely and maybe we can kind of cover another topic that you've you've mentioned that you know you you are using at the core of the Bavid you're using certain algorithms you know for the vector search itself like building the index and the search algorithm and you have mentioned to me in private that you are using like H&S double which is a hierarchical navigable small world graph algorithm right that you have customized right can you talk a bit more why you did it like and you did mention crude right so that you needed to add crude yesterday I was checking their repository and they actually the original authors they already added crude there because probably there been some other use case coming from elsewhere you know can you add it and and I was coming with my new use case by the way that I was saying can I load the first layer of the graph somehow with one single and then I have to go and read their code this is another beauty of the source code I can read it right but can you talk a bit more uh why why you customized H&S double you and did you implement it in go in the end yeah yeah so so two parts of that so the um I did not do that implementation so the the we we earlier referred that other podcaster listeners really want to go into the near degree about it then I would highly recommend listening to that podcast but I believe that you're also going to link it so um and the answer to your question was basically already in your in your question right so the the thing is that we the problem that that we needed to solve is that if you so you can take a um in an library but some of them are immutable and then the problem is like so then if you change something you need to rebuild it again that is something you don't want in a database because if you go back to that use case of for example the recommendation engine you somehow want to real time add a product to a card and somehow real time want to deal with that so then you are air quotes limited to a an algorithm that supports that and that was for us um uh H&S W was the was the right fit however um as you you can actually see that also in our documentation we not only have modules but the an n is actually also plug-in so currently we only have H&S W but there's no reason we're looking at others as well that in the future we're going to release other um an n plugins as well within we've it that you as an enthusiast can actually choose what you want to use but the only the the requirement that we have for such an um uh uh an algorithm is there basically when you say like okay we need to somehow have that crot support and or we need to build add crot support to it could even be the case that in the future it's um you know we're gonna support other use case for that's not the case but that's for now and uh to the second part of your question yes that's actually a customly built which you can of course see in the pit of repo you see a full circle yeah that's the value all along right so um and hopefully you know like in the end in the end of the day it's like if you guys and then something in part of H&S W that you implemented in in in glow and you published it as as code the original authors may also look at it right and they might you know take that idea and bring it back to the implementation and then that of course you know just as a side uh product will benefit some other part of of the community but you will be there as well right because like you know it's the authorship or you know the credit that that will be given to you because you did it right so i mean that that that's very interesting like you can benefit and reach out to you to even like new users potentially right or they will know about your existence um through this through this link no exactly and i think so and and the thing is what happens with with a solution like like with it is that it so it's like yes it has that in an algorithm at its at its heart at its core but there's so much around it with with with the scalability um the capability that it has with the way of also storing in the the data objects that actually building that yourself kind of it's very comparable to for example Lucine and solar or Lucine and Elasticsearch so how i like to talk about it in a comparison as i said i like to about take the an n algorithm as the as in your mind as Lucine i mean the the comparison isn't a hundred percent correct but to make my point and then that whole thing that's for example solar or elastic build around it that is what we're trying to do with these with these algorithms um so you could that's how you could kind of compare it right rafan just that we said i'll re-give you this out of the box but i do want to reiterate that yes we have these power users that really want to know that nitty-gritty that want to make those changes but the majority of users the the i like to call them the silent majority of users they just have like okay i have a hundred thousand documents i know a hugging phase model that i like how am i gonna quickly search through it period and then they find we fit so it's a that's that's the the majority of users and they probably don't even know what hnsw is which is fine right so that's perfectly fine because they do other things they might be edits that layering what i said like they just sit in another layer that they look at it so um i think the cool thing of our modular system is that we can make these power users at the core happy but we can also have these more generic developers or full stack developers we can make them happy or even in the outer layer we can make these these product managers happy and that's what we you know what we what we focus on but all to a single core and and to to a set of modules that are those are immutable basically so it's not it's not that we have like two types of weviators one weviate probably support all these use cases yeah and and i mean you know like for those of us who really want to go deep into detail and you know like the analogy that just kind of came to my mind is that if you take my sequel or some some sequel database right when you choose the type of the field that you index right and you are thinking okay it's gonna be a B3 or it's gonna be full text or it's gonna be some other data structure that sequel database offers to you that's when you start asking questions what is the trade-off right of choosing that version or the other version but you may also kind of just index the data and then kind of solve your use case first right and only when your product manager comes back to you and says hey why is this slower than yesterday can you improve right exactly exactly and what i find interesting and important where we now are in the in in in the cutting edge where where vector search in general sits is that yes it's very important to talk about to be transparent about to to share about or or not share depending on your opener close energy about how these things work what kind of algorithms are used on it etc that is very important and that's also as you mentioned earlier something that we are very active in by the way not only as so for example my colleague i chain is doing that from the from the core of vivid but my other colleague Laura is more doing that from graph ql perspectives and like how can these queries when they leave yet etc but i think it's also important to if you we take your my sequel example what do people use my sequel for or in our case what do they use vector search for and how can i communicate to these people who have absolutely no idea what an what an an algorithm is and and i think that those are the three pillars that we stand on so the the core the interface and the use cases and and we try to cover these three pillars within semi based on one code dates yeah that's fantastic i mean what what you do there and like i will link the yeah like self what is it selfish plug so that the block was basically explains you know a few details of six vector databases couple of which are close source the rest are open source you know you can actually see you know for yourself like what what is happening there in those databases and then so much material there and like don't go too technical yet kind of stay in the use case part and kind of like and and i and i hope i we can like as the community collaborate more in bringing these use cases kind of highlighting them i just alluded to you know similarity code search or you know encoding some software viruses into that representation and then searching similar viruses when you need to do that and you're like yeah so i mean there are so many use cases that um it's our job in many ways to connect and you're doing a great job there really i do to connect the the use cases with the tech right so like don't fixate on the tech yet because tech isn't going to improve over time there will be new cool algos by the way the billion scale competition going on there will be probably new algorithms right that will be done performance and then eventually performance will stop mettering in a way right like it will be something else it will be like okay you know what can i do yes yeah so and and let me if i may make it a quick metaphor there i mean probably this metaphor is used many times for for the technology but just to to to make it as well it's like you know the other day i ate at a great restaurant with a friend of mine with great amazing food it was great atmosphere great food everything right so that is the that it would be the the metaphor the use case that you have but my friend you know she said like i actually want to know how they make this so she also bought a cookbook right with the recipes in it so now she could go into the book and she could actually go even a level deeper and actually see how the chef prepared the the dishes which is fine i was not necessarily i was i just wanted to have like some nice food in a nice glass wine she want to know a little bit more and i think if we're smart about this and i think also that is the where open source business development is now in you know 2021 almost 2022 is that you can actually cater that to that whole stack if you do that smart and because they you know they they click into each other so i so the point is like you said i i don't think that the the technology and talk about technology is also very important but i don't think it's the only thing we should talk about i think we should make sure that we talk about both and that are constantly aligned that's also within how we talk about we get internally that is that is that is aligned but people use different words and different ways to describe the technology of people that are you know helping me on the business development they use different words they never talk about hnsw like the people in the core tech team do but they have a great understanding about the use case that are being sold so and i think that all needs to come together and we are an amazing point in time where that's happening perfect research so i think that's just that's just amazing and by the way kudos to you as well right so you're you're you're carving out your own niche as well there so good for you that's nice you know it's cool to see yeah being independent kind of in this field because it also open opens doors to talk to to guys like you really and and and you know like if i was your competitor maybe you wouldn't want to talk to me necessarily not not on the right it would be a discussion it's a different discussion yes and at the same time as i said in the first episode i'm actually educating myself a lot on this so in the process of this i hope to share um you know the learnings and and and benefit everyone including myself so so that's that's that's the that's the way to go forward so kind of on the open source side right so i'm open sourcing more exactly and uh yes exactly hey Bob so you you you really shared so much inside in in what you do on the product side in at bavv8 as well as technology i want to drill into more into this kind of philosophical level why you do this and when i say why like i mean you personally right and that probably propagates to your team as well and we can even ask everyone on your team why you guys do this right but you are the visionary you are the core of this like what brings you to this field you are the forefront of it yeah so it's like the that's a great question by the way so thanks for asking so the um so when i was working on just experimenting with these with these models and these and these representations and i started to do research on actually how much how big is this how much unstructured data is there actually that we could potentially help it then i found that this was so big and at some point i was just walking down the street literally and i was and if you just walk down street it's like like in the matrix when when you see everything like that it's this matrix i was like wow every company that i see every truck that i see driving by an airplane that i see coming over a warehouse that i see they could potentially use with you and that's that the dream that i just can walk down the street and i was like oh you see the truck there yeah the company uses us to do x oh you see the hospital over there yeah they use us to do y etc etc and that is such a thrill to be in that in a new niche and trying to um uh trying to build that product and and try to build it a solid product and bring that to you know that new product to people solve new problems that is a personal driver plus something that is just something that i'm personally very interested in and that's something that you already i guess noticed by the way that i you know my answers and that grew over time is that i became interested in that that layer between you have the the tech and how people use it there's like and there's like this this overlapped there i'm interested in that overlapped and like how do people use the technology how does that create value and how can we bring it to them and how can we capture some of that value and that is something that i'm extremely interested in and and this is just you know some of my technologies and then we've had this product is vehicle to do that so it's like if we then it just you know everything big and we think about this new niche with new database technology then just let's just go all in and just see you know how far we can bring this and that that's way more to say about this but the um um it's it's such an exciting time to work in in this and so that's my personal reason why i do this and um so yeah so that yeah since since you are so big on use cases is there a specific use case that drives you the dead gets sold maybe it wasn't sold yet maybe it was already sold by the way in your in your videos you know like you always kind of quite frequently you say okay imagine a wine store right and thinking i'm thinking probably there is a good wine in in the holand i should when when i travel let's let's get together and drink some good wine but you know like is that the use case that drives you is there something else that you think could be sold by via the eight oh no so it wasn't yes so the what what drives me is the there are certain use cases um that could be i think and i'm now doing this from the top of my head that you could um you could look at them from the perspective of size so that a that big you know large corporates are working with vj trying to solve problems that i go like this is amazing that they use this right that is that is something that i want hand that that drives me the other hand what drives me is that people were looking at Weaviate to to use it to um where it has an impact in people's lives so that can be medical use cases or even in even go as far as the HR example that i gave right and i'm a little bit vague about these use cases because we still working on them um but so when they're big or when they have an important positive impact on people's lives that is amazing so if i present to certain people results um uh uh for for these big use cases and you see these you know people their eyes they go open they go like wow okay i actually do that that's amazing that is that is the most that's that's the coolest thing that's that's around and um and there's also the there's something in and i don't want to sound too vague about it but that's something in exciting about um um uh with with with with machine learning i guess and especially with nlp so one of the things that we are working on and we hopefully gonna release uh perv as soon as as as a demo that i said is that is that um we loaded the complete Wikipedia into vh8 just the whole thing and so we're not talking about almost a hundred million paragraphs and um i watched an an an an an an an an an an antenna hopkins move the other day and i typed into we get just an aircraft you're upgraded like you know um uh which actor played Hannibal actor or something and then in a few milliseconds it says antenna hopkins and they go like whoa and that is so cool if that actually works and if that happens that is very yeah that just gives me a thrill and so i would say these three things are why i'm why i'm doing yeah that's super exciting it's like you know like the uh if i was asking the same question to me then the word semantics right the similarity yes that would drive me because i actually did my PhD uh in in um machine translation and my supervisor developed a semantic parser you know it wasn't syntactic parser and i cannot still find an analogy on on the market for for for this work uh but like it was driving me that the way he was explaining this is that hey i really now read tall story you know with my parser every single day right and it fails i fixed it it fails i fixed it but sometimes it amazes me because tall story tends to create so long sentences that they can take several pages you know in Russian right i don't know how it books in the translation by the way i've never seen the translation but in in the Russian source and tall story has written his book nine times his books it's it's like several books right like the the war in peace i mean and like you know so like he was basically compiling the language using his parser and he was fascinated by this like okay this is the semantic layer and and i was constantly thinking you know i defended my thesis in 2011 and i was thinking okay how can i apply this tech in real life and it was very difficult because this parser is kind of implemented in force and i don't code in fourth i don't know if you heard of this language it's like it's used in the industry it's high performance and like but it's functional you know it's yeah so like you can express many things with just one single word and then it just unwinds there behind the scenes and you're like okay how do i debug this right so and there was a port to java is well done by another student but i was kind of constantly fascinated by this field like how can i bring semantics into the word of numbers and into the word of like well let's put it inverted in the system what that's like since i mentioned it meant yeah no but i like this extra much what you're saying and it's like i and this goes again a little bit out of the realm of the technology i mean you use the technology but it goes out of it i remembered that there was before the whole pandemic it there was like i was speaking at a conference in London and they were so nice to book me at the or to have me at the large stage and so i had like this big screen and i'm talking about vf8 and i'm giving it demo and i could see the first few front rows and that what you said before the q and a example so i do just i give a q and a example and i and i just get a real demo and what i always do is then the moment when i present an audience and i clicked like to you know to execute the query and get the response back then i always look at the people that i'm presenting to and you see these people go like they sit like in order to just watch your screen and they go like and that's like and i go like that's such a cool thing so something that that we as a team came up with and everybody participated in building the thing and then people enjoy seeing that and enjoy using that that's that's amazing that's like uh uh yeah that's just you know that's just fantastic so and language has that that additional element to it right so that that people you know it does this how we communicate and and we get closer to have the the machines communicate you know that we can communicate more natural language based with people yeah that's that's that's amazing so that that that would be another that would be a fourth line of doing it yeah yeah that's fantastic that's so so deep and you know like i'm happy that we also connect with you on that topic you know the semantics when you you can park all other items like technology use cases product but the semantics part where we are driving this thing it's it's just amazing and i'm happy for you guys to be doing this and i think part of the excitement of being at the edge of of doing things is also kind of you know launching things and like kind of like announcing something is there something you would like to announce yeah so yeah certainly so i think the so one thing that already mentioned a bit so we we're going to launch that huge data set just the whole big video with everything and also for people to try it out and to play around with so that they can see actually how big it gets and related to that and we already actually have an impree release but it's going to be released very soon just as a standard release is everything related to horizontal scalability so that people can now you know scale from into the millions into the into the billions and we starting to get these kinds of questions in and we're very close and it's like i was in like very very very very close because the pre-releases are ready out there and and that then goes full circle back to people ask i get sometimes emails from people say yes so we have like you know a x billion factors but you probably can say well all choices we may probably can and i go like but can you also store the metadata you can also store the metadata and then people go they're really excited so it's just that just keeps going and going and so those are the big two things that i that i want to share because the there's a lot of people asking for this and so we're probably going to make a lot of people happy when it's when it's out of the pre-release yeah that's fantastic i mean it both sounds so big and you know i'm actually spending my time now figuring out how to scale i participate in the billion scale competition actually by the way and i'm like i'm i'm waiting with excitement for this release because i would like to learn things from you guys as well and like if you solve that and you open source many things and you will open source this part as well so it's it's it's amazing you know what you do and and i'm waiting with excitement to learn what you've done so thanks so much and thanks so much thanks so much for your time as well i mean we we went so deep today and in many areas and i'm sure we can talk more at some point down the road probably we probably can and thank you so much for having me and keep up the great work because you're doing a great you know job in the uh um you know in the community and in the industry yeah thanks so much Bob my pleasure and uh see you next time bye cool thank you bye music
