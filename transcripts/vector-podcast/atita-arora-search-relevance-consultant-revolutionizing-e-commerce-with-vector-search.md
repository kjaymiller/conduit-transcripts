Hello there, vector podcast. We are still in season 2. If you forgot, you can always go back and check season 1. We had some really awesome guests there. Today I have a big, big pleasure to talk to Atita Aurora, who is the search relevance consultant with open source connections.
And she has spent quite a bit of time in search field in NLP. I'm really curious to learn her journey and talk some of the topics that we usually talk on this podcast like, you know, search vector, what vector search and also, you know, aspects of profession.
Hey, Atita, how are you doing? Hi, pleasure to be here, to be in tree. And I mean, before we start, I think a huge shout-out for you that this is the great thing that you're doing. And I mean, I'm feeling pretty excited to be here today. Yeah, thanks, Atita. You're very kind.
And this is what also gives me energy, you know, when people like you say that this makes sense to continue doing. And I really enjoy it myself because I learn so much. I connect with all my guests on a different level in the podcast. And I hope that this is also informative for our listeners.
At least when I release and all the podcasts, all the episodes so far, I kind of like, you know, really remember and I learned something new. It's kind of cool. Yeah, I was just wondering like, we usually traditionally start with with your background. And this is where people can learn more.
But I know that you've been blogging and you've been talking publicly on conferences. But still, it's very interesting to know, you know, how did you arrive at this profession? What was it journey? Yeah, I think that's actually an interesting question.
And I mean, usually when I'm speaking at conferences, I do have this about me slide, which obviously I tend to just get through because I feel like it's so repetitive now, of having presented so many times. But I think I never really talk about as to how I started where I started.
And I think it would be nice if it was documented somewhere to look at when I get older and I can tell my kids or my, you know, grandkids that this is what I did it. Thanks to you for that. By the way, I'm also one of the regular subscribers of the Vector Podcast.
Absolutely all your episodes and obviously whenever you publish, I'm like probably the first ones to check them out. So how I started is kind of interesting. I was a master's students and I was supposed to finish my master's, that is, a master's in computer application in 2008.
However, our college, which is, I mean, I am from one of the top notch institutes, which has like a common attitude test. It's like about 400 K people every year take that test and about 100 people selected. And I was one of them. So obviously it was already very prestigious.
And we had this culture that, you know, if the course is for like three years, that is full time course, we would already get our placements in the year two.
So the company that I got placement with was a very small company and I think I have some sort of, you know, radar that I'm always attracted to small companies because I feel like I get a lot of accountability, a lot of things to do.
Apart from the stated rule in my job offer, which is what I kind of like as well. So it was interesting that I also reached out to them in 2007.
So I was supposed to complete in 2008, but I reached out to them in 2007 itself that I have to complete my industrial project, which is supposed to be like a dissertation thing that you do in PhD. So it was supposed to be a real life project.
And I reached out to them that can I join the company and like kind of do the training. And I mean, it was really nice of them to let me come. However, they didn't really have any kind of like training programs.
And they were experimenting with the solar and losing and blown and zo at that point in time. I'm not sure how many people would really know about zooping alone. They are like the Python based. I don't I don't at least. Yeah, that's actually because it was really a thing back then.
So it is a content based content management system, which is based on Python. And at that point in time, you know, Java was really a thing back then when I started in 2007, eight.
So having worked on Python, I was like, why am I working on something which is like Python? I mean, I want to work on Java, you know, J to E. That is really a thing like build cool applications.
But because I was a trainee and they could obviously, you know, kind of modulate, you know, my role, they asked me to research on, you know, solar and losing because they were coming up with the social networking website application. So Orkut was leaving the space.
Facebook was coming in and we were working on this Facebook application, which could let two people talk without knowing each other's number.
And that was all through like what would pop in my, you know, profile, like who are the people who are close to me? And this was all supposed to be based out of Lucine and solar.
So this is all, I mean, it started off with that I was literally pulling out all my hair at that point in time because you can imagine how immature solar was at that point in time. We didn't even know like which version of Lucine would go along with which version of solar.
So we were trying and testing and there were so many things which were missing as well. But I think I got pretty much, you know, soaked up even though I at first I did not find all of that interesting because my friends were doing Java, G2E and dot nets.
So I was like I'm missing out on something I would, you know, catch up with them and they would talk about all, you know, cool applications that they're building and how database connections, etc. were working.
And I was talking about yeah, I'm building this, you know, data and we're trying to locate people on Google maps and yeah, Google is really a thing. So it was like I'm speaking a different language altogether and people were like what? So it was it was interesting though.
So you felt like an underdog or something? Yeah, I felt like that. And on top of it, I think the bigger challenge was that we had this guy who was basically from the ontology's word. So semantic web was very underplayed at that point in time.
I think right now it's like coming up as if something really fancy and all of these things that are really seen in like big light were not really known as they were. So I was asked to find, you know, like the application has this feature that I could place people in the circle.
Like for forse really a thing friend of a friend. So the major I think the breakdown for me was, you know, dealing with the relationship. Every person is a document and finding relationship between these documents was something that was given to me.
And I was like why why God why am I supposed to you know, do this thing? So relationships and ontologies and visualizing this stuff. So we implemented this visual map using cluster map API back then. And I mean, now when I look back, I feel like that was like very cool stuff that I did back then.
It sounds very cool actually. It is. Modeling Graph using Lucine. It's like not necessarily something people do or at least I don't know about that. Actually, and we did not really have any cluster monitoring tools as well. So we built something by ourselves as well.
So using GraphWiz, we built, you know, like how each of the clusters are doing. So we had this thing that obviously cluster was not something that solar supported back then, but we actually made our own cluster.
But one of the things that I would also like to mention here is that we we did not really, I mean, at least I was or my manager was not really aware of like all of this could be contributed to open source.
So we were like living in our own world, trying to, like build something really cool only for the client, but not really for I think a public. And I think this is something that came way later in my life.
Yeah, I guess, I guess probably like before you contribute, at least how I feel myself when I also doubled in solar a bit, you know, in the beginning and then it took 10 years of in my life. I actually don't want to say off my life. It sounds so negative.
But like, you know, in the beginning, you still need, if you're like a startup or something, you still need to figure out whether this works or not, right?
Whether this solves some needs for your users, how much of this you want to still keep as a business secret, how much is okay to contribute because you might see even more development in this, right? And get to feedback.
Absolutely. Absolutely.
 And, you know, having joined a company that was not really like, you know, big companies back in India, I think maybe you would get an idea as to how cool or, you know, how small the company was that in my induction program, like the first day when I joined, I was being asked that, you know, grab a cup of coffee and watch this movie.
The movie was Pirates of Silicon Valley. So they said, you know, we don't want you to have any rocket science e-scales. We were just make you, you know, learn all of that stuff. Just get this mindset. And I think that's what I tried at. I love that movie actually.
I think there are two versions of it, right? The original and some kind of remake if I'm not mistaken. Right. That's correct. I think I watched the original one. The original one is amazing. It's like almost this kind of, you know, it's like a meditation. You go into that state of mind. Indeed.
Yeah. We have a lot to learn from that movie. Yeah. But I think just like everyone else, I was also, you know, in India, I think we do have a lot of pressure of academically, you know, like building, grooming ourselves.
So when I started in 2008 and then, you know, got married in 2009, had my first gig in 2010, I think it was the time when I had to take a break. But when I did it come back in 2011, things were obviously had changed.
And someone, you know, told me that, you know, it would be a good idea to have more of, you know, like a hands-off kind of a role. And that made me think about, you know, going for an MBA. And I pursued MBA in 2014.
And I decided that I would leave development because it's too demanding and I cannot manage that with a child. And when I became a manager, I also took up a job as a manager. I did that for like two and a half months.
 And I was like pretty bugged because, I mean, obviously, you know, once a developer, always a developer, I think I started always, I mean, I felt like a little bit, you know, more triggered or more, you know, joy in seeing how things really work and not really by having, you know, said that, you know, this is how, this is what we need to do with an application.
Like, this is the client requirement. This is the BRD, like a business requirement document and then go implemented. So I think which is why after two and a half months, I just decided to come back to the, that's where I belong.
And was there something in the first place that prompted you to take the manager role? Was it just the fact that you were going out of the maternity leave and you thought you will do better in management? Was there something else going on? I think that that's also interesting.
I think there are two sides of this, you know, answer. The first one was, you know, people usually associate and this is actually true that, you know, in a dev role back in India, because we have a lot of, you know, sourcing work. The clients are usually based out of US.
We have long hours of working and usually the client calls would happen in the evening, because we have like 12 hours or 10 hours of difference. So by the time you're ending your day, you have your client calls and you have to stay back in office. And that's probably not like that for our managers.
They have little more perks. And I think that's what someone suggested. And I think I tried to play along, although I mean, I don't regret doing MB at all, because it's, it just helped me understanding like what my manager is going through.
I mean, how is he thinking like, how should I behave? So that just gave me also the context of the other side of the table. So I don't regret it. But in some sense, it's, if I capture it, right, it sounds that maybe it wasn't the most natural move for you to take the manager role.
Maybe it was just some circumstantial in a way, right? You thought it would be better, easier with your new responsibilities in the family, right? That is good. Yeah. And I mean, I would say like, you know, personally, maybe women have obviously changed.
It's been five years I've moved to Berlin now. And until I moved and all, you know, women professionals that I know, my friends in India, I think they still have this problem of clearly communicating what they want in their job I mean, if you can't do that, I think you are already an awesome woman.
I was not one of them. It was always like something that, you know, people would see me as less if I'm asking for like, I need to be at home with my kid, because he's too small. He may need me.
But I always try to, you know, keep things to myself and try to, you know, change myself, try to leave what I was passionate about just to fit into that frame, like how women should be, how a mother should be, or how a wife should be. So that was something I learned very hard way. Yeah.
And it's like something that, I'm sure we will touch this on this topic later in the podcast, but like, it's something that is kind of implicit. And when we talk about men, maybe they don't feel that.
And again, it depends on the culture where you come from, you know, in my culture, you know, men also like assign this responsibilities that you should be the man who earns money and hands all your decisions need to be based in order to maximize that probability that you will be that person.
But maybe you don't want that path, you know, maybe you still want to go and explore what is it that you like.
And so it's interesting that how culture and, you know, society shape us in that direction, until we just carry the momentum until we realize, hold on a second, am I going in the right direction? And this would happen to you? True, true. That that was the exact same thing.
And again, I think the major bump came in that there was this company or or training company. So to say, let's put it more precisely, who reached out to me, which was like far away, at least from the place I lived in.
And they said, like, could you remotely, you know, develop this solar curriculum for us for our training? And it was probably the first, you know, big things that happened to me. And I was like, okay, I mean, I work on the application that uses solar-avue solar before things have changed now.
And that was in 2014, was they come back? Like, oh my god, solar is like still working. Like people are still working on this. Okay, wow, amazing. That's when I realized, okay, solar has really transformed. The community has grown. And it was interesting.
I think that was more like, you know, meeting my old friend solar in a whole new, you know, a tire like with dinner jacket and suit and with a tie. And I was like, oh my god, dude, you are popular now. So that was that was the thing for me. And preparing that course curriculum for them.
I think that was when I learned about all, you know, the developed features that were available in solar back then. Also learned about elastic storage back then as well. But that training became such a hot cake because I would give, you know, public webinars.
Obviously, we're was being paid for that too. There were like almost like 400, 500 people on those webinars to see like what this course is all about. Everyone wanted to become, so there was no rules, such as search engineer, like the engineer who knows about search more or less.
But we would take like 25 people only in that course, or maybe even less sometimes. But I think preparing the course curriculum was one thing.
And then conducting that course for the first time was completely next level because I did not imagine like people who would come to that course would come with like 10 or 20 or 30 years of experience in Java.
So to imagine like people are really asking me questions very low level, like what is happening when you know, face-sitting is happening? How is this, you know, a variable, you know, is it in the, you know, like a memory or is it in like somewhere else?
Like what would have like, like, performance wise? Can I improve this? And I was like, I mean, I am literally like stumped because imagine like this was 2014.
I started back in 2008 professionally after completing my studies. So six years and that took with a break of like one and a half years and competing with the knowledge of like low level code in Java with a person who's been working on Java for like 25 years. Obviously was something.
And I would always say, and I hope people who are listening to this did not, you know, recall like I'm saying all of this out loud on a podcast, but I would say like I have nine years of experience. But even nine years was less at that point in time because these people are like always very senior.
And which made me, you know, like take break from my office, like literally understand from the code level, like how each of these features were working. Although it was solely done to like, you know, literally save my reputation at that point in time.
But I realized like the benefit or the grooming that it brought along was like way bigger. I think that understanding that was like, I would say like a major breakthrough. You reminded me of, I don't remember was it 2011, probably, and Berlin buzzwords. There was some raffle for whatever.
Like I want a book written by Rafale Kutz on Elasticsearch. And he actually wrote like a couple words there. And he said, if you don't find answers in this book, then read the code. And like, you know, the code is also open source.
And I was like, this was like such a big opening to me in some sense, even though I was coding by then. I was like, hold on a second. So if I don't find what does it mean? So this book doesn't contain all the answers, you know, like major things. And it's pretty thick book, you know.
I was like, yeah, wow. So it just tells you that how experimental you need to be, right? And that there are no given answers, right? Right. So true. Yeah, that's exactly how it is. And then while giving this training, I mean, I ran almost like seven eight batches.
One of the person was my student who recommended my profile to Lucidworks. And that's how I got into Lucidworks. And I discovered a whole new word of open source. Oh, so now you can write code and, you know, contribute or, you know, shape the product as well.
Like I can really define like how the solar function would work.
Like I've always, you know, being on the other side, like complaining, like, oh, you know what? I don't like, you know, how this shows on UI or I don't like, you know, why it forgets about this thing or how about you, you know, if I could change this behavior.
So instead of, you know, just making that change in my local copy, I could actually open source stuff. I could actually contribute as to how product shapes. And I think that was like, you know, like you're a car moment for sure for me. So, yeah.
And at that point, you moved to the US for that job or you were already in the US. So I moved briefly to US, but as I said, like by that time, I already had my second kit, who was six months old. And it was not very, you know, practical for me to stay there by myself.
And which is why I decided to come back, uh, leave my job there in Lucidworks. And I started my own consulting company called bistro innovation labs. I know the name would sound like as if it's a restaurant.
And the reason, I mean, there are like a lot of things that people used to ask me like, why is it called bistro innovation lab? Like you should have something like a sci-fi formula or like some math algo in the name.
Why would you keep it like a bistro? And I was like, because I'm so passionate about cooking, I think, I forgot to probably mention that during my intro. I got so excited. But yeah, I think a food part is something that really, really, uh, you know, brings the best in me.
I think if my staff or whatever I'm doing is not really working, I think if you do not find me on my desk, uh, you would find me in my kitchen. So that's mostly, uh, you know, where my word lies. Some dangling between my desk and my kitchen, because I think I love it that way.
And that's what I call my company as well.
But do you think there is some connection actually?
I think at some point, I even like vlog really briefly, uh, about this, uh, as I was just learning how to cook, I guess, uh, there's some connection between how you write code from scratch and how you cook before you learned how to cook that particular dish, right?
Like you can assemble from building blocks and like in that order.
Right. I think, I think that's an interesting point. I mean, it does function the same way. And it's obviously like the experimentation is something like you would experiment with different cuisines. Like usually I have, I mean, I don't really do that. I don't change the basic nature of the food.
I mean, if it is German food, it should be German food. I mean, I would not try to Indianize the food. Uh, but I think somewhere I do that and that experimentation is something that I would also connect with like creating something.
And I think that's, I mean, I never thought about it from that aspect, but yeah, I think good point, good core religion, so to say. Yeah. Absolutely. And then what happened next? So you opened your bistro innovations lab? True. And I think that landed me a job in Germany.
Uh, and interestingly, I had never been a Germany before. And for me, I mean, I had been to London before I had been to US before. So to me or precisely so to say, you know, I'm trying to wrap all the Indians that would say, for us, every foreign country, you know, we can speak in English.
But I think the biggest trauma was like when I landed in Germany in Berlin. And I realized that, uh, English gay niche. And I realized that, you know, it would be very difficult.
 But I think I had, I had a tough year in 2018 when I decided to move here for several reasons, because I was trying to make sure like my, you know, family settles here will at the same time trying to, you know, have a little bit of a grip on the language as well, like my work at that point in time.
But I decided to close the company afterwards. Sadly, you couldn't keep it. I could not. Yeah, there are some general notes. So it doesn't work. And did you, but you did have clients on it? Like you did the, oh yes, I had clients. I had clients. I had three pretty major clients back then.
And I think one thing that somebody commented about it yesterday as well. And they say that I come across subtle, you know, in a very subtle way, you know, very straightforward way. And this is something that people do not expect me to be. But I think that subtleness came way, hard way to me.
And I want to preserve it that way. So one thing that I try to set an example also for my kids is that I don't lie. I try to make things as clear as possible. So I tried communicating to my clients that, you know, I would not be able to work because I have already my hands full.
And I'm trying to settle in a new country, trying to manage my family, also helping, you know, my husband who did not have a job back then. But I mean, if you can adjust with that, we can still keep working.
But then I would not charge you for that because I mean, anyway, I would be paying taxes for it. So I think eventually, I mean, it was like more like one or two calls a week. And then it transformed into one call of a, then one call in two weeks, and then one call of month.
And then eventually I just lost all the clients. And I think that's when I decided to close it out. Yeah, yeah. That may happen. But but the still you have the, you know, the affinity to boards search world, right? And develop. I do have. I do have.
And I am working as a search relevance consultant now with open source connections. I think one of the reasons that I decided to work with this company, I mean, they are well known search consulting companies in the space.
And the mission statement that, you know, they want to empower the search teams of the word that really, you know, is something that really rings a bell, you know, or I would say like it shines with what I want to do.
Basically, I mean, you know, all of us have this, you know, mindset that we all want to do something for money and something for what we really are passionate about. So I think that's really nice like how I connect because I feel like I resonate with the model of the company.
I mean, I also want to, you know, empower people and like share my knowledge as open source or like, I mean, if I'm getting paid for it, even better. But yeah. And I think it is also different from how traditional consulting companies work.
Like I have been with consulting company myself in a starting of my career. And I feel like that the companies who are taking the services of these consulting companies are more like, you know, very closely tied. I mean, it's like, you know, being mad at with them forever and ever.
Like, no, turning back now, you're always, you know, going to be with us. And I think that's where it's source connection. It's like job security for some businesses, probably, right? That is true. Kind of like working model.
And you're saying that, you know, in open source connections, it's the opposite. And it's actually clearly stated that what you said, empower search teams to learn and become independent if they want, right? Exactly. That kind of entice the whole situation. You don't need to really be exactly.
And if you look at its very natural, like, you know, we help teams to, you know, fish their own fish. It's like, you know, we are unblocking them to achieve their goals. I mean, if you think of it from a video game point of view, like, and then they will be stuck at some other point.
I mean, by then the context would have changed and they would have swim through like their initial challenges. So, I mean, as a consultant, I would also get a new use case next time. So it's like, you know, we keep on learning with our clients.
And I think that's what really excites me about my job. That sounds great.
And I mean, when you think about search, really, what are the companies that are so publicly known and shining and doing so many things, but open source connections, you know, with haystack, grandparents in Europe and in the US with all the tooling, you know, like, cube it and beyond.
Like, I think it's in part, I think why this podcast also exists is because to keep going and discussing and keeping that connection open that we talk and we develop the thought further and we share our experiences.
And I think in many ways that's what open source connections has been so successfully doing.
And what is your role there in little bit more detail? So about my role, I think things, and again, another thing is that I love about my job is that I have independence in terms of like what I choose to work on.
So when I talk about an engagement, I mean, there have been cases when I've been strategist, also been an engineer.
So I get, I would say, like enough time to, you know, research about stuff, I get time to also be hands on, I get time to, you know, explore stuff and, you know, develop good solutions also as a council to the company that we work with.
And I think individually as well, like, you know, you feel really valued. Like if I want to have some transition, like, for example, if you would, you know, like to bring this in, because it's a vector podcast, like I added vector search to chorus.
 So I think chorus is so to say, like a small, you know, like experimental, you know, webshop that bunch of, you know, folks started off, I think Eric Pugh and Renee and Paul and I think there are a bunch of other folks who tried to bring together, you know, all the two links, which is needed to run a webshop or e-commerce shop.
And I think with all this buzz that I was, you know, hearing at, you know, whenever we meet, you know, different clients, they were like, okay, what about vectors? Obviously, we're consultants, people look up to us, you know, for advises.
Like, is it something for me? Is it something that I can do? Is it something that, you know, we should go for, and, you know, I am a person again, I said, because I have something that really stops me if I have to lie. So, I mean, I would usually, you know, keep mum.
I would not really say something and I don't want to be in that situation for too long, because obviously the word is still, you know, getting ahead of themselves.
They are, you know, developing new solutions every day and then Chad GPD came and then, I mean, already a buzz about transformers and like LLM's, I think it's just non-stop. And everything is, you know, kind of, you know, like the boundaries are diminishing.
So, I remember like last year when I started with open source connections and Gen, in fact, I got a chance to work with this client and they were like, all about, you know, West Spa and then we also considered working with VVA8 and then what do you suggest? Like, are we making a good choice?
I mean, is it something that we should be doing? And at that point in time, I was like, literally, like, okay, I think I don't know, I don't have enough context of this.
And I think that's where it all started.
 I mean, that presentation I gave at Perlin Buzzwords last year about West Spa, it was condensed version of how I learned Westpiant, how I got completely, you know, I mean, it swidled me off my floor like there is something that existed, you know, at the time when it's so existed and it has been as solid as, you know, rest of the other traditional search engines as well as, you know, so many, you know, data science functionality that it offers.
So it was amazing. And I would say like, sometimes that imposter syndrome that, you know, women have, you know, it also, you know, like transforms or it's something that triggers us to do something that in the end, comes out as, you know, more like shining or grooming us. And I think I liked it.
So I think that's where it all started. And I think I proposed that idea to some of the folks at OSE that this is what I want to do.
It took some time, of course, because I was on the full-time engagements with the clients, but when I had like the first, you know, stop, I tried to make some things work. I experimented with stuff and that's what we came up with.
So, Rene really helped me with the, because I gave like initial demos to him and Eric and Charlie. And I said like, you know, I'm struggling with that the embedding needs to be calculated somehow.
I mean, solar already supports vectors, but the only challenges that, you know, the vectors for the query need to be somehow calculated, you know, outside of solar. And that's when you know, Rene suggested like it would be a good idea to maybe, you know, use Quirky for it.
And I have not worked on Quirky before. And I have been wanting to do that. Somehow none of my clients were really at that stage that they could use Quirky. And that's how I got to, you know, touch the entire stack of open source connections.
I have already contributed on QPIT before, like adding visualizations and the other stuff. Solved a lot of bugs. I think Eric would really help you for that. And I would hate you. Why would you hate for that? I mean, because it was, it was something like, I don't know, like some sort of a charm.
Like every time I would touch QPIT for some client requirement, I would find a bug. And then I think it's been very nice, I think in principle that he's person that who would say like, oh, there's a bug. Please lock the bug.
How about I offer you to work on it? I mean, it would initially feel like because I recorded it, but actually, I mean, if you see at that, I mean, it would actually come as a, you know, very empowering thing. Like he offers you to, you know, solve it the way you like.
And I think not many people are as open. Yeah. And if you turn it around like for him to know all the context details is super hard because you encountered it in very specific context and you have all the input to reproduce it, right? So you are the expert of that bug. That is true.
I think that's another way to look at it. I mean, I never thought of that in that aspect. But yes, that's that's true. So that's something that triggered me to work on QPIT. So I worked on several bugs before I added visualisation.
And that to came through because I had to otherwise, you know, do the visualisation outside of QPIT, and I would then complain like, how about, I mean, I'm anyway using data from QPIT.
How is it like, you know, if I could use the data that's coming from QPIT, like insight QPIT somehow, you know, supporting the visualisation as well. And I think it was certainly groundbreaking that we added Python notebooks functionality to QPIT.
And that just opened up a whole lot of, you know, the AI portal. Yeah, that's amazing actually because I also kept pushing QPIT in every job that I took, right? And not necessarily pushing as in I am selling the tool and I don't care what's the purpose for using it.
But I just know that for all these typical problems with search quality, instead of like reinventing a wheel, why not take an open source, you know, tool, like QPIT. And it's commercially friendly license, you know, go ahead, deploy it. It's very easy to do so. Exactly.
And then when I saw the, the notebooks, I was like, wow, this is so cool. I can just now select to my data scientists and say, hey, we've just labeled all this queries. Can you do your magic right here in the notebook? And I can actually access it as well, potentially, or whatever.
I mean, it's just like so much easier than to scratch your head and think, okay, now I need to download all this data, all these annotations, and then push them somewhere else. And then, yeah, it's, I think it's an amazing feature. Thanks for doing it. Oh, my pleasure. Yeah.
So I think also during this course of discussion, we also discovered some documentation bugs, something that we're not mentioned in solar documentation. I contributed to that too.
So I would say like in principle, I think we have a very supportive and encouraging culture in the company, which is what I really like. I think, I don't know, maybe if I could talk a little more about this wet room implementation. I mean, there have been several talks about it as well.
I also presented that, you know, Craco, the haystack on tour. But I think it was something that was, you know, has been sitting on my mind for too long, because I think we need a, you know, reasonable way to not, you know, like, you know, detain the question from the client.
And also, at the same time, we want to address the question in most, you know, like explainable way. And I think this was like the explainable thing that, you know, is something that people can use.
And I think all this while, you know, people have been discussing about vectors, I think people charged money to show you that, you know, vectors could work in your search engine. And we do it for free.
And I think, again, going by like what my company does, like we provide a lot of informational content, you know, for free and open source, lots and lots of things, you know, which usually would cost a lot of money to the companies.
And I think this is something I really feel like I'm doing a good job. I'm making a difference. So I think that that really brings a lot of, you know, like satisfaction that I'm doing a good job somewhere. So that's, that's nice.
And I think now I'm working on to also, you know, experiment with other stuff with the selector thing. I presented that, you know, we would be working on improving the image models.
So basically, I mean, I'm sure you know about it, but for some viewers, it would be a new thing that chorus is a dummy shop. And we have a dataset that comes from icecat. So icecat data basically is, you know, like a collaborated content from Amazon and other, you know, web shops.
And usually that content is like very, very structured content. It has images as well. And Lord, if you know, my new features or attributes of all the products. So which is why it's like a good example.
Plus we have other content as well in the chorus in general, like how Quepid would work locally for your web shop and how you can use quirky and smooie to do the search andizing part and, you know, manage these search rules.
Like if you want to bring some brand up in the search results, you could do that as well. So I think we promised that we would be working on the images side. And because we have access to images, usually we have any commerce shops. So we tried to, you know, leverage that as well.
And I think if you look at the demos that we presented, even without fine tuning the results were like breathtakingly unbelievable. We were like, wow, this is, this is amazing.
So I think in general, I think it was very, you know, liberating experience that, you know, we could use vectors successfully in these shops, which are using the traditional search engines. So we, I recently also contributed the last search version.
Because again, in lot of forms, when we posted about vectors in solar and chorus solar version, we got a lot of questions about like, is it going to be supported also in last search? So I think I just took stab at that too. And chorus is implemented in which language? Is it Java or? Yes.
So chorus is, yes, it's combination, of course. I think I'm adding a lot of, you know, I think content to it as well.
I think one of the more interesting things that I also contributed and I felt like it's something that usually people would not share it on the open source is like how you can convert your documents into vectors.
So I think this is the part that usually, you know, the data encoding process, something that people would really charge you high amount of money to, you know, add vectors into your indexing pipeline. And I provide that again for free. Yeah. And in solar version.
So I think that is also something that people could take advantage of. Yeah, I mean, just a couple of years ago, when was it exactly a year ago? Eric, you traveled to Europe to meet you guys in Berlin and then he also traveled to Finland to visit me.
And he wasn't the hotel room and he said, hey, let's work for a few hours. And he was actually asking some questions about vector search. We were writing this article in search insights, right? Oh, right. Right. And and and he was saying his very passion, he's like almost theatrical.
He was like walking in the room and saying, okay, here is the pipeline. I have solar. I have this. I have my Java like client. So where will you compute this vectors if all the models are accessible through Python, right? Yeah.
And it wasn't just a question of you might get the same question with your client, but it was like, wait a second. Do I even know myself? What would I do? And I said, probably I don't. So I would start engineering something from scratch. That is true.
And I think that that is that is actually one of the most obvious questions that keeps coming across because Lord of our clients are now interested in this.
I mean, I know a typical work week for me has been like, I'm giving like more than four or five demos in a week to clients like who want to know about this like will it fit my use case? Like I have this, you know, size of the catalog like will it fit my use case? What do I need?
And what kind of models? I mean, I need to choose and obviously there are some things that we need to also, you know, spend time and, you know, charge money for.
But then eventually it turns out that, you know, people bring in their concerns and that basically, you know, like shapes, what is it that we need to contribute next to the open source? What is it that is confusing people? Why people are creating so much hype about this stuff?
Like this needs to be demystified.
And I think that's what my company does the best. And I think I'm just learning from them. Yeah, I think it's the it's an excellent spot. And it's like, usually with all these hypes, things get overcomplicated. But in the end, if they prove to to exist, right, it prove the right to exist.
Then I think many of these things will get simplified. They will probably to some extent even commoditize. And like, I think it was the recent LinkedIn post that, broken up every single mind and search by Dr. Dr.
and Bullway, he says, you know, why what's happening with the last search? What's happening with solar? What's happening with this? That's right. Lodge language models. And, you know, like, and it's like, how do so many people chip in? And I was wondering them too. Yes.
And they are still like revolving around like some of the some more interesting concepts, some more like basic concepts that really are unsolved in many ways.
And, you know, how do you even like deliver vectors to your database and so on and so forth?
And one of the comments, I don't remember who said it was, hey, you know, in the end, keyword search and vector search, both will be as equal kind of like, modesty that you can play with in any order, probably give some weightage to one or another depending on your use case.
And so complexity will shift away from these basic topics to something more domain specific. That is actually right. And I'm glad you pointed out.
And this was something that that's been like constantly asked when we present, when we give demos that, you know, how do I fit this into my existing stack? I know it's cool. And because when we say that, you know, it is understanding the semantic meaning of your query.
And that means that even if the things which are not described in the similar vocabulary, then also your search engine can find them. So I think which is a very powerful thing if you look at. And also there are some people who really wanted to use all the machine learning magic.
I mean, I remember the craze in 2017 when LTR came out like how many people really wanted to use LTR? And then it was like, you know, that kind of gave a lot of struggle to a lot of folks. So it's just that how easily accessible, you know, machine learning models now become.
So people need to know, people deserve to know that it is not that rocket science anymore. Like it is very common. It's very obvious. It's like the natural path that should go into. And the thing that I wanted to point out earlier was that the hybrid is the wave forward.
There are so many things that I could think of that keyword does the best. And I think sooner people realize that hybrid is the way forward. Yeah.
And like what is your take on hybrid if you were to offer it to a client, you know, I have heard from some of the clients in the past, you know, okay, so if we have a vector database, like VVAT or pinecon or whatever or quadrant.
And then we have the needs for the e-commerce application like facets and we cannot do it in some of these databases. So what should we do? Like does hybrid mean that we will run to databases like one elastic search, one vector database, or do you have a better answer to that? I think not really.
I think that's also an interesting point if it's coming in the discussion here. I think sooner or lot of these, you know, vector database and vector search engine companies are also realizing that they cannot lose what keyword search engines brought. They cannot just take it away.
I think one of the other things that, you know, the keyword based search engines abroad is like, you have total control on what goes into the search engine. And I think this is something in the name of semantic understanding, you cannot just push your content into these search engines.
So you still have to massage the content, you still have to treat it, you still have to have control on this data. And somehow, like if you say that, you know, synonyms are not needed anymore because, you know, the vector search engines, you know, would understand all of that.
But what about stemming? What about, you know, there are tons of other things that we do in the before pointing data into the search engine. And I think that still stays relevant in a lot of different contexts because this has developed, this has grown over the period of time.
You cannot throw it all out.
So I feel like there's a, you know, mid kind of point that, you know, we have to come, like, especially for the traditional search engines and the new search engines, which are emerging in the market, they have to come somewhere in between, where we try to, you know, bring best of both words.
And I think that is going to be the way forward. Yeah, but I guess we are not kind of like there yet, right? I would say like, I mean, the change has already started. All right.
In the presentations that we give and the demonstrations that we provide to the customers, I think people ask us that, you know, what is the smallest use case I could, you know, try with this.
So I think one of the suggestions that always, you know, comes from my side is that, you know, attack the cases that do not, you know, perform well with your traditional search engine. So for example, like the long tail queries, I think this is where any traditional search engine struggles.
This is probably the first thing, and instead of, you know, running into a zero head screen, like it is better to, you know, have a chain sort of, which should delegate your query to the vector search engine or a vector part of the query.
And this is something should be like a smallest, you know, like way to adopt the the newest technologies and take leverage what they find a bring it.
So maybe like from the product perspective and business perspective, reducing the search abandonment rate, right? Because that, that that what actually takes a lot of money away from all these players, you know, absolutely.
The abandonment you're just based, based off and you're like, you cannot find anything. So why should I keep trying? The system does not even like respond. Absolutely.
I mean, I have been in that situation before because I've also worked on like a lot of product searches and I would leverage something like, you know, I would keep on doing like the relaxation of the tokens in the query. So I would keep dropping the content that doesn't make sense.
But then I would say it's not the easiest thing to do. Rather, it is easier to pass on this query, like the long query to another system that is, you know, dealing with semantic similarity. And once that has proven its worth, I think that's the time we bring it forward.
And we take it more like from the down to up approach. Yeah. So you think the message really to vector database companies is to think about what you can take from keyword search engines like solar elastic search, open search, I guess as well, right? Absolutely.
And also message to the existing keyword search engine companies as well as that you're not old fashioned, you're not like out of the market anyway, like you have proven your worth over the period of time and it is here to stay. It's just that how quickly you can adopt to the change.
And I think that is happening. Yeah. Yeah. That's very interesting. I think you you are calming many people. No, I like, oh, I'm like, I will losing, I will losing the wave of innovation because we cannot, you know, introduce vector database into the mix or whatever.
But I think you can, right? Like with solar, Alexander Benedetti is doing a lot of work in implementing the vector search there. And then in the elastic search, of course, solar Maria Shripe and others have been Julie. Yes.
Julie Tsipzirani have been doing work there, right? But like I do still feel like what Doug was saying in his post, you know, the cracks of it that like it doesn't feel like this functionality is advertised well. I think that's actually the point. Yes.
And of it, not even from the marketing perspective, but more like from the perspective of, hey, how do you get things done with this? Yeah. Like all these basic questions answered. Yeah. I think that's actually a very good point.
I think and there's a way, I would say like a contrast you see here, because the companies which are bringing the vector search in a database of the search engine format, they're new. They're upcoming in the market. I think this is part of the marketing strategy that they have to talk about it.
They have to advertise it. It's just that, you know, the traditional search engine companies or I would not say like solar is not with your company. Elastic probably is.
But then because they are already, you know, like very popular people are using it, they don't need that mass, you know, publicity.
So to say, but I think we need to talk about it that, okay, I think if that's a trend, like we do it too, but we don't talk about it that much as much as we should be doing.
And I think that's actually an interesting point, which means that we should talk about course more, because I think that basically exemplifies as to how easily can this be done with your search engine.
So you don't have to divorce your existing search engine to use some cool technology, unless you really have a case where you are starting right up from the scratch. I think you can consider using one of these.
Otherwise, I think if you're using something already, which has grown over the period of time, it doesn't make sense to throw everything out of the window just yet. Absolutely.
And with your Lucine mindset, what have you seen in Vespa that looked attractive for that? Yeah, I think I have been quite a Vespa fan girl, I would say more for the reasons that the content, the kind of content that Vespa, he generates.
 I think, you know, you would need, when you're talking about features, when you're talking about, you know, search engine or, you know, different kind of like what can be enabled with this feature, you all, you know, think about like, okay, will it perform like how much of queer response time am I looking at?
What is the data set I'm looking at? And when you look at like the Vespa's content, I mean, you don't have to look any further, like everything is summarized so well.
I think this one thing I'm trying to, you know, add to my writing style that I assess everything, well, that I can say it out loud to the public, to the word that, you know, this is how it performs.
And I think the very knowledgeable folks, I mean, especially Joe, I think I have been super impressed with how he describes stuff. And I think some of the things have really like blown my mind out as well, like, oh, this could be done in this way as well. I think that's that's one of the things.
And while developing this presentation last year, I think I bugged him a lot. But if he was, he was always, always super responsive, even his team, there were some, you know, UI things that I found out, like we're not working as expected.
And I think they're always, you know, very modest and, you know, acknowledging that, okay, this is something that will work on. And this is how it works.
So they're always there somehow, like, I don't know how big the team is, they're always, you know, some familiar faces who are always responding to your messages, but it's nice.
One of the other things that I would like to point out is also that, I mean, distinct or I would say like a nice thing, is that updates is one thing that, you know, you would struggle with in a search engine.
If you have big catalog and you're expecting, especially like in e-commerce, like, updates come in, the company that I used to work for before, we used to have several updates and we used to club them out, kind of bashing process.
And we would process them just as like together, because we didn't really have resources to process them, like one by one or just as how they come. I think Westphah really does that, like through updates, through atomic updates is something, through partial updates, sorry, is what they do.
And I think this is something really, really cool. And I think that just takes away that need, that you need to rein next everything and sometimes, you know, people complain that I have a really big catalog and it takes like six hours.
If I rein next everything, I think that's something they clearly stand out. I think when they say when they claim that we are searching for big data, I think they really get it done. Yeah. And I think it was also proven in the context of Yahoo systems, right? Some of the life scavenants. Yeah.
I mean, they're always the early adopters and I think the way they write about this stuff and how they implement, I think they correlate, you know, cover the topic when they're talking about it or implementing it. And I think that's what I really like about them. Yeah.
So like if you would recommend someone who starts from scratch, would you recommend Westphah? I think I can. I think I can. I think, you know, one of the things, maybe I'm old fashioned or I don't know, like this, this is not affiliated way. I mean, no one has really paid me to say this.
But more of like, I feel like it's not as fragile as so many systems that are coming up recently. I mean, obviously we have more sourcing power. We are ways stronger infrastructure wise. But I think it is as solid as, you know, so do our elastic is. I think the kind of trust I have in them.
And also like as, you know, clearly catching up to the trend and, you know, evolving soon is also what they have. So I think that's that's really kind of something remarkable. And like to think, I mean, it's a huge pallet of systems. And it's not like one of one is the only winner here.
Like it would think it would think about, you know, Luzin itself, which has been developed for like how many years 20? Yeah. Or more actually. It has so many human languages. Natural languages support it that you cannot find probably in West Boa or other systems.
But again, it all depends on your market where you're going. If it's English speaking, probably you'll be fine. But like if it's like Japanese or, you know, some of the interesting tokenizers that have been contributed to Luzin, I probably still stand out.
Yeah, I think that's one good point that how much of control or where exactly am I coming from? I think a lot depends on the context too. That is, that is right. I mean, I would. Yeah. And like switching gears a bit. So we did touch on this topic.
But like, so your progression and the profession has been from, you know, what sounds to me like, I don't know, it's the super tough competition to go from to for 100,000 people to 100 something like that. It's just insane. It just feels like, you know, a journey full of challenge.
But then like on top of these, there could be other challenges that, I don't know, like gender inequality or whatever is happening in the world today, right? In the profession.
And this was one of the topics that really stood out on Haystack in Berlin last year, in September, right? Where you ran the session, women in search, if I remember correctly, the title. And you had some women in search invited on stage.
And some of them have sent, but here, recorded, um, little presentations. I mean, this was very like emotional. It was, it was a learning experience for many. The crowd was speechless in some sense, uploading, of course.
What was going through your mind when you were preparing this session? How did you come up with this idea? I think, I mean, I would also acknowledge like, when people raise hands after this session, I was expecting like, oh my god, what kind of questions?
Like, people would start asking me, like, you know, how did you come up with this? Like, how did you come to this figure and stuff? And they would ask me questions about what I presented.
But it was absolutely so hot warming to see that each one of the people who raised hands were to appreciate and tell me how they felt about this session and not really like putting me on the spot.
And I think one of the other things that I wanted to achieve, because we've had the first session of women in search in Haystack, US last year. So Haystack is just from the corner while we're talking about this or might have happened when we roll this out.
But yeah, I think Audrey presented the first women in search session in US. And it was a panel discussion as to what women really expect in the company or what kind of qualities or what kind of features they, you know, stand out for women when they decide to join a company.
And it was our long conversation. I think there were different kind of feedback. Some people enjoyed it. Some people said, like, oh my god, it was kind of like too much to sit in one place and listen to like white women talking.
So I think the idea came from the point that I would not, you know, have like a panel discussion. It has to be something different. And it has to be something solid. It has to be something that people can relate to. And it has to be something that is contributed by several women.
 So I cannot bring everyone up on the stage of course, but I wanted to make sure like I have as many women as possible somehow to talk about themselves because each time I speak to, you know, fellow women in the search of crowd, I feel like they, they very much, you know, underplay what contributions they make.
And I think this is something I keep telling, you know, people that I meet that, you know, what you're doing is amazing. It's just that if the other person failing to see what you've done, it's not that you've done, you've not done anything less.
And I think this is basically the message that I wanted to kind of, you know, spread across that, you know, if you're not seen enough, I mean, maybe we just need to gather, you know, like we as women and we would be there to support each other.
We would be there to kind of, you know, advocate for each other. We would be there to mentor and collaborate with each other. If, and I also said this in the session, that one thing that always, you know, like surprised me is that men form group to kind of groom themselves to develop themselves.
Women just don't do that. I don't know why women are often, you know, like in their heads, they're still competing with each other because it's like, okay, only one could be misuniverse. Only, you know, one of you can be succeeded.
There's always like, you know, one best thing and that basically, you know, triggers this competitive nature in us. And I think that needs to really go away. Like, and people do it, people make us compete.
And I think this is something that somehow, you know, I'm trying to, you know, like spread across that there's no point competing.
Let us, you know, use each other's, you know, strength to become, you know, one solid strength so that, you know, we can really, like, become a better version of ourselves. So we're not competing with each other. We are, you know, we have to act as one.
So that's, I hope that that message kind of spreads across. And I hate when companies say is like, you know, we have rolled out this position. And we're expecting like 33% applications from women. Like, we never do that for men.
Like, we never say out the numbers that, you know, like these much of our, you know, applications came from men. Like, why we have to always, you know, explicitly talk about this number. Like, we have reservations. We don't need reservations. We need, like, we need to be equally considered.
And I think there have been like several sessions. And I think when you talked about the preparation, I think I literally soaked into that moment, you know, became one of like the activists myself. I was attending so many different kind of webinars and like the in-person sessions.
I don't know how many tons of like groups that I join afterwards to listen to like what people really talk about. And I think this is like way specific or critical to me because I want to make sure like I deliver my 100% when I'm doing something even though if it is non-technical.
So although I was like very skeptical about like if I should do something non-technical because I think in my head I was still replaying that I don't want to be type-casted as like, oh, maybe she's not that technical. That's why she's talking about, you know, non-text stuff.
So it was kind of like I was confused like if I should do that. I mean, I don't want to be type-casted. But in the end I was very happy, very surprised, happy, surprised that people took it well. People took it the way I expected them to take it. And a lot of women reach out to me as well.
A lot of companies reach out to me as well. And it's surprising that how many people want to collaborate and you know they tag me on several, you know, LinkedIn posts as well when people make big claims.
And that gives me an opportunity to speak to different companies as to, you know, what are they doing? And what is it that they want to do? And sometimes people expect that you know, I would be coaching like how can they add diversity, how they can bring in more women in the team.
And I'm like, okay, I can help you with your, you know, search application. Not maybe this is not probably what I master. But it's nice. I think how many people kind of want to be involved with this venture. There's this company that I recently spoke to. I would not name them.
I would present them maybe in Haystack EU who have got so convinced. And even the CEO of the company got so convinced that they introduced like supporting women and having women in presence in their company as like one of the pillars pillars of the company. Like this is what we are defending.
This is what we are going to be talking about. So which was very hot warming. People sent me messages like, Oh, after your session, you know, we added like two or three women to our team. I think in next six months time, we would let you know how this goes.
So it's very warming to know, like people are trusting me, people are, you know, like reacting to it very positively. People are not, you know, typecasting me. And that's, I mean, it feels, you know, like I feel accountable for rest of the women as well.
So I feel like if I mean, I can somehow, you know, bring more of women together and like the problem that they have, they do not have means to network even though we are so much of advanced word. Like some way we could mentor women.
I think if you remember, like the women that came up on the stage, they were not speaking up that nicely as well. I mean, they were not groomed in the in the manner that, you know, some of them were really shaking.
And some of these women, you know, wanted to, they were feeling more comfortable to speak, like in a recorded video in the closed room. And I think that's where it was coming from. Some of them were obviously coming from another place altogether, last minute editions as well.
So obviously they could not manage to travel. But most of them had this fear that they were like, you know, we would introduce ourselves in one line. And I was like, yeah, I mean, one line, two line, three line, just come up on the stage.
Like, let's just, you know, feel that, you know, light up the stage, like how does it really feels like? So, and if you, you were there in the session as well, like none of the contributions they mentioned were less in any way. It's just that we don't realize the, that how big our contribution is.
I was blown literally like, I think I even made the comment there. I don't remember the name of the lady, but she was saying, hey, I was just like a student. And then I found an internship in one company and I started contributing to solar and my code was accepted. Yeah. And she was exactly.
She was still, like doubtful of herself. Like, am I going, what is this? Is this the right thing? Yeah.
And I was like, I remember myself, when 2010, 11, 12, something like that, I came up with some ideas, some code, and I was kind of thinking, what if I contributed something to solar? And I failed. I could never like find my, myself a path there.
And then at some point, I kind of like gave up in a way. And you know, like, and then this lady says, hey, I just did this small thing, right? And clearly underselling it. And by the way, yeah, that's true.
And by the way, I mean, if she's listening or someone else is listening, I have used peramsat in the vector implementation as well. There you go.
Yeah, I have tried to include all the bits and pieces like, you know, I mean, I'm always, you know, touched by this open source, you know, contribution part. I feel like that gives you the opportunity that you can learn from experienced people.
And it takes effort to accept the feedback from such a large audience, so many experienced people. It gives the opportunity to interact and have, you know, like comments from people who've been working in the industry for such a long time.
And if you survive like one contribution, even one contribution, I think that's where it starts. And something like, you know, it's like some addiction. Like once you start it, it's like, you don't, you just keep one of, do it like every, in every possible way.
You just want to make sure like you're contributing something or the other. It's so amazing. It feels amazing. Yeah, exactly.
And it's nice to say this because I hope that there will be more female listeners also joining this podcast, according to my statistics, at least, you know, there've been domination of male listeners if YouTube is not lying to me. But I don't think that should continue that way, for sure.
Because this world is much more diverse, much more interesting, and also we should remember to say that in the relevance and matching text lack, there is a secret group, right? Can you say something about that? Like a channel? You mean women and source group? It's open.
I mean, it's open to women and the allies. So if you consider yourself as a ally for women in search, you're welcome to join it. There is no secret. You can be happily part of it. And we have session one some month every first Wednesday. And we still have that.
We are trying to bring in more useful content. So I talked about like mentoring part and the, you know, collaborating part. And then how I'm seeing that, you know, women should contribute and, you know, collaborate more.
So I'm trying to have a pattern where we could have some text sessions as well. Like I imagine, I think two, two months ago, I think, because from last two, I have not been able to attend myself one when I was out of town and the other one, I think I was not well. So I did not attend them.
But then what I'm trying to have here is that we are trying to have more like text sessions, more like people open up to themselves and then, you know, to the others that this is what I'm trying to achieve.
So I think the session that I had like two months ago, I was still implementing stuff up in course.
I was still kind of battling with like, how do I make images work?
And I was considering and it was so beautiful that during that call, like everyone who was, you know, just kind of, you know, getting to know each other and it's nice that, you know, every time we have a meeting, at least one or two new people join in.
So one of them said, like, have you tried this? Have you tried that? And everyone got there, you know, Jupiter notebooks out and then they all started, you know, like, oh, this is going to work. Oh, maybe this one needs a licensing cost.
Oh, maybe this one we should not consider because it supports these many things only. And then by that time that one hour, I mean, became so productive that everyone left that meeting with some knowledge of vectors. And it was so amazing to see that. That's super cool.
I mean, I'm really glad to hear this because it both connects to like an overarching goal, some real purpose here. And also, you know, you create the environment of support and exchange and cross-pollination. I think this is something that men should do too.
Yeah, you're welcome to join the sessions. I mean, this is really, I mean, we feel, I mean, it's really nice. And I can say, like, you have good reputation. People would love to have you.
We hosted a Sebastian from Weaviate who offered to help after the Haystack EU session to help women to, you know, have some public speaking skills. And I think we've had an amazing session. We did not put that out on YouTube yet.
Not sure why, but then people who attended absolutely hanged us and said, like, it was really useful. Some planning to have more sessions like that. Maybe we could host you someday as well. That would be awesome for sure. And so you have a YouTube for that. Or is it part of Oh, we have it.
I think this is the reason why it was not put on YouTube because we don't really have a channel. And we did not know like where should we put it. But we recorded it for sure. We have the recording. Yeah, I think today YouTube is one of the probably defective platforms.
I don't want to over-advertise it, but I think it's a good place to be. Yeah, I think that's a good suggestion, I think, will certainly consider for that in future as well. But yeah, I think the entire idea is that, you know, we need to make a positive impact.
Be it with open source, be it with, you know, the trying to push and bring up more minority people up front.
One of the most, I think one of the things that I would like to highlight here is also maybe we haven't touched, but while talking, it strikes me that we have a saying back in India that behind every successful man, there is a woman.
I think it kind of, you know, reverses itself in my case because my story started. I mean, if I talk about from my college, my husband is also my, was my classmate. So I'm like one of those blessed people who has a company of someone who always supports me.
And I think I have been here always, you know, bold and like standing on the stage giving presentations because behind that is the person who is, you know, very meek, very nervous. Like, how would I do it? And he's the one who's always encouraging me to come up on these stage and like, I can do it.
So it's interesting that behind me and every, you know, big stake that I took, there was always a man. So if I talk about like the first one started with my husband, the next one was obviously my manager at my first job.
And with the open source as well, I would like to mention that there's search engine that's probably not very popular. Maybe a lot of people do not even know about it, open source server. And it's not affiliated with AWS open search in any way. But so this guy has recommended me also on LinkedIn.
And we bumped into like maybe he was trying out, you know, other contributors or developers as well for his search engine. And we collaborated and he showed me whole new word of open source, open source contributions.
So he's a very critical person, I would say like code wise, I think he's really good. And he worships, I would say Mike McIndels, because every time I would not understand anything and Lucy and he would show me something from my McIndels. So I mean, it was, it was nice.
And then I started, I think if I talk about from the open source connection, affiliated libraries as well. So chorus was mostly like Eric and Renee kind of pushed me into like we should do something together, keep it again.
Eric promoted sort of that, you should try fixing some things also with solar. It was Eric. And with open NLP, it was one of my colleagues at open source connections, who's not with open source connections anymore. So Jeff, who is chair of the open NLP library.
So I think there was this discussion we had because we were trying to work on a use case together. And he suggested like we could do this with open NLP. And I was using an open NLP before as well, like in 2017.
And somehow never really thought of like I would contribute, but I pointed out to him that you know there's something that could be done in this direction. And he said like why don't you do it? And I was like me like no way. And he was like no, no, you can do it.
I mean, if you understand this, I mean certainly. And I think as I said before, like it's an addiction, once you started, you just don't want to stop. And I think that's how I started, I mean, I started using it more and more contributing more and obviously.
And you became the commuter as well, right? I became the comatir. Yes. Of open NLP, right? Congratulations. That's really great. You're right. Nice. Actually nice. And the kind of people who review your code and like you get to know like oh, this could be done this way as well.
I mean, I can say that it's a very rounded development opportunity that I got with open source, open source contributions. So that's something I can highly, highly recommend anyone.
I think one of the things that has really helped me in principle is like starting with the documentation or maybe the test cases. I think that's very classic advice that you would get from anyone who's been working and contributing. But that's really the right way to go about it.
I think documentation really helps because you can not just write anything like that. You have to try things out yourself before writing about them. And I think that just gives you enough context to pick up some tickets and like start solving them.
I am actually mentoring some of the people like outside my job to contribute on open source. And just so you know, these are the people who have been in the industry for like 20, 25 years.
So I mean, there are people who come with Lord of hesitation that I mean, is it even something that I should do? But it's nice. I mean, the kind of questions they bring in and the kind of discussions we have. It's amazing. So yeah.
Yeah, I mean, for sure, like what you said, makes so much sense, you know, like you read the docs, you will and you will test it out probably as part of your job or of your research project or whatever or your curiosity, right? And something will definitely not be right.
I mean, whatever said in the doc is not longer true or it doesn't apply for use case.
But how did you you said, you know, this imposter syndrome and like just general fear or like you didn't have experience with it? How did you kind of leap from from what you just encountered that doesn't work to actually going and contributing it? I think that that is something.
I mean, I've so I think the first time it took kind of the bigger leap of faith, then rest of the other times. I think once it works, that's what I'm saying. Like the first time is always going to be the hardest.
I think you would always and I think not being able to contribute on solar for almost like six years, I have been away from solar and I can say like a lot of things I already implemented when they came out in solar for point 10, I think that's what I started working on in 2012 or 14.
And it was kind of this grudge that really like made me feel and took me on a guilt trip that I could have done that just that I did not have a knowledge of. So which is which is why I mean, I'm saying that if you think about that you could do it, I mean, just think about the worst thing.
Worst is that somebody would reject and ask you to rework on it. But from your side, you would have the satisfaction that I thought this could be done this way and I tried to you know, do it this way. And I think that's what that's how I am living now.
I mean, if I have something on my mind, sitting on my mind that this is how it should be done, I just execute it because that is what is in my control. Like I can execute it. Approving or not approving something is something that I delegate to the rest, the other person.
So I think that is also something that we brought up in the discussion with Sebastian that Lord of Women, when discussing like how can we become like better public speakers, asked him that you know, what is a good topic to be submitted in the conference?
Like how do I ensure like my topic is accepted? And he made a way, I would say like a reasonable advice that from your side, what you can do is like submit the proposal.
I mean, accepting, not accepting is something, I mean, once it is you know, like submitted, it goes to the next swimling and that's when you stop thinking about it.
If it comes back to you, that's when you need to think about like what do I need to present to woo the crowd and making sure like you make a point. But then that's what even I do. Like if I think about that, this is how it should be done, I just do it. I like maxes like it would be rejected.
It would not be accepted or somebody would say like, oh, you know what, this is wrong. This is now hot. This is not how it should be done. That's about it. You get a feedback. Either you get the recognition of the stuff that you've contributed or you get feedback. Both of them are good.
Yeah, that's beautifully put. I remember about one person who was like a Java champion. I don't know if you know of this title that was awarded at some point by some microsystems. I think it's called Java champion.
You know, people who really popularized Java and you know, talked about it, written books and contributed code and so on and so forth.
 And he was saying, you know, whenever he received the question and he had like 20, 25 years experience in this and he was saying, hey, when I hear a question from a newcomer, doubting themselves million, million of times, you know, should I apply for this job or should I become, should I commit something here like code or whatever.
I am just afraid. He was saying, okay, go and get your rejection. So it's like that first leap that you take and it becomes bit more like a game. I mean, it's like and he had a bit of like humor here, right? Okay.
So you're doubting yourself, you think you will get rejected, then prove it, go and get it. Right. And as they go and get it, they will probably either get it or succeed or get some partial you know, stage and to the partial stage and probably need to revise something and so on to right. Right.
No, that is that is amazing. I mean, I love it. And I that also brings back like I used to have this email signature. I think in during the time when I was in college that I never lose either when or I learn. Yeah. That just brought back. I mean, I don't know.
I at what point in time like I removed it, but I really lived by that line that you either learn or you win. So either way, it's a win. Yeah.
And like, probably getting ahead of ourselves, but like even when you start getting these small wins, they have start and end really like by the end of the win, you're like, okay, what should they do next?
You know, next challenge for me, you know, and that's probably you already had of yourself and you're doing a lot of work already, but at the same time, that challenge is always there.
And that's the part of the game and part of the reinforcement learning. And that is actually the correct terminology. I was just looking for that term. I think reenforcement learning is I think that's exactly how it happens. I think for me, it's exactly how it's going.
Like I contribute something, then I get feedback and I present it. And I think I start, you know, becoming more kind of like passionate about the other stuff. So it's like, you know, throwing your hat over the wall. And the next time you throw it at, I mean, throw your hat at even higher wall.
So I'm not sure if you understand that terminology, like this is something that's like taking your chances. So it's like throwing hat over the wall. So yeah, that's that's so I'm trying to make sure like all the feedback that I got from demos and the presentations that I give so far.
I mean, I, you know, collect all of it, making sure like I address everything. I have big presentation again at Berlin Buzzwords to give this year. Yeah, I think it's kind of like something.
If I look back, like the first time when I spoke at Berlin Buzzword and I think year 2020, then that's when the conference was like online. It was something I remember that, I mean, I went to my office because my kids would disturb me.
And I have this, you know, like I was so nervous, I had like five bottles of water next to me. And then I did not drink anything because I felt like I would not have to leave the seat for the toilet break if I drink that that much water.
So I was so confused like, I'm thirsty because I'm talking so much, but then I would not drink them because I would have to, you know, go away because I was hosting the lightning talk session, which went on for like the longer than a usual talk session.
So it was, it was like from that point in time until now, I think, yes, it's been quite a journey. Yeah, amazing.
I mean, this, this is really like coming to this logical question that I usually ask, like the question of why, and like you shared a lot today, you know, about women and search, your own journey, public speaking.
And there is always something new coming up, new projects, new blog, as a result of that project, maybe new struggle, new learning and so on.
But is there something that keeps you in this profession beyond these challenges, beyond solutions? Or is it just that? I think it's mostly, I don't know, it's, it's something so engaging and the joy that I get in solving things, I think that just keeps me going on and on.
And I think it's also like a commitment that I have to myself that learning things and experimenting with stuff that really brings the best out of me. So I mean, I have this somehow ambition, I want to be, you know, like I want to know everything and maybe language analysis.
I mean that, you know, so much, you know, has like a passion that I have for these that I want to be like a PhD someday in that. And which is why I want to know everything and somehow, like just aiming for that goal, I know I'm like maybe old, old for doing PhD.
But yeah, that's the goal, like keep for myself. Like if I, I think a short story before we end is that people ask me like, what does your name means? And I think if you're not noticed, like my name is a pellandrom, my first name and my last name.
So it's a, the ITA, and if you reverse it, it stays the same. Also people ask me like, what does it mean? So my name is actually a machine learning model. So I learn from the past. That's what my name means.
And I want to just, you know, prove my name that if my parents, you know, thought of something before naming me at the time, they get what they expected from me. And that's all about it. Oh, very beautiful answer. Really? It's like living to your, to your true self. Yes. Amazing.
Is there something you want to announce? Are you already said that you're going to present at Marine Bosworth's? Is there something else you want to share with the audience that they should know about? Maybe course or something, something that they should, you know, get them and start it with.
Oh, yeah, for sure. I think so the elastic search version of courses also out now. I mean, happy to take more questions. If you have anything, reach out to me on Slack, of course. Other than that, there were certain things that I wanted to rework. So we wanted to work on our image models.
So that's now been fixed already. So happy to give that try as well. Along with that, we're soon going to be sharing some more information about fine tuning the models. We're already working with Gina AI on that.
So hopefully we can come up with the blog post or something that demystifies that part as well. Other than that, I have some plans also for Hastag EU. I'm working on some case studies with the companies.
 I mean, if somebody who's listening to this podcast thinks that they could be one of the candidates who wants to be involved with this case study, we would talk about how involvement of women change things at your workplace, feel free to connect with me on relevance like or whichever way you think is the best LinkedIn.
Yeah, I bet Twitter maybe. Oh, yeah, Twitter for sure. Absolutely. Thanks for adding that in. Fantastic. I really, really enjoyed this conversation at TITA. I learned something today. And I think that our listeners did as well. Keep improving your model.
Keep generating more of the parts so you can further your model. And I hope to meet you as well at Hastag or some other meetup maybe online. And yeah, I mean, it was a really pleasure to talk to you today. Yeah, same here. It was amazing.
And I mean, it was obviously like a different level, like being a subscriber and being on the show. So that was the kind of like moment I had with myself today. Thank you for this opportunity. Thanks so much. It was also the best for the forthcoming podcasts. Yeah, thank you so much.
Thank you, TITA. Yeah, bye bye.
