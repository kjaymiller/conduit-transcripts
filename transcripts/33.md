From Relay FM, you're listening to Conduit, the show where we conduit our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show where the weather is partly cloudy with a chance of brain fog. This episode is brought to you by Hover and Masterclass.
I'm Kathy and with me my friend across the United States is Jay. Hey Jay. Hi, I'm only across the US for one more week. I'm going home on Saturday. Are you excited? I have a feeling you're very excited.
Words cannot describe how we'll feel to sit in my my chair with my computer and my mic to do all the things. That said, thank you so much Brad for letting me use your space for a month. That's very, very kind of you. Amazing. Yeah.
And how did you thank him? We're going to we can like that connection. We're going to we're going to leave that in there. Yeah. I spent money. I bought I helped him complete his his connection check by purchasing things that he was selling. Excellent. I can't wait to hear more about them.
Which in in our super secret text channel, I'm sure. But that we're no that's a connection check that we're not going to talk about. So instead we're going to go. Do you have any other shout outs? Jay. Yeah. Shout out to Moran's consignment in Chelsea Michigan.
The only place in Chelsea Michigan to buy men's pants. Kathy. I went to a wedding this weekend and the wedding was fantastic. But I'm from the southern part of the country where it's nice and comfortable year round. And I was in the northern part of the country, which is not that.
And I forgot to pack pants. So I just had shorts. And yeah, at a wedding rehearsal slash also dinner, you probably want to dress somewhat nicer than shorts and a D shirt. Oh no. You so like you I have so many questions. Yeah, so be too.
So I wound up going to on my way out there because it's about an hour away from the nearest airport. And then oh, yeah, sorry trousers for those that are international. I'm going to still use pants because it's a funny word America. Yeah, yeah.
So as I'm driving and I'm driving through small towns because that's what Michigan is is a network of small towns. I said, OK, I will stop and grab a pair of pants. And when I did, I stopped. And there was nowhere to buy pants in this town of Chelsea.
So eventually I was like, OK, I will either have to appear in shorts or I'm going to have to go into this one thrift store again, brands consignment in Chelsea Michigan.
So which I wonder how the surprise on the person manning the store or attending to the store was when I said, do you have pants for men in all she could say was, oh honey, you seem like you, you're very stressed. And I think I almost I think I almost burst into tears.
So yes, unfortunately they didn't have any pants that were the right length. So my pants were a little short in the link department, but they ultimately fit enough. So I've been arrived only to get to the rehearsal dinner right as it was in. Oh, no. Oh my God.
Sorry, the rehearsal, the rehearsal is it was any I still made. OK, good, at least because because the application of the end of the rehearsal dinner means that you miss the entire rehearsal and the dinner. Yeah, well, I mean, the dinner was nothing but bread fest and being gluten free.
I might as well. But I got to talk to people. Wow, that's stressful. You know, mad props though to Moran consignment for being able to give you clothing for sale. Good prices too. Excellent. Please note, this is not sponsored by Moran consignment.
However, they're more than happy with like we will gladly talk about them again. Yes. I mean, I hope that I will never have this situation every good. But if you two are in that situation, you can visit.
Yeah, to our listeners in the stock bridge area of Michigan, be sure to check out Moran consignment on Main Street. Also, every streetlight was out. And the train track bridge was down, although no train was coming. Wow. This place was cursed. Wow. Well, I'm glad you made it out alive.
That's happy. That's that's only the second time I've had to take shoots. I'm in the middle of nowhere. I'm afraid I'm going to die. Really. I'm that's impressive. That's impressive.
What about you, Kathy? What shout out? Yeah, I got a shout out for my buddy and yours, James the panda who took it upon himself. I have had a very difficult few weeks, a difficult conduit, as they say.
And my favorite panda helped me through it in a very supportive and healthy, but also like not overly anything. So yeah, just major, major props for James for helping me get through the last couple weeks. Again, the only panda that I appreciate.

It's fine. Everything's fine. Okay. Moving on. So to our connection check. Zapp. Zabby. Zabby. What apparently were jazz. Zabby. Excellent.
Jay, how did you do on your connection? I have been thinking outside of helping my best friend get married and all the things that come with that everything else has been consumed with how am I going to survive the madness that is my ever changing team. I was doing it.
Or as I put it to a friend earlier who asked how I was doing. I said, I feel like a cat on a crack. It's everything. It's was it everything always at once. Every all the things. Everything everywhere. All the ones I think all at once. Yes. But yes.
I definitely tried something different the last two weeks of doing my, you know, domi method of of analog productivity. And I'll, I can probably add a picture. I might have to scrub some things on it. But I think I can add a picture. I'm going to be going eventually. So sorry people listening live.
Of what I tried this week. And I think that I'm going to be going a little back to the drawing board still, but ultimately the TLDR on it if you're not looking at the photo is instead of having like events and all this other stuff.
I'm going to have mostly space for just projects and what I'm doing with them that we. Okay. And then there will still be a little space for events, but nearly not as much. Also significantly less space for excursions.
And I added a new space called around the office, which is just here are things that are happening that you should know about.
You don't necessarily have to do any work on, which is kind of the thing that I was more anxious about than anything of just like, oh, hey, there's all this stuff happening. I don't really need to act on the idea of it, but I should know about it at least.
So yeah, that plus new pens means that I have a better look at how I'm structuring some of this stuff. There's also a question of if I want to also do a daily log of like, oh, I did this and then I did this and then I did this stuff too.
I'm playing around with Timerie as kind of the thing for that. Yeah, I know. Shout out to the invisible third host of the show, Scotty desk. He only comes on when we are traveling in one one of us is traveling in London. Oh, Scottie comes in.
But yeah, I had a good long conversation with him about the problem in my automatic time tracking using timing. And I needed something that was more like, okay, I am committing to working on this. I am going to start the timer work on it.
And then when I'm done working on it, stop the timer to then analyze like, okay, how much time am I actually dedicating to this? Because my my fear is that I'm not giving it as much time as it deserves.
And then like, now I'm looking at it and I'm like working on things in like three hours sprints, which seems like, no, that sounds like a good bit of time. So yeah, we'll see what happens there. The other option there is to just log it in on paper. Yeah. But I don't know. We'll see.
I have concerns. But ultimately, I did the thing. I'm going to have to keep doing the thing. That's not going to be my connection for this week. But I'm going to be thinking about it. And then I know in like two more months when we do our system check in, then. And we'll probably address it again.
That sounds like a good plan. I love the movement that you've made, especially because I know how busy your schedule has been. And kind of how. It's got to be stressful to be making any changes when you're not at home. So I hope that you're able to continue that progress. That's excellent.
So my connection is also green check mark. I did in fact, phone a friend and by phone a friend, I mean, sent text requests to several friends and clients for feedback. And I'm asking some specific questions to kind of fill out the thing for my focus course. Do Hickey, Magikar.
And I think I need to do this. Or something similar to it more often, because it was really, really nice to hear the good things about me. And for some reason, I don't get a lot of individualized feedback like for podcasts and stuff that we do. I don't know why am I scary, my intimidating.
I don't know. But that's no reason I am okay asking. I should be able to ask more. So I am going to maybe like every six months or so. I'm not the same people, but kind of to get a little hit of good vibes or kind of like how I'm doing with other people. I don't know. I'm unsure.
I don't know what it's going to look like, but I am very thankful for the push that it did to get me out of that little safety circle. Yeah. Okay, what about Brat's connection. So Brat said connection check, green check mark. I pulled out 20 pins.
I have seen these 20 pins to sell and grabbed all of their respective packaging and box them up. Next up pictures and product descriptions. I don't know if all 20 are going to be for sale. I'm not sure if I've been on the internet, but I think it's a good site. But, uh, yes. Brad has been.
Brad has been extra busy. Like, I've, I've tried to bug Brad more than usual. And I wasn't even here as much as I was the last few weeks and Brad was just not available for so many things. So to even get started with the process. significant dedication to like I'm going to work on this now.
So good job, right? You can do it. Yay, you can did it. All right. Starting out with our fantastic conductors, pathologists of the show, Laura, connection check, green book. I was able to get all of the conference and lecture prep done and get all of my classes signed out.
Minimal guilt, putting some other things to the side temporarily and only had a couple days that felt truly overwhelming. So amazing that you were able to get all of that done and I'm really proud of you for acknowledging the guilt but not letting it overwhelm you too much.
Next is the guitar, so the show Scott who says green check mark 5k is done. Yay. I've been resting for about a week, but I did it and I didn't feel like dying. Congratulations. I danced at a wedding reception and I felt like I was dying.
I'm sure if I've capable significantly harder, but you can't do it. Sure. All right. Our owl of the show, Kate, has green check mark got my portfolio done apart from a few pages that will be done this week and continued sorting at a steady pace without making my room unusable.
I also finally sent an email I'd been procrastinating on for ages. Love that bonus connection check. Fantastic. That's amazing, especially the part about not making your room unusable.
I know when I get into a major sorting issue, I tend to get overwhelmed and then stop in the middle and I have just piles of everything and you can't use the room and that's not good. So really proud of you. Good job, Kate.
Our the last file of the show, Ponderz says, leaves I've digitized my six year plan. Oh, six years. I've got a clear goal and check points for project so that I can reschedule things months in advance rather than feeling like a failure and crunching at time I had hoped to finish a project.
That's a long time.
I look forward to hopefully having you know have you check in with us on where you are in your six year plan and don't just mean like by the days but like if you're in track ahead of track behind track you know on track I almost said M track and I was like I think that's a different thing.
I think that's for I think that's for our training. Our M track. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But great job on on being able to come up with a plan that you know looks into the future quite a bit. Our soprano of the show Debo green check mark.
I had a successful trip to my cousin's wedding and met two of my brothers children that I've never met in person before. I made a little bit of progress with prioritizing my work tasks but then got a plot twist for my new connection.
I snuck a peak at what the new connection is and I can't wait to share it but well done Debo Debra. I'm so happy that you were able to make it out nothing big happened and you got to meet new kids. Excellent. Your wedding wasn't in Michigan. Let's see our Oracle of the show.
Sof says yellow heart I've been attempting to fit in writing time here and there but I haven't been well so it hasn't gone as well as I've hoped I'm going to keep plugging away.
 No again as I mentioned Debrad like about or I guess about Brad the fact that you've you've even been considering it or squeezing minor amounts of time in I hope it wasn't at the the sacrifice of your health but if if you were able to do both of those things take care of yourself and also squeeze in a little bit of writing I think that you you've done a great job in that so good job.
All right panda the show James green check mark I'm doing pretty well about not stressing out about impending Apple related deadlines. I know I don't have to get everything ready for day one and I'm trying to pace myself appropriately.
Of course I'm now stressing out about other things instead but that wasn't specified in my connection so I still claim my green tick absolutely absolutely you should be so proud I know I am proud of you.
Our slot for the show on can you says connection check this this will be a double as I missed last show for my prior exercise connection I hit a green heart though I had to fight with some lack of energy and executive function to do so. Ooh sounds like you had a case of brain fog.
 I set myself a follow up connection to call and get an appointment with the referred psychologist and I attempted to contact in the summer but the office was closed yellow circle I called but got their answering system left my name and number so partial success you did all that you could do and then you still don't have an appointment there yet edit the office called back and now I have an appointment so it's green all the way down.
 Really coaster of a ride there our blue dragon of the show sky has a yellow circle turns out changing habits is difficult well I tried to remember to read whenever possible it was too easy too much of the time to just mindlessly watch YouTube especially when I didn't have the energy to do anything else.
Hey that's actually it yes changing habits is very difficult and even some reading is great so I am super proud of you and I know that you can you can't do it you can keep doing it you can keep reading it I don't know moving on.
 Our nameless of the show Robert says he liked it so much he put a ring on it green heart we did it wedding went great honey moon was amazing just landed back home an hour ago I love your priorities amazing all right last up our train enthusiast of the show green square flight was great I did the travel I couldn't do everything I wanted but I had a great time I did the start of the QA vision things are happening excellent and glad you did all of the travel I am so excited that you are back and here and I can't wait to hear more about it and also Robert posted a photo in the live stream chat of their wedding day they both looked gorgeous and so happy oh my gosh so fun I love weddings I'm so excited for you and if you wanted to see all of the goodies that are put in the live stream chat you can hang out with us when we record this episode live on Tuesdays at 12 o'clock Pacific time which is whatever time it is your time around use the app else when to figure that out yourself and you can also hang out in the discord and send us your connections we'll put some more information at the end of this episode until then how about a sponsor this episode of conduit is sponsored by hover have you ever thought about starting your own business creating a brand sharing your wealth of knowledge with the world using your years of experience to create something for yourself hover wants to help you take the first step and getting your ideas off the ground if you have a brand that you've always dreamt of building or business you want to take online the first step is finding your domain name hover makes this super simple with a clear and straightforward user experience easy to use tools and truly amazing support from friendly humans it's never too late to step up to the plate and share what you have to offer getting online has helped thousands of people around the world reach new heights with their businesses I own so many domains and they all start with doing a search on hover someday I'll actually start using my twitch channel and use missusoup.

Kathy I don't know about you but my brain's been a little foggy lately.
 I know that earlier you asked me to do the thing that we do before every show where we set up the document and do all that stuff and I think you were witness to me saying like yeah I can do that wait how do I do that wait I know how to do that and then I proceeded to do it wrong and I don't know the people they get to listen to the early parts of the show will have definitely experienced some of the fogginess as I'm like accidentally deleting sponsor reads and like barely managing to make it.
I'm glad you messaged me because I looked at the watch and said oh I gotta go.
Yeah I was I was kind of waiting for you to like make any sort of like mention or comment and then all of a sudden here it is 15 minutes till noon and I haven't heard from you and I was like uh oh we should check on this.
So yeah we're talking about brain fog and uh Kathy what causes brain fog for you. A lot of times if I am like so overwhelmed that I cannot concentrate on even like a single thing.
 Everything in my brain as soon as I try and like touch it aka think of it think of something it just dissolves like when you play with bubbles and the bubbles pop and like sometimes I can sit and I can like do a brain dump or journaling or like just writing things and it can clear the fog but a lot of the time it's useless like I I can't get past it until it passes and it's really exhausting.
 Well I mean like you said overwhelmed is is kind of a big a big ticket item there uh usually and I don't want to jump in the solutions just yet but like usually once I realize that I'm in a fog it it means that I'm doing too much which uh as an article that I'm working on uh one of the people that I interviewed for it quoted uh I'm not good at context switching and there's often a lot of thrashing involved so um that that is kind of the feeling and that's that's for the fogginess like I guess replace thrashing with fogginess uh usually if I'm having to work on multiple projects context switch a lot uh often the fog comes in that transition from one thing to the next mostly because my mind is still centered on that other thing um as earlier when I said I would get pictures and I had to sneak away to go grab a note like my notepad and and check it for content and stuff and then syncathy super secret pictures of the stuff that I bought and and all of those it was like in my head it was like okay if I don't do this right now it just won't happen and then cathy will be asking me for it later while I'm doing something else and then and then there will just be more fog but in that moment I caused fog because I'm like thinking about all those things instead of like thinking about where we're at with the show and like how to continue that process so yeah usually usually my fog comes often from like hey Jay you're doing too much yeah uh that that is it's interesting because I almost feel like I have less brain fog if I have set tasks that are being like if someone else is asking for them so like if I have you know meetings and a document that has a deadline for today and something that's someone else is asking for um I'm usually I usually have like less brain fog than if I have like 10 things to do but they're all things that maybe don't have to be done today and I'm choosing to put them on my to-do list so if I if I don't have external pressures it just kind of is it like ends up floating in my head and just like ta-da-da-da-da and then it transfers from clouds into fog and I can't grasp at anything and so it becomes really difficult to get past that because I can't concentrate it on it or figure out like even even something as simple as okay prioritizing or a lot of times I will even you know all vaguely know things that need to get done but I can't pick one because I can't figure out that starting point like it's it's so difficult to get anything anything done even any sort of prep work that needs to get done to have something done when you're in the midst of brain fog yeah so the perils of brain fog are are you know the things you just mentioned but is there a way that we can we can like reframe of like oh uh I keep wanting to say fog you went accordingly you're right sorry but like is is there a way that we can we can take that fog and like use it to our advantage or or maybe this is where like you know our good friend the tire method comes in of being like hey you know now it's time to you know the fog and the tire can be due to just not having enough time for things it could be not you know our intuition is like we shouldn't really be doing this anyway or something like that uh I just wonder is there a is there a way that we can address I'm in a fog state I'm in and I mean I'm in a fugues state but like no I'm in a fog state um let's let's address this and and like when I'm thinking about that I'm even thinking in terms of uh I'm going to throw out a buzzword well um cognitive behavioral therapy wow which is like that moment of this thing is happening this is how I feel in this moment let me begin to slowly dissect observe and then resolve this process so that I can move past it yeah it's it's funny though because anytime I try and force myself past something I end up almost the fog comes thicker mm because I don't know it's and was gonna try and make some sort of metaphor but my metaphor is foggy foggy yes um but it okay wait no I got it it's it's kind of like ghosts if you acknowledge the ghosts they get stronger right everyone knows this anyone that's read any sort of paranormal fantasy anything um and so figuring out how to ignore them or at least work around the ghosts you know we're in spooky spooky season so it's bear with me um working around the ghost the fog this this thing on almost anything uh being able to get past it without acknowledging it can sometimes help it move on so so instead of uh Kate and the chat said it's like walking into a bit of a video game that isn't unlocked yet that made me think of uh Metroid um and for those I don't know Metroid is a game on Nintendo it's a very old game they make they make new ones from time but Metroid is very very uh well known for having like areas that you need special power-ups to get past and oftentimes you have to like keep playing ignoring that section only to go back to it later with all of the tools that you need in order to get through it for me one of the hardest things though is to mentally acknowledge if I'm in a fog um because a lot of times you'll be you know man I just can't today I can't even and or odd and you you know two hours later and you're just like what what have I been doing all day and you can't get anything done and you haven't done anything maybe you haven't even eaten or or drink coffee or anything here just like what the heck is going on and then when you're like uh my brain is all foggy that's why like that like the lesson of learning and like trying to learn when you're in the fog similar to like when you have no energy a lot of times you're you're fighting so hard to to get things done the way that you think that it should be done that you can't understand like where you're at necessarily I don't know do you have that problem too where you don't recognize you're in the fog until like something big happens so I would say I recognize what I'm in the fog I just don't you know our chat has devolved into video game references where fog or impairments are involved and I have helped with this so I'm going I'm going to use the references that I put in the chat which is in Mario Kart where when you get ink like you recognize that you're inked but you don't you kind of just have to wait it out like that's that's what I feel like I'm often do is I'm just driving knowing that I'm I'm not gonna say that I'm driving impaired uh don't drive in pairs no definitely not but I feel like that's how I'm like navigating it I'm just working as if like oh I know I'm in a fog right now and I mean just like with fog usually what you're told to do is like well make sure you have your lights on make sure you do all these other precautionary things and you just kind of have to drive through it knowing that eventually it goes away um that's kind of where I'm at is is like I I wish that I had more things in place for when I'm in the fog not necessarily for knowing when the fog is there because I tend to I tend to notice really quickly only because it happens about every day of like oh I'm in such a fog right now um but figuring out what I can do to alleviate the fog to me is more important because I feel like that's the reason I'm in it every day is because I'm driving in it not necessarily avoiding it like I think that there are probably other things I could be doing that would make the situation better I just generally don't know what those things are so when when you're in that fog and you can't is is this something where you could go to a list of things on your someday maybe um and work on something different that maybe you have the energy for that isn't like normally a high priority whether it's I don't know cleaning the windows or you know deep scrubbing the baseboards or something like physical that maybe we'll get you out of the location base thing because I know a lot of times like if I change locations it can be helpful um you know you're you're moving through you're you're adjusting something um or a nap or a shower sometimes we'll work um or if there's a way that you like was mentioned in the chat you know watching training videos um something that can can move productivity along but doesn't take a lot of energy uh this is where I usually just call Kathy Campbell on and out haha which I love it's my favorite thing and I definitely don't automatically go J are you dead well no of course not because I'm calling you know but that doesn't mean that it's logical what my brain is doing it.
Thanks.
 Yeah but no I say that because usually if if I'm in a point where I am at a standstill my my goal is often you know talk to somebody like it's like if you have a clog which is similar to fog um you know you you can only work with the tools that you have before you have to call in the professionals and for me my professionals for just fun.
 And they have different tools and they say well you try this tool maybe this tool works and then I try that and I go oh you know it did kind of work a little bit um I don't think it necessarily like gets all of it out but you know it's enough to at least get me moving forward again yeah um and that's to me that has been kind of my go to I I want to try in the future to kind of set up I don't want to say like like a project process um I love the idea of pre-mortems the idea of like hey before I even start working on this let's identify all of the things they could come up and like potential workarounds for them that said I never do them so it's like I don't I don't think that's gonna work um but but I do like the idea of of moving into kind of a state of focus on like like this this week I'm working on this this big blog post for work and it's like there are other projects that I know I will need to work on but the important thing is that I get this blog post finished because it needs to get edited it needs to get peer reviewed it needs like it has like all these things that have to happen yeah and those things can't even start until I'm done with that post so it's like I I'm not even going to try to put myself in a fog state because I know that like if I start worrying or thinking about these other things then I will never get to the point where there will be a little bit of clarity and I know that that place exists because I had another project that literally the day of the wedding where I'm supposed to be like hey I'm here to support the groom and like be the best groomsman that I can I'm over there like stressing because the thing that I was supposed to wrap up that day didn't work and it's like there's nothing you can do you don't have your laptop you can access it via your phone also you're at a wedding you should be focusing on that but all of those things it literally came down to like sitting in the airport before I could clear that fog but once I had it done and once it was out it was like such a huge way it seemed like the clouds cleared up and it was like oh and now I can just focus on this one thing because this is now the most important thing before that was the most important thing now this is the most important thing so to me often like I guess treating that fog is almost an indicator of like like I said usually it happens when you're doing too much but that fog is often the result of whatever the thing you should be tackling is so as long as you have the ability to focusing on like I'm just going to get this done and when it's done hey fog's gone or a new fog rolls in which is you know another issue that you have to work on but at least then you're not battling two fogs, you're only battling the one that's so interesting to me because I don't necessarily get a fog when I am like really nervous or something about a project or overwhelmed with a specific project because usually if I if I have that specific project I know what needs to be done and I'm just not choosing but like the executive dysfunction of doing it is is pushing back and like I don't want to do it even if it's totally like it will maybe not take you know a minute but there are definitely some things that I have put off and put off and put off because I was not scared but kind of scared and then it takes 30 seconds and I'm like what what like how did this happen uh yeah so it's interesting to kind of I wonder and like I know that it seems to me that brain fog affects everyone differently um and it comes and maybe hits us different points in our days or a project or whatever and it also seems to pass differently like I definitely definitely have some days where if I just push through the fog lifts or I'm useless no matter what I do and I just instead of getting frustrated by being in the fog I have to just be like okay cool I'm done for the day like clearly nothing is gonna get done because everything in my brain I keep trying to touch and it it dissolves um that was a lot of how I was feeling last week um there was one day where I basically played Sims most of my day because I could not do anything I could not even focus on a task and and do the bare minimum to get that done and it was really not it was really hard to not let myself be hit with this level of grief for being a quote-a-quote bad person I know I'm not a bad person I know I'm not a bad business owner I'm not a bad client employee any of this but I knew that anything I tried to start was not gonna happen because I could not even get to the part where I was gonna pick something to begin so I know that and this this was a potential topic for today which I'm sure we'll probably talk about in the future um I've been diving extremely deep into my work lately um like 12-hour days level of work and again no one is asking me to do this I'm doing it on my own which to me again this is like hey when when work takes when it takes you longer to navigate from one point in your life to the next usually fog you know that's that's a thing that's a that's a very that's a very like real parallel of like hey it takes you longer at least it should if you're driving in fog because you should be driving slower um but I I wonder if that's all not bad if if contained um because like you said you mentioned you know I needed to get away from kind of the reality of life so I played the simulation of life yep which I don't know if you know what Sims is but we've talked about a lot of video games yeah it's a video game episode it's fine except for Tetris I'll see there there now obligatory test for good uh but I wonder if there's a way to to just acknowledge like hey I'm in I'm in a fog I but I don't have anything at the moment that's time sensitive maybe maybe we just you know we take we take a token so we don't we don't do it too often but we take a token and say hey I'm gonna work on this tonight I'm gonna work on this once the fog is lifted and if the fog doesn't lift um I had someone tell me about our last show is that you know it's it's a great that we are in a position of our our careers where uh we have the privilege of being able to to work when we want to work uh and take breaks when we want need to take breaks uh I say privilege is often best when used in the right way so let's exhaust a little bit of that privilege and be like hey if I can if I can work anytime or if I can get away with quiet quitting for a day like I'm just let's just do that and and just be okay with it because what is the what is the alternative being extremely stressed out feeling guilty because you're playing Sims when instead you're like oh I I should be working well no you set your hours so like you work when you feel it's time to work and right now playing Sims is probably the best thing you can do for your work because you're gonna do your best work once you're done no one will die because I didn't send an email um I'm not doing you know I'm not getting hit by brain frog brain fog in the middle of surgery don't get hit by a brain especially because you know that would just like unsterilize the surgical field if you get hit by a brain frog title it's absolutely title good job so uh getting pelted by brain I love it um except I hate it because now I'm like imagining somebody doing surgery and you're opening up the body and like frogs are come come flying out so maybe that's less um helpful uh so now now I'm in this position I know I cut you off it's okay I'm in this position of does it become easier if instead of brain fog this thing that we've always looked at is like oh it's so darker you know it's so annoying and it is just like if we look at it as brain frogs and we're just like okay oh it's a brain frog and when you touch it instead of popping it hops away yeah it just hops away like get out of your little brain frog okay okay I'm digging this I could see how you know instead of being scared of it or trying to get past it or would not make friends with the frogs um pet them a little bit uh hang out frogs are cute hanging out on uh some lily pads and toad stools because that's where frogs hang out obviously at all times um like almost taking a moment to acknowledge where you're at and then you can hopefully get past it maybe I think so and and again it's as we we've tried to say for 30 plus episodes now there's there's so many things that we treat as this super serious thing and that's that was the whole concept of conduit is like okay we're going to de-seriousness the productivity space because like for real everybody treats this as if uh you know it's a matter of life and death but I I think that once we look at it as oh you know just a little brain frog it's fine yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah just shoot it away just shoot shoot like it's it's right don't bother me exactly I think that's a fly though I I love this idea now um I mean I don't love it because it's still gonna gonna gonna happen but this idea of reframing um kind of where you're at uh and letting it settle you know it's not ghosts anymore we're switching away from the ghosts where you know you don't want to acknowledge it yes frogs are absolutely cute I will probably steal slash borrow one of my child's like eight frogs stuffed animals that they have in their bedroom currently because they have a lot a lot a lot a lot a lot of frogs frogs and mushrooms is in there in in their bedroom um sounds like a lot of toad stools they actually like they want a stool that looks like a toad stool very badly but they don't have their room clean enough to have another seating location um also toad stool a character in Mario another you already did Mario Kart that's like close enough oh goodness well you know we fixed it we we fixed it we fixed brain but we have defogged by making it a frog that's some magic it's something that's definitely something but good job we can't do it we absolutely can't did it heck yeah rails you get that download hotel giant to play it play all of the games find some some some ways to relax and breathe and take a moment yeah the show's not over yet this guy because we're still going but we can still say you can't did it it's not like an automatic like turning off the the stream uh but it's a way to we're done with the topic how about that ha ha instead uh let me tell you about our sponsor masterclass this episode of conduit is brought to you by masterclass with masterclass you can learn from the world's best minds anytime anywhere and at your own pace with over 150 classes from a range of world class instructors in 11 different categories that thing you've always wanted to do is closer than you think you can learn the art of negotiating from Chris boss improve your culinary skills with Mexican cooking by Gabriela Kamara learn about disruptive entrepreneurship from Richard Branson or learn how to make compelling videos that go viral with Marcus Braoli also known as MKB HD okay so I was lucky enough to come in and get a subscription for masterclass which is something that I've always wanted to do and actually doing it um was incredible I took three classes so far um I did Annie Leibovitz teaches photography Ron Finley teaches gardening and Misty Copeland teaches ballet technique and artistry so Misty Copeland's obviously I am not a prima ballerina but I did dance when I was younger and getting to kind of work through like I did some of the warm-ups along with her um I and just watching the beauty of her movement but also talking about stuff in her journey and where she started I learned that she doesn't use toe pads with her point shoes because her point teachers like taught them to not use toe pads which is very don't try that at home please wear protection on your toes if you're doing point but she's like oh yeah this is how I was taught and I just don't and that's just something that I didn't know and I thought I knew a lot about Misty and she performed several different ballet variations and the the way that these are almost presented as if they are like super high quality YouTube videos in that they're like 10-15 minute sometimes 20 minute chunks so they're smaller videos so you don't feel like you're okay I got to sit down and I got to watch three hours of this so it's easy to just add a little bit throughout your day learning new things was really inspired when watching Inelie Boots I want to get into a studio and do some of the portraiture that she did and that she talked about um it just was really inspiring and I mean Ron Finley if you haven't heard of him he's incredible um he basically creates these gardens in the city space of highways and things um and hearing his story and how he got started but also having some real tips on how I can garden and maybe not kill my plants so I have bought some bulbs and I'm hoping to grow some flowers in the spring so stay tuned that might be a

the middle of a brain frog how about that there you go actually that's a good idea when you when you have when there's a frog in your way uh maybe there's a masterclass lesson on how to catch frog oh I'll have to look but probably not but maybe maybe in the meantime what's your connection for the next conduit so I mentioned it uh I'm heading back oh oh can I do two am I allowed to do two everybody I guess it's so I'm doing two for a reason um my birthday is in a couple of days well at at the time of this of other people hearing this the people that aren't listening live my birthday will be that day my birthday is is on conduit day yeah um there is one thing that I've been wanting to do for a while which was sit down and have a very expensive drink with my mom and and I mean very expensive is like I want to one I want to get a nice bottle of whiskey and share that with my mom who doesn't drink whiskey um but have a relaxing hey we're adults let's just talk about adult stuff um um conversation and my mom has agreed to this but I know that uh as parents are there are always concerns that come up and things like that and I want to just tell my mom I'm doing good I mean if you ask me how's my mental health at various day by day but like for right now I think I'm doing good and I I want the courage to be able to say that so I am saying now that one of my connection checks is to uh enjoy a you know very nice dinner and drink uh with my mother and just give her the reassurance that do alright um but then the other one is I will be back home next week uh there's an episode of conduit called getting back into the swing of things I might need to listen to that episode it's one of the first ones so it might be rough I don't know uh but I will need to get back into the swing of things and a lot of that is um doing things not necessarily differently or going back to how I was doing them before I think that this trip I have learned a lot I mentioned I've been working way more than I normally do and I want to examine why that's happening and I think I know why but I think the only way I can test that theory is once I'm back home where I have a computer at a desk and not like my MacBook my my theory is separation of concerns so I might be removing my laptop my personal laptop from our work org which I mean this is all like everything's above above board here with that it's it's more of just like oh hey if I can't do work on my laptop that means I have to do work on you know a device that work is designated yeah so it'll it'll prevent me from working beyond my usual self so again nice dinner with mom but also come up with a plan of action on what to do with with device I'm not going to say I'm committed to doing it yet because I got to see and make sure that everything is done the right way um so there might be like an in-between measure until then but we'll see we'll get there I love that um okay so my connection last week I so I hadn't been to the co-working space for a few weeks mainly because I couldn't necessarily leave Ryan because he couldn't do anything because he only had he had no working hands but he's finally getting more stable and able to do more things for himself which means I can go to co-working space um I could have gone I was basically making excuses for a little bit um and when I did go it was really helpful to get out of my own head um and so I am going to make a connection to start going to the co-working space again uh even if it's just for a little bit a lot of the the kind of mental block was oh I can only go for four hours so that's not enough time yes it is totally enough time to go and be in a space that's separated from everything else like that's okay I can do that uh so yeah my thing is going to be um going more often to the co-working space I just realized I was talking about figuring out my system I didn't have a space for my connection checks but I do now excellent all right our pathologists of the show Laura their connection is I have some unstructured days coming up these next two weeks at work I need to plan ahead what I want to focus on each day and have done at least a little work on whatever projects I decide to focus on every day otherwise I will just jump from one task to another and have trouble making any real progress I can't wait to hear how this goes I think you're going to do an incredible job especially because you've written it out uh that means you're partially there for a plan so you can do this our guitarist of the show Scott says new connection slowly get back to exercising and continue getting used to my new oh my new my new yeah anxiety meds uh yeah take time take the time that you need to uh to get adjusted and of course uh continue to work with your

the website so that the new pages are ready to go live even have more details will be added later hopefully I'll also be able to get my CV ready by the next show so I can start actually looking for jobs fingers crossed absolutely fingers crossed Kate you can do it uh planked out for one second all right the last follow the show ponders says uh recurring tasks I want to brainstorms all the things I do or want to do in periodic intervals and find a way of capturing them scheduling them and holding myself uh to account uh I mean considering you've gotten the last six years figure right I would assume all the recurring tasks have already been taken up and you you can do that I it's gonna be great all right I just a prando of the show Deborah plot twist so exciting my boss let me know that he's retiring at the end of the year and he wants me to take over his role part of my connections between now and the end of the year we'll be figuring out how to do the new job but while he's still around to help with the transition the rest of my connection for the next fortnight is to take care of my husband and various things around the house while he recovers from a minor surgery I am so excited for your new job opportunity uh I love that your boss just was like yo you're gonna do I want you to do this like what a refreshing piece of like support I just think that's great uh and I hope you can find some peace and rest in between of taking care of your husband and the house uh and learning a new job definitely our Oracle of the show's sof says new connection same connection carve out a few periods of writing time every week and do the writing thing hey it's it's called a practice for a reason yes you know I love it get this get this practice underway and and get it into your normal routine absolutely our panda of the show James hi my fixer by nature but I should recognize that I can't and shouldn't try to fix every situation I will still help other people as I am able to but I shouldn't break myself in the process of doing so absolutely James and uh you know I will help hold you accountable our soft of the show on cano says uh clean up my home office hobby space basement living room yes that's all one space uh every surface is covered with items paint models tools papers I got to clear some space uh yeah uh a clear space is a clear mind as someone would want you to believe um but also I'm the type of person that if I don't see it it doesn't exist yeah it's a delicate balance yes so best of luck in your journeys our blue dragon of the show uh their connection is to come up with a connection for the next fundo it excellent can't wait to hear what you figure out and then our our friend of the show Maddie our friend of the show Maddie says uh apply to five project management positions and finalize capsule wardrobe plans I I don't fully know what capsule wardrobe is but I'm I'm hoping that it's like a time capsule um where you put a bunch of clothes from the 2020s to a time capsule so people can in like 2050 when they're like flying and something be like uh I remember when people had to wear shoes because they had to walk on the ground not quite uh but capsule wardrobe is is you've got the first part of it right you basically put specific clothes into the capsule known as the closet basically it's an idea of uh fewer clothing that you are able to use in multiple different ways to make a variety of outfits um but also to wear not quite a uniform where you have the same you know jeans and t-shirts that you wear every time but the idea that you have fewer choices to make because you have fewer clothes makes sense to me got it all right nameless of the show robber says new connection gets settled with my wife in our temporary place make sure all systems are moving in the right direction for our home to finally finish the renovations excellent I apologize for the my wife it had to be done congratulations and lastly our train enthusiast of the show railsy says new connection keep doing the joby-job thing for qa continue along the second joby-job interview process to get into a dream company even as a contractor the door is opening to put my foot in there you go see I love as we've been watching this journey unfold like different ways of of getting to where you want to go have kind of been revealing themselves
