From Relay FM, you're listening to Conduit, the show we Condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Condu it, the show that prefers connections over layovers. This episode is brought to you by Devon Technologies and CrowdStrike.
I'm your conductor Jay, keeping things on the rails. And with me is my life unicorn, which is much better than a life coach. The one the only Kathy Campbell. What's out Kathy? I agree 100%.
Because life coach to me sounds like one of those Instagram scammers that's like, I'm going to fix everything in your life. And I much prefer a sprinkle glitter over everyone and help them support them to figure out their own life.
Well, I'm sure you saw my tweet earlier where I had inspiration to start another thing. And then in my head, I had like a unicorn like land on my shoulder and go like, now is not the time in your life to be making changes like this. So yes, I will give you the full life unicorn title.
But I think we have some shout outs to go through unity years first. No, actually, I don't. I would like you to do your first. Find them just because if you notice the notes in the document, I mind will do a flow into the next piece. So yours is a good one to start and mine is not.
And also, I apologize for I think I don't know if it's a leaf blower or an edge trimmer or something going. Hopefully it will stop soon. So I apologize, I'll be here if you have to take care of it. I have two kids playing in the room behind me. I'm sure it's fine.
So yeah, shout out goes to my friend Reggie. I had to do a couple of events these past few weeks. I was in Austin, Texas and then I had to go to Tucson, Arizona. And in between, it didn't make sense to fly home for three days.
So instead, I got to spend three days in Houston, Texas, which I will say kind of a fan. I've had really good. I went to a place that was a bar, a coffee shop, a vinyl store and a vegan restaurant and it was a black owned business. It was absolutely wonderful. The food was amazing.
The wine was amazing. Everything was absolutely wonderful. I had a great time. While I was there, my friend Reggie, she kind of showed me how I should really be living my life. I call her my big brother because we're like a couple of years apart and just staying with him.
One, work life balance was amazing. Like taking meetings in the car on the way to the grocery store, like going to actual places where people met in person and like worked but worked in like small little collective groups on their own different things, which was absolutely amazing.
And then also forcing me to do yoga and forcing my poor body to be destroyed by the sweats and the stretching and all the things. But it really gave me this encouragement that now that I'm back home, at least for a few more weeks. I started going on walks. I've been working out.
I've been eating like good smoothies and like things like that. And it's absolutely wonderful. And I started doing baby yoga, which is like real yoga and that it hurts my body. But at least there's a really fun story that goes along with it. That is a great idea. Oh my gosh.
I love that idea because yeah, the baby yoga or like story time yoga. Or we have a local yoga person that I can't think of what their thing is called that I met when I was like an exhibit at a event thing. And it's just so much more fun. And the poses that you do like go along with the story.
That's a great idea. I need to find them on YouTube and do some of that. It also encourages my little one to do yoga with me, which is great. I mean, I'm pretty sure she doesn't need to stretch as much as I do.
But at the same time, I think it gets her morning started off at a good pace when she's having some bonding time and things like that. So it's yeah, for sure. Yeah, my little person also doesn't do yoga because it's too easy for that flexible bendy person. Oh, just wait. I know.
I keep trying to, yeah, maybe we'll go to a yoga class together. That might be a different vibe. We have a really good yoga studio here that I've been looking at starting to go to. But we'll see. We'll see. So my shout out.
It usually ends up being for the discord because that's where my heart lives. A very specific journey happened in the discord recently. Conductor Sof was going through a really difficult, not a difficult choice, but needed some support and love.
Everyone kind of came in and helped them write this incredible email to somebody to tell them like set boundaries. And first off, it's so brave to be able to like admit like what you need help with and be able to listen to different ideas and help define your boundaries a little bit more.
And then they came and like helped us proof an email to send. And it was super great to like just everyone was like, Hey, here's, here's some ideas. Obviously you can take or not take like there was no forceful. Oh my gosh, how dare you say X, Y or Z or anything like that.
And I just really love the fact that this community is such that it allows you to put out what you need into the world and you get that back. And so just getting confirmation in the live chat that they sent the email and everything. And so proud of you. So that's incredible.
We're so happy for you and for everyone. This is a great segue to talk about how to join our discord and hang out in the hashtag break room, best room, but also everywhere else in the incredible discord. Just go to relay.
fm slash conduit and join the membership and you too can come and get some support from you and a corn and some other fine folks and also get access to the live stream, which means when we are recording live episode of conduit, you can hang out in the chat room and give us updates to things that we talk about right there.
Yeah. You can also get all of the sneak peaks into the things that we may or may not be doing later in the year. Yes. We've got some great things coming up and it always gots to go to the discord first. So definitely, definitely join hang out with us. We would love to meet you. Absolutely.
And we also have some follow up copyrighted John Siracusa 20, 20 whatever. 20 date date.
This is great because for the people that normally are in the live stream, but if they miss the chat, like miss our recording, they then are able to give us some feedback in the discord right away using the same like follow up connection, check theme of bobbers that we have. Absolutely. Yeah.
And the first thing that we have is from Scott who says it. Love the episode. It reminded me of a saying that my wife and I have we take compliments in this house.
I love that because it reminded me of a saying that Kathy and I have with each other of like, hey, don't talk about my friend like that. Like if this is not something, if this is not something that you would allow somebody else to tell about your friend, you shouldn't say it to yourself.
And along those same lines, accepting the compliments, which we're going to talk about, you're accepting compliments later. But this past episode that we did, I don't want to talk about the show in the show a whole lot, but we kind of do.
But, you know, I loved last fortnight's episode so much and getting the feedback that we've gotten has just reaffirmed that fact. Rob was kind enough to talk about the fact that even Oscar winners feel imposter syndrome. And I am not even remotely close to an Oscar winner.
And so feeling on the same level with some of them though, is kind of nice. Yeah. And that means we can keep that imposter out of our bleeping mouths. Yes. But also, Shane Toss for reminded us that, you know, the devil's spaghetti is real and it's everywhere.
And when you know it's a thing, your brain will just keep asking whether this is the time when you'll be exposed. That is definitely a feeling.
And I think that kind of ties into the discussion we had about anxiety of just not knowing if the concern, the fear, the doubt, all of those feelings were valid or if it was just our anxiety talking.
And I think that's what makes it hard because we have to not only navigate our real lives, but we have to also navigate through those anxieties as well. And that is like a, it's like an extra burden.
It's like invisible work was the phrase that someone once told me that I really loved of, you know, you're not only doing your job, but you're also doing the job of validating or disproving your own anxieties. So Shane Toss, thank you for the reminder that it's not just me that goes through that.
Yeah. And I think it's important to be able to talk about things like anxiety and imp pasta. I can't say it. Just called the devil's spaghetti. Yeah. Talk about the devil's spaghetti. And Robert made a really good point, which by the way, Robert, we need to figure out your of the show title.
So make sure to message us and let us know. So we can put in the magical spreadsheet so we can remember for the future. But he's had like, he's the first in his family to go into college and now to this job is feeling the devil's spaghetti.
And he made a good point that even though he always knew that this was a thing others also expected. It's just hard to accept when you're feelings, what you're feeling as if you're the only one feeling like devil's spaghetti. This imposter, oh, Damon Carves, that's really good on.
We're going deep, we're going deep into the inside jokes. I love it because everyone's a welcome in this inside joke period or something.
But having those knowing that other people feel this way is so reassuring and being able to talk about it minimizes those brain bees a little bit and makes it so that they're not as powerful.
So keep it talking, keep letting people know when you're feeling the devil's spaghetti coming on because you deserve to be supported by the people in your world. See now you have me wanting to just come up with different terms for imposter. Right now I met Beelzebub's Lingweeney. Oh, nice. Nice.
Shaitan's ramen. I like that one, but you know what else I like? Our sponsor. What? Me too. This episode of Condo it is brought to you by DevonThink, the flagship product from Devon Technologies. DevonThink is the most professional document and information management application for the Mac.

And I talked before about how DevonThink allowed me to track all of my receipts for the latest conference that I went to.
But what happens when you're going to events and then going from those events to other events and from those other events to the other events that you have like traveling between that's personal, but you need to calculate that too because of business expenses and other things.

As they say, when you get a good compliment, thanks. Nice. So, Kathy, we've got a lot to talk about, but before we do that, I think we need to check in on our last episodes connections. Because it's time for a connection check.
How was your connection? So my connection was to compliment one person each day. I gave myself an orange circle because I complimented people when I remembered that this was my connection.
But I also realized now looking back the past two weeks that I complimented people even without remembering that this was my connection. So that might be a little bit of a hint to what my next Fortnite connection is, but I'm not going to spoil it.
Instead, I'm going to go, hey, Jay, how did your connection go? So I feel like in some ways I somewhat cheated because you gave me the compliment and then I contradicted myself and then said, oh, yeah, thanks.
But I did actually think about times when I was letting the Nudes Faratu take over, I'm sorry, that's Nudes Faratu's noodles for those who are interested in more devil spaghetti puns. I don't think anyone's interested in more devil spaghetti puns. Okay. Fair enough. I will. Just kidding.
They're fantastic. Keep them going. I'm sorry. Okay. But yes, I, as people were giving me compliments and the reasons why I was getting compliments will be made obvious soon, I was just very, it was hard to not go, oh, well, you know, I didn't really do anything or whatever, whatever, whatever.
But I remembered something that my wonderful unicorn friend told me once and I was like, no, you know what? I'm going to own this and I'm going to say thank you and I'm be okay with it and I'm going to be a little bit arrogant, but a lot of it humble and let it roll and honestly, like it felt good.
And I'm glad that Kathy, one of the things that you did was you were complimenting people without even realizing that that was your connection, which to me is good because it sounds like you've normalized the behavior so well that you do it with, you do it instinctually.
And that's something that I want to get to with being able to accept compliments. Yeah. It's a good goal. It's good goal. Go go go go go.
Speaking of speaking of good goals, Robert, who who is our person with no of the show of the show, had a good goal as well because he had a green circle connection check.
I feel like I've settled into my job and can see how much time I have to be able to share with my family and my fiance though not originally how I ordered the word of the connection.
I use the tire method what what to say, notice some project opportunities that came up and said, I have some more, I said, can I have some more time to think about one project I would love to do once I can be certain I actually have the time. Yes. Yes.
I love it when I when I have a wild tire sighting. So it's fantastic. All right. Our pathologist of the show, Laura, their connection check. I'm guessing as go after reading what it was. So we're going to give it. Let's see a green smiley face.
She continued giving time blocking a shot to help prioritize non urgent but important projects relatively successful when she remembered to do it ended up setting a reoccurring reminder. Is it reoccurring or recurring? I don't I don't know. Okay. Okay. Good.
In the chat though, she put her green colored thingy is a green book. So fantastic. So she ended up setting a recurring reminder in her task list to prompt her to time block daily. Weekly is too much at a time for me.
The end of the week kind of depends on how much she gets done earlier in the week. I love that you were able to make adjustments and say, nope, this X doesn't work for me. So I'm going to do why weekly is too much. So going daily, especially how it affects the rest of the week.
Like that's really impressive. And that's really once again, what these connections are for is helping you recognize and acknowledge what's going on in your life in your brain in your day, week, month, year, whatever. So that you can try and make changes that you want to make. So well done, Laura.
Also I believe it's that recurring events reoccur. Sure. That sounds like a valid reason and excuse. I am not a writer or an editor or an English major or a professor or anything like that. I'm just seen corn and I make words and sometimes those words are not correct. Sometimes they are.
So everyone that does do writing things. I'm so impressed. And you're wonderful. Our entire advocate of the show, Chinthas, gave us a red circle and says red circle, but a considered one. A number of unexpected things going wrong, man.
I decided it wasn't the best time to introduce new vice restrictions. To be honest, all but dealing with emergencies went out the window.
It sounds like you you definitely put a vice grip on things and you just said, hey, right now nothing else is important other than dealing with these emergencies. So again, we don't look at these as pass or fail. They are all just indicators of where we are in the journey.
So Chinthas, good job on at least understanding what your boundaries needed to be. And not setting those up for yourself, even if you weren't able to put anything in writing. So freaking literally Dungeon Master of the show, Papa Tibbs, their connection check is a green apple.
He finished his job, wrapped up all the loose ends and left started the new job today. Whole new industry, whole new size of company, lots to learn and kind of terrified.
Well, it's a good thing that you are the Dungeon Master of the show because even if you're terrified, you can decide what monsters are going to be behind the door and what traps are set and break through them or something because there's no monsters in this world.
You are managing it all or something. You're going to do great because you're awesome. And we all believe in you and support you and are here for you. Maybe our oracle of the show, so saw that coming, but what they didn't see coming was the yellow heart.
Our connection was to meditate five times a week and exercise three times a week. The first week got a perfect score. Didn't fill apart the second week when the work became stressful, which of course is when the meditation and exercise was needed. But they are pleased they got some done at least.
So that is quite all right. That being said, if you want someone to remind you, I am also trying to at least do some form of activity each day.
And since you're in our discord, maybe you can ping me and tell me whether or not you want a friendly reminder to maybe at least do like a quick five minute meditation or exercise or stretch or something. Yeah, that sounds like an absolutely great idea.
Our owl of the show Kate has a big green check mark or I guess a white check mark in a green box. Either way, so they got the building design done and the presentation last week went well.
Second deadline is the end of this week and they're confident that they'll get the report to a good point by then. And we are also confident that you will get that report done because you are absolutely kicking butt, taking names, doing an incredible job and you're almost there. You're so close.
I can feel it for you. I'm just so excited. And our sloth of the show also yellow circle says I seem to be just delaying all efforts to journal. Perhaps it's just not for them. Okay, it's been over a month of active procrastination.
I've implemented Zara the show Maddie's mood tracking shortcuts in the last week, however, and thought about what might go into journal entry without actually writing it. So partial credit, I guess. I think that's perfectly fine.
If I don't know if you follow me on Twitter, I think you do follow me on Twitter. You saw that even like I've been struggling with my bullet journaling habits and I've been working to like automate it a little bit to do like a digital thing.
And you know, honestly, I'm having the same problem where it's just like, maybe it's just not for me. And I try something new. It doesn't work. Go back to what does work. At least the fact that you were you were able to pull something out of it that was helping.
And who knows, maybe something new will pop up that makes it easier for you in the future, but at least you gave it a shot. And honestly, that's that's okay too. Absolutely. All right, our final connection check of this show is for the guitarist of the show Scott.
Mark on the 5K training that is continuing progress is good. No injuries yet. I love that. No injuries is very good. So is progress. And you're continuing that training, which is always great. So well done, Scott and well done to all of our conductors.
If you want to leave a connection and a connection check in the discord, hang out in the show follow up folder, you just put the conduit logo and then write your stuff after it and it will magically import into our spreadsheet.
You can also tweet with the hashtag my conduit and that will also put it in the spreadsheet. Or in any forum channel thing, if you do question mark my conduit, I will also put it in because we like to make it as easy as possible and yet it's still really complicated. But that's fine.
It's got a thing and no cake folder was not the word I was going for, but in my mind, all the channels are separate folders because that is how my brain works. Channel folder, it'll hold stuff. It's the same.
You know what's not the same though? I think by definition of the word, yes, changes are not the same. Yeah, so there's some changes happening and I will look at, I guess I will spill the, no, we're not going to go with any type of deity and or any fruit with beans. Tea? Yeah.
I'll spill the tea and say that I am leaving my current job in my last day at that new, at that old job is next Friday, which I am starting a new job. I haven't made a public announcement as to where I'm going yet and all those things don't worry.
My boss and my team know that I am leaving my existing job and no, I'm not trying to like pull a fast one and do two full time jobs because I can't do that. My life unicorn will not let me, but also it, yeah, my brain isn't wired for that kind of anxiety.
 But that means that I have to spend the next two weeks going into leaving job mode and doing day to day life mode and wrapping up loose ends so that I get all the monies that I'm owed for all the traveling that I've been doing mode and thinking about what's next and so many other things that and being a spouse and father and pastor.
Yes. And also a topic for two weeks from now. So there's a lot of stuff happening and we wanted to talk about the idea of like changes and how they present themselves in productivity. I always say there, I don't have an acronym for this, but who knows maybe there will be one.
Maybe by the end of the show. But yeah, Kathy has been, you've been like privy to this information for a while and I mean, it's, it's definitely been one of those things that I, I am, was like, it's not real, it's not happening. I don't know yet.
Everything is certain and all this and then all of a sudden it became very real, very quickly. Very real. And yeah, what about you? What changes do you have happening in your world? Well, the biggest change that happened is I finally have a corgi butt in my life or at least a half corgi butt.
 My kid and I were going to go hiking on Saturday because it was going to be beautiful whether we stopped by the bookstore to get some plant identification, mushroom identification and bird identification for our hike because clearly we needed the books because if we were out in the middle of nowhere, we would not have the internet and just all of these things.
So we left the bookstore and started heading to our hike location. Hey, and there was a sign outside of pet co that said dog event today, dog adoption event. And we had been talking about getting a dog and another dog for our family for a while. We're like, sure, let's stop by.
And that's where we met our Chihuahua corgi who is now in our life. I prefer the term, I prefer the term, corwawa. Oh, nice. See, Chorgi is kind of the like internet way of saying it mainly because cor, corwawa just sounds like you like miss some letters. No, it sounds adorable.
It's something that like my daughter would ask for, can I have the corwawa please? You're like, don't what? It does. Oh my goodness. Okay. So it's now a corwawa valid acceptable. Yeah, he is a four year old corwawa with the cutest little markings, the adorableist like little face.
He does not have the corgi fluffy butt. His fur is very much more of a Chihuahua fur, but he does have the shorter. It's like they took a portion of the legs and extended it on his back.
So he like is very, very much more like a corgi, especially when standing next to our other Chihuahua who is very much a Chihuahua. It's very cute. He is so sweet. He is currently on my feet right now, very quiet. And yeah, so that has made some changes into how our day goes through.
And I'm very excited to take Nandoor, the relentless because all of our animals are in alphabetical order. And so our letter was N.
And the discord was great enough to suggest names and help me pick out the best name, which is Nandoor, which is from what we do in the shadows, the Hulu show that Merlin Mann talks about so much in Alex. Yes. See, now if I get a dog, which I already have to, we don't need more animals.
Do not, do not start this lobbying with the rest of the people in my house. It will not happen. But if there was one to happen, I would have to name it Falcore because that is the true movie based pet name that is amazing and wonderful. That is very good choice.
But the thing I love about this was that the changes that happen as they happen often come with both optimism and dread. Having a new, a new fur baby in the house is like, awesome.
What if it peas on things? What if it scratches things? What did I do? No, that was messaging you when you sent me a picture. I was like, no, what did you do? Yeah, yeah, it's true.
Really when our dearest, so we currently, we already had a dog and two cats and because this was a rescue who came from Texas, they didn't necessarily have information on how they would do with cats. But he was also very chill.
He didn't interact or really like any sort of caring to the rest of the dogs that were in the adoption event. And so we're like, okay, it should be okay. If for some reason he was obsessed with cats and was going to eat their faces, it would be fine. We could return him and look for someone else.
But he's been totally fine. However, Merlin or Cat is very much a cat in the sense that he is a full jerk and keeps taunting Nandor to chase him. And then like I swear is laughing when Nandor gets told the N-O word and not necessarily in trouble, but kind of in trouble.
But these adjustments on, you know, taking some time to walk outside because he's not quite figured out the doggy door and as a little bit nervous to go outside and go potty and all of these things changes in my day also means that like I'm making these adjustments.
And okay, we got to make sure not only did I eat lunch before conduit, but I also needed to make sure that the dog went out to go to the bathroom before I start recording.
Like all of these little things that add up and can be overwhelming if you don't have control over them or if you don't like take a moment to be like, okay, what needs to happen? What can I do to make this easier?
And I think that's why it's important to have those like tire pressure checks of like, hey, I just added a new thing to my life.
How is this going to affect the rest of my life, the rest of my things? Kathy, if I remember correctly, when we were starting conduit, you know, almost a year, like, well, not, was it almost a year ago? I don't know. Oh my gosh, I don't even know. It's been a long time. It's been a long time.
Time is hard. Time is hard.
But yeah, when we were starting conduit, like, we were looking at like, okay, what does our current schedule have and what does doing a new show bring to that? And even in just planning like, do we go monthly? Do we go weekly? Do we go biweekly? Do we do like a five minute show every day?
None of these are options that members of the show can vote for.
I'm sorry. We have talked about this a lot. A very lot. A whole lot.
But like, a lot of the decisions that we had to make on our new thing, our new thing being conduit at the time was how does this affect the rest of life?
And I mean, I'm happy to say that with this new role, one of the things that I did was I have time off in between, not a lot of time, a little bit of time.
But that little bit of time is intentional. It's designed for me to get a lot of ducks in a row. And that is something that I had to be intentional about in that process. Yeah, absolutely. So I just went and I looked at the folder for conduit, just the info. I created the folder April 27th, 2021.
So we're almost at a year of conduit living in different forms, different formats, different things. But yeah, it's almost been a year of conduit in our lives. And what a year it's been. But we're not there yet. So we're not, we're still talking about changes.
I'm so happy that you're taking a week off and the ability to kind of close the chapter on one job before you open a new book. I think it's going to be really helpful, especially as you learn more about what your future job is going to be like. Because who knows what it's going to be like.
Yeah, I think that's been the biggest challenge for me. And thinking of terms of productivity, similar to what I believe it was Ankenu, it said, like, hey, nothing, or sorry, not Ankenu, I think it was Chingtas. Like, hey, nothing new is allowed to come up.
As I mentioned before, like seeing tweets about people needing help, getting podcasts and stuff off the ground, it was like, oh, no, in these unprecedented uncertain times, like we are, we are not adding to the plate at all.
Like no, no seconds, no thirds, you will eat what is on your plate and you will sit there patiently and say, you know what's coming next. Yes. Yeah. And it's so funny because, you know, even a month ago, if you had said we would be getting another dog, I would have laughed in your face.
And yet, clearly my heart wanted what my heart wanted in the universe said what it needed to say. And here it goes. And I am just thinking to Jay the many conversations that we had even just a couple months ago about the kind of the stress and the place you were at.
And I'm just so incredibly proud of the changes that are going to come because of the strength that you had to put it together. Like what you were going through is always hard. But it was the way that like this path is the right one for you. I don't want it to be all woo-woo.
 I mean, it definitely felt that way at the time because it was, there was like a very real moment of like anxiety and dread of like what if things aren't okay and I have to start like making more sacrifices or as I'm off to do start, you know, taking a torch to the candle at both ends of it and you know, putting myself in a position that I know brings burnout.
I think that the difference now is having just gone through that. There's still that that linger of, oh hey, you just had a pretty traumatic like few months where things were uncertain. And now you're about to go into another one even though sure it comes on, you know, the back of good news.
You still have to be prepared for whatever that transition is going to be like in reality.
Like I'm texting people, you know, today even just saying like, hey, what software am I going to be allowed to use? What's going to be okay? What's not going to be okay?
All of these little things that are going to bring disruption both, you know, very literally and like even mentally, like I'm going to have to change some of my hashtag systems and themes because I'm not going to be allowed to interact with some of the things that I do in the same way.
And these are all again, that invisible work that we don't think about when we make these changes. And I mean, all of this to say like I'm like while I'm excited, there is a high level of, you know, the demons, I don't know, Feta Chini. Are we there now? There's a lot of. A fiend's Feta Chini.
A fiend's Feta Chini, I love it. It's a moderation going. There's a lot that makes me want to curl up into a little corwawa ball and just be like, it'll be okay. You don't know what to expect, but you'll be fine.
And I think this is where we can take some of that imposter syndrome and turn it on its head of like even at my best, I feel like I can't do this. So in this moment, like I have a very valid reason to not to feel that way. Like it makes sense.
Well, and I think living in a world where it exists, you can be nervous and excited. You can be scared of what changes are going to be there and ready to take on the challenges. Like it doesn't have to be one or the other.
It can be this layer of and that will allow you to kind of do what you can to be ready. And still have butterflies in your stomach before you start. Yeah.
And I mean, again, if we're looking at this from, what do I do from a productivity standpoint? The first thing that we outlined was, hey, don't add new things. If it changes and when you have something big and new happening, adding things is probably not the way to go.
Taking more things away than what is required is actually probably one of the best routes. You know, I shut down my old podcast when we started conduit because I knew that in those like transitional periods, there was going to be a lot of things happening.
But also I didn't want the anxiety of having to decide where a thing went because I was doing a productivity show before.
It was like, why don't you do like the productivity stuff here and then do the productivity stuff here as well? Or be constantly like pointing back to the other thing that I'm doing.
It just made it easier to say, hey, in this moment where some things are going to have to go, let me see what else I can take away and create as much space and buffer for this exciting new period and this exciting new moment. Yeah. And that buffer built in is pretty darn great. So good job, you.
It's been helpful. It definitely has been helpful. I'm so excited for you and I can't wait to hear what your changes are going to, what changes are going to come like how you're going to do because of course you're going to be incredible. You're going to be amazing.
Obviously, they desperately wanted you and they might deserve you. I hope they deserve you because you're amazing. And I can't wait to hear how incredible your new job is. Well, I can't wait to hear what our connections are going to be out of this.
But before we do that, I think we have another sponsor we'd like to think. We do. This episode of Condo is also brought to you by CrowdStrike. Here's a scary fact for you. 70% of cyber attacks are targeted at small to midsize businesses.

And also something to add here that I don't think a lot of podcasters do. Thank you to our audience. We actually had one of our other sponsors decide to stay on because people actually were using it. That was like, what? That's also not so amazing.
So just so you know that when you are interested in those things and you use the links and all that stuff, like advertisers do see that and they support us, which is great. That's always a wonderful feeling to feel supported. Yes. In all of the ways, including our connections from our conductors.
Jay, wow, it's your show. I'm going to have you ask the questions. I'm sorry. Well, since my show, I will say, Kathy, what's your connection? So my connection is I'm going to make some way, some sort of way to visually track what my connection for the next fortnight is.
I even bought a whiteboard that is like the conversation bubble. I don't know where it is. It's somewhere in my office. So I should probably find it and put it up and that will be my connection. It might take two weeks to find, but we're on it. I'm sure we can we'll figure it out.
And if not, then hey, at least you'll have a new purchase to talk about. My connection is something that I want to expand on either in the next episode or in a feature episode or whatever. But I want to make a list of additions, subtractions and multiplications.
No divisions, though, that's kind of, I don't like that math. And what I mean by this is obviously in this changing time, new things are going to come, new things are going to go, or old things are going to go.
And this may be the right time to add something that is a quote unquote force multiplier into my system. There is, there's been tools that I've wanted to look at that I've said, you know, hey, in my existing job, it doesn't really make sense to invest in this.
But perhaps in this new role, it might make sense. Also looking at budget stuff, you know, hey, if I have a little bit more budget for things that are work related, maybe I can, I can work on that. But, you know, we'll see. And then I don't really know what that's going to look like at the moment.
But I definitely know that some things will be added, some things will go away, and some things will be added as a way to. Multiply the effect on some of the stuff that I'm already doing. Absolutely. And then we have some connections from our conductors as well.
Robert our conductor with no of the show of the show says next fortnight, be on time with my connection check. I love that one. That's a great, that's a great, great one. That's a good one. I like that.
Re-evaluate the theme journal and how to write it in a way that makes them think critically about what they're doing. Day to day for their theme. And finally, get a caterer booked for the wedding. Yay. Food and cake tasting time. Yes. Part of the wedding plan. Best part of the wedding plan. Bye.
I think I need to use that champagne lemon cake again, just to make sure. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. All right, our pathologist of the show, their connection for the next fortnight. She is to successfully move to her new apartment and keep in mind ways to set it up that will be kind to her ADHD brain.
Trash cans where she needs trash cans, basket where she needs basket. Obvious place for stuff she needs to take with her each day. Food she needs to use quickly at the front of the pantries and things. I love this.
Setting you up to succeed and be successful in ways that your brain will let you do it. That's amazing. And I'm super excited to see how this connection goes.
And then our tire advocate of the show, Chintas says, put things sufficiently back together this week so that they don't feel like they're leaving their colleagues in the lurch when they go on vacation next week. Plus one for vacation because vacation is good.
But also, again, Chintas, I love that you're very considerate, not just of your own personal and mental health going on vacation is always good, but also thinking about how that's going to affect your colleagues, which means that you're definitely a person that I would love to work with. Surprise.
You're right there, John. No, I'm just kidding. That would be fun. I don't even know where Chintas would be hilarious. That would be cool. My goodness. All right. Our Oracle of the show. So they need to finish the book in time for the deadline in 10 days.
That's ambitious enough for the next fortnight. Absolutely. And it's ambitious enough. But also you can do it 100%. You are going to do amazing. And I can't wait to see how it goes through.
And then our out of the show, Kate says that they want to make sure to relax over the weekend and give themselves a break. I am loving the mental health care in this episode. Yes. Oh my goodness. This is amazing.
I'm hoping to completely finish the report and make significant progress on the layout of the other document so that they know what is needed to 3D model and get images for the next and final deadline. Yes. You can do this. Yes. All right.
Our blue dragon of the show, Skylar, the flaggy flag rebel, who is rebelling with blue is the best color. Yes. Great. Coding is fun.
They have started some personal projects that they very much enjoy, but want to figure out the balance between doing what they like doing and doing what they need to do. I feel this deeply in my soul, this level of, um, okay, I'm going to do fun versus actually getting things done. Uh, I love that.
And I can't wait to hear what tricks you might have figured out. Maybe I can utilize them in my own life. And also to the dark Aqua dragon of the show, uh, please message me with your coding experiences. I would love to learn more and also see if I can help out in any way.
Next is our sloth of the show. Ankenu took the first steps towards finally getting the medical and mental health. Again, so much care towards mental health. Yes, we have the best audience. We have the best people connecting with us.
In the next fortnight, we'll follow up with a con and contact the recommended specialist to get that first console. Uh, amazing. All right. Our final connection for the next fortnight is from the guitarist that get guitarist of the show Scott. They are going to finish.
He, wow, we could tell we're at the end of the show. I'm doing great. I'm also there. Go meet him. He is going to finish setting up his recording desk so he can actually put that fancy new MacBook Pro to good use and record some music. I'm guessing with your guitar. Um, I can't wait.
I hope you share some of the music with us so that we can hear it and cheer you on. And I'm also hoping for, uh, check out in desk day so we can see your recording desk and see how awesome the setup looks. I love it.
Uh, so if you would like to submit a connection, you can do so on Twitter by tweeting at conduit FM using the hashtag hashtag my conduit or in the relay FM discord with the question mark my conduit and visit relay.fm slash conduit to become a member today.
Kathy, this has been great, but unfortunately I have some more, uh, turn over things to do before I look at my next role, which I will be announcing in the next episode.
So, uh, first I want to thank Devon Technologies and CrowdStrike for sponsoring this week's episode, but I have to ask Kathy, did we, did we do it? Heck yeah, we con did it.
