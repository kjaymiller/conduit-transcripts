 From Relay FM, you're listening to CondoEd, the show where we condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to CondoEd, the show that is definitely recorded every week, every fortnight in the same room. I'm Kathy and with me today is not my normal co-host Jay. Jay is off running around doing whatever it is that he's doing. Instead, we have a conductor whose name is nameless. In fact, I don't remember what his name actually is and that's okay because it's just nameless. Hi, nameless. Hello, Kathy. So happy that you are here for anyone that didn't listen to the pre-show or maybe doesn't know what the pre-show is. That's okay. We'll get to that later. Who are you? What do you do? Share with the listeners why we connected and why you're here. So I'm one of the superconductors for the community and I've been listening to CondoEd since episode zero. Which means it's a very long time ago. Yeah, that's been, I sent in a shout out a couple episodes ago saying how this show enthrac a lot of my adult life just because I could go back and say, I graduated from university on CondoEd episode this or I got married and it was CondoEd episode that or I got my master's degree. You got this job or that job and it's such a great part of my life now having this community to just kind of be a part of it. Like I love relay but I feel I'm not necessarily part of the relay community. I'm part of the CondoEd community. Which we absolutely adore you being a part of this community. Let's be honest. You are part of what makes it absolutely great and I'm so thankful that you're part of this and so thankful that you're hanging out with me today. Yeah, I'm very happy to be here. When you texted me during the co-working last week. Yeah, I just about fell out of my chair. The meme became the reality. I have joked around every time Jay leaves for travel and say just get one of the conductors to be part of be the co-host. And genuinely that was in me and I was not I was not buying eight Jay's chair or nothing but you told me I bought a ticket up to Portland and here we are. We're recording in the same room. Yep, exactly. Definitely, definitely 100% recording in the same room and having no technical issues whatsoever. Definitely. Yeah, we did not have to contact the suits. Nope, nope to fix the live stream. Nope, definitely not. Nope, no one knows. No one knows. Well, this past week in the discord has been a lot of fun as per usual. We've got a bunch of chaos going on including a discussion of starting a Friends Rewatch podcast where you call out all of the terrible you know, isms that happen. I feel like that might be a Roboism conversation mainly. But the my favorite thing that came out of it was the name of the podcast which would be we were on a hashtag break room. So well done, James for pulling that out. That was really that was that was great. I unfortunately have lots of memories around Friends growing up. It was a part of my college memories because it was live and we would fight with the survivor viewers to get the watch room because of course this was back when there was no streaming on the internet and we had to use real TV and all such sorts of old, old lady stories. But yeah, there's a lot of a lot of problems. But what? Problems with friends. Yeah. I have good memories with friends because this is one of my wife's favorite TV shows and she got me to start watching it during our engagement and into our first few years of marriage. And yeah, like we rewatched this show. A good amount at this point. It's one of my comfort shows now. Yeah. Yeah. And it's interesting. I feel like this could be a whole other conversation. Having a comfort show that you're able to still acknowledge the problems with it, but have the nostalgia for it. I feel like that's unique. But yeah, that's what happened in the discord and last week in co-working, it was a much more exciting day. Except Jay was driving while talking and had some concern. We had some concerns that he kept touching things. Even though Brittany was literally also in the car, we don't, Jay, we love you. Please don't die. I'm just going to leave that there. Jay, yes, don't do not think that was not. I was very concerned seeing all this. Yeah. It was traumatizing to sit and be like, okay, cool. I'm going to lose my co-host on a video call while he's getting his errands done. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think he had to go to a dentist appointment. I think that's where he was off to, but either way, it doesn't matter. Don't drive and touch your phone at the same time. But at least I will be driving with a car that works, which is great. Anyone that like was in the co-working or heard the story or anything, I had a terrible week two weeks ago where my car transmission died, my furnace stopped working and my fridge was leaking. Oh no. Yeah, it was not good, but we saged the house and ourselves and things were working much better. So that's good. And I have a new car. And it is an electric mini-cooper. And I love it so much. And I'm super excited. Have you given it any? Yes. Her name is Iced and I. Because I'm a nerd and from the Wheel of Time. And I will be having custom plates that say green aja and yeah, she's great. I love her. It's fun. But if you would like to join us for our next co-working session where we do, in fact, actually get work done too, it happens in the off weeks with myself and Jay and. And myself. And and nameless is there most of the time too. It's fantastic. If that sounds fun or if you want to listen live while we're recording in the discord, you can become a member by visiting I am a superconductor.com to become a member today. I letter I letter M letter a superconductor.com. All right. It's time for that one good thing. Nameless, what's one good thing that happened? It is finally not hot in Vegas. Woo. I didn't realize that actually happened. Like during the fall season, suddenly and violently, the heat goes away all at once, typically preceded by a rain shower, which is also rare in Vegas. And it is actually currently raining outside my house, which is very rare. I'll actually just stop. I just felt though the sun. But we went from mid 80s, high 70s to today being a high of 59. And we are going to stay below that below the 70 threshold, I think for the remainder of the year, which is my favorite part of the year because I get to bring out my sweaters and my cardigans and all of my comfy clothes. Yeah. And along with that, my puppy becomes a lot more cuddly because she runs hot and does not like to cuddle because she's just a note that you're a furnace. But now that it's cold, she gets to cuddle. I love that's the other bonus about when you're working from home during co-working sessions is we get to see Mocha. I love Mocha. I love her so much. Well, you're one good thing, Kathy. My good thing is getting external validation by people that matter. Now, I phrased it this way very particularly, not for the indication that everyone else, that all people don't matter. Like everyone matters. Yada, yada, yada. I was in Prague this past weekend for about 36 hours, lucky enough to visit a Wheel of Time exhibition of costumes, that the incredible costume designer Sharon put together, 86 costumes from the Wheel of Time were put out in this gallery and showcased and it was just an incredible event. I'm so thankful that I went. I snuck into the press event that was done for the local Prague press community. And then the next day, I also hung around during, so I could film a little something with Sharon so that we could promote kind of what the exhibition is for because there were some missed opportunities with a promotion team that she was working with. And I was like, hey, I have this passion, I have this knowledge, I have this platform. Let me come here and do something to help. I'm already here. I'm not going to, I don't need any sort of compensation. Just like, let me help you get this be as popular as possible. And in doing so that second night, I happened to kind of invite myself along to the cast and crew opening party thing that they had. And in doing that, I had like one of the directors of season two and season three that did four episodes total came up to me. I had never met her in person. I had never interviewed her. I had never done any of that. She came up and said, oh my gosh, Kathy, it's so nice to finally meet you. I love your work. Can I have a hug? And I was like, yes. Kind of got a little emotional. A couple other people that I had met before was like, oh my gosh, hi, hi, Kathy. So good to see you. Type of a thing. They knew my name. I didn't have to remind them about it. And that just kind of is weird. And then the show runner, Rafe Judkins came in with his partner Taylor, who is also one of the actors on the show. And I got to actually meet him in person, get a hug, et cetera. And we were sitting there talking and somebody from the crew came up and started talking to Rafe. And Rafe introduced me to him by name and called me the number one fan and community. And I just about melted into a puddle. And I was like, here's this validation from people that clearly the Wheel of Time is as important into their lives as well. And they are happy with what I've been doing, which I don't always need it. You know, I'm very, I'm for the most part, content and happy with what I'm doing in my life and the projects that I'm providing and doing. And that kind of hit, hit my heart in a really, really special way that I'm just so thankful for. Yeah, it's super amazing when you get that validation from people who not only matter to you, but they know you that you don't feel like it's that fake. Yeah. Yeah. Genuine. And it's not even typically something so big is just a fit. I see you. Yeah. Just knowing that you've been seen and because often we do so much work for these things that we're passionate about. Yeah. There's something really special about being seen in a way that people kind of have the same glasses that you're wearing, like being able to see through their lens and through the lens that you're seeing yourself. And I highly recommend it. Yes. All right. What about your connection check? Connection check. I actually forgot my original connection when you sent me all the invitation. I just completely forgot as that I need to go and prepare for this episode because I do not want to cause Kathy more work by being on here. So I yellow for my original connection, whatever that was, but I think green for preparing for this episode. Yeah. That's great because it's important to, you know, it's okay to change your episode. It's okay to, nope. Let's try that again. Connection. It's okay to change your connection, especially when stuff happens. And really I should have changed my connection because of the chaos that happened over these past two weeks, but I didn't. So I am giving myself an X because I did not load the products into Shopify. And guess what? That's also okay. Because again, the chaos of my life made it to where that didn't happen. And I'm okay with that. And okay, there's nothing necessarily wrong with not successfully finishing something like that. And that's okay. Let's go through our conductors. Are you ready for this name list? I am ready. There is so many more buttons on this side of the show. I know. It's stressful. There's buttons and switches. No wonder Jake keeps breaking the spreadsheet. Right. So push that button on the right and we'll get to the connections. And we'll start with our checklist enthusiasts of the show Mike, who says previous connection, yellow heart. Start working on the outdoor lounge. I'm working on turning our screened-in room into an all seasons room for entertainment and relaxation. Only got as far as throwing out trash in that room. Still need to do some prep work before I can start doing the flooring. Hey, that is a great, great start. And to me, it sounds like you were successful in starting, which in my opinion is a green heart, but that's okay. Either way. Next we have the of the show. A connection check. Heart. I was sick and my connection was to get better. I actually got worse. Oh no. And I'm currently in the hospital, but I am going in the right direction, apparently. That is hopefully all gets better soon. Yes. Keep us updated. Presenting you good thoughts. I feel very bad about making that the screen before this. No, I had a text, Mrs. Nameless, and tell her, I'm going to scream. Everything is fine. Smart. Always good to warn. Always good to warn. She might be asleep. Oh no. Oh no. Oops. Oops. Hopefully you're going to wake her up. Hopefully not. I'm on the other side of the house. Okay. Good. Good. Yeah. And in the in the discord, it did give permission to do pets. So that's good. I'm sure that it will be appreciated. I did see that. Good. Good. Our profane sleeper of the show mic says connection check six hearts. I've been able to set aside dedicated time to relax and step back from all the hustle and bustle going on with my wife's treatments. I got to play an actual game this week. That is great. Caregiving is a marathon, not a sprint. And so putting that time into taking care of yourself is really, really important. Yes. The soprano of the show, Debo connection check yellow heart showed showed some vacuuming options to my husband who does 95% of the vacuuming and waited and waiting for him to weigh in on his preferences before I order. Oh vacuum, not vacuuming options. See it's hard. It is hard. I am sorry, Jay, for making fun of you. But that's great, Debo. Just having options, I know that's something that for me I always wrestle with just, oh, there's this. And then there's that. And then there's the other. But just being able to get here are three great options. Pick the one you like the best or a handful of great options. Pick the one you like the best. That helps me and I'm pretty sure your husband would appreciate that. And hopefully you get that new vacuum soon. Yeah. Absolutely. Perfect. All right. So short connections for you this time. Let's dive into the topic. If you listened to the pre show, we went through all of the four incredible topic ideas that nameless put together. But this episode we're going to be talking about productivity inside systems that you don't control. The problem with the world a lot of times is that there's other people involved in decisions and choices and the way stuff happens. And that's really difficult. And how do you navigate that? So yeah, nameless, how did this come about? What made you think of this topic? So something I was talking about in the pre show was that I have always been in a position whether it be in school or at work or in ministry that I am given the responsibility of stepping in front and the way that I have mentally thought of this for myself is that I've always been so journey ahead of everyone else in the areas that I'm passionate about. It's not necessarily that I have been burdened with this. It's just that. There has never been a, for example, in school, I have always been part of production. I've loved everything to do with production from tech theater to video production, audio production. And I was always part of the first or second classes where these programs were getting lifted off. And because I had access to production due to ministry as well, I was often. Like after the teacher, the most experienced person in the room. So if I was given the choice, I would make different choices. But never have I been in the position where I got to make 100% of the choices. Right. Though, how do you make a space for yourself inside of those systems where you, you might be the person that they lean on, but you're not the person who gets to say, who gets the final say on what goes where and how do you navigate that? How? Because we can silo ourselves and say, well, that's how everyone else works. And this is how I work. And that works to an extent. But what happens when someone's coming up behind you and you have to train someone to do what you're doing? Yeah. So those are the things that make it difficult, especially now with the work that I'm doing now. I'm a knowledge manager at the company that I work at. I'm a jobee job. And the big thing that I'm currently doing is uncovering those silos and saying, yes, that is great that you get more done than anyone else. But what happens when you leave or you're sick? Yeah. And I can't rely on your back network of systems because the day that you are no longer able to keep doing this work, it falls apart. And it's something that I've realized in my own life that the day I want to take a break, it's so much more difficult for everyone else because of the systems that I, that I in the past have refused to integrate into. So it's all those things coming into collision with one another plus the maturity. And then in some areas now being the person, like now I have the option of saying, hey, this is what we're doing. This is how we're going to do it. And now that I get the decision, the option to make those decisions, what used to seem like the obvious choice no longer looks as good because it's not just for me anymore. Right. Yeah. There's something unique about how to frame, how to get things done, not trademarked, where other people are involved because the second that you add a second person, let alone third, fourth teams, however many people are in a company or working on a thing, it becomes exponentially more difficult because no one can read minds. It's just not the one that you add on the trip or your choices. Yeah. Absolutely. You come into this with layers of biases with layers of history, with layers of knowledge, with all of these pieces that make it so incredibly complicated to the point where it doesn't, it almost doesn't matter what you, the way that you want to do it, it becomes a way that you have to do it for other people. That other people are involved, which means it cannot be the way, exactly the way that you want to do it, because if you do it the way that only you want it and don't take into account anything else, you are going to lose plain and simple. It's just not, it's just not, it's not a good idea. And unfortunately, I'm very familiar with this type of a thing. This is what I do a lot of times with my clients, is that I'm working with the systems that they have, and I use systems very loosely, lowercase s, because anything that you do, the way that you do it is a system whether or not it's recorded. So if you do something more than once, it becomes a system. Again, it doesn't have to be written down. It's still a system. It's still a standard operating procedure, all of these things. And so part of what I do is really helping to figure out what the system that people want to get done looks like versus how they're actually doing it and how to kind of make that work together, I guess. And that's really difficult when you have somebody that doesn't necessarily know how to make it work for other people or expects it to be done the way that they want it without taking into account any of that information. And so the idea of being able to still use the structure in place, but tweak it to make it work for you is pretty powerful in when working with other people. And so that's a good mindset to have is how to work within this, but still be able to be successful. Yeah. And the big thing for myself is learning when to say no to you, especially when you're in the opportunity, you're in the seat because when you can make the choices, it's very easy to say, well, this is what I love. So this is what we're going to use. Yeah. So in that's what like, for example, my preferred like app, my favorite app, honestly, right now, is craft. I love it for almost everything I do. All of my lessons are in craft. All of the notes I have are in craft. I wouldn't want to call it project management, but my people management is in craft. Yeah. Everything I can throw in there, I is in there. And for me, like the big reason is because of the sharing as a website. Okay. I don't have to tell anyone else download this app. Buy this app, pay for these things. I just tell him, here's, oh, here's what I did. And I send them a link in the website. And everyone knows what a website does. Right. So. And it also makes me look very professional when I send to people. Oh, you need the schedule for the conference. Here you go. Here's the website. And it's this super professional looking thing because it's online. Oh, that we, that conference got pushed 10 minutes. Okay. The whole schedule is getting pushed up five, five, 10 minutes now. And it updates. It's such a unique use case that I have for it as a result. That gives me so much power on the back end because, because of that one thing, like, for example, I share my curriculum to my leaders to my leadership team. And I'll make a rough outline for a year. And I will then link into it all of the individual lessons. And as they come about, I'll share to the relevant people those lessons. But everyone who has access to that master document knows the vibe. They know what direction we're heading to with this. They know what's like what's going on. It's not no one's running blind, but also no one needed the app. Yeah. And I feel like especially for, you know, quote, unquote, lay people, people that aren't, you know, huge tech nerds and stuff. They don't want to feel like they're not able to do what they need to do or feeling overwhelmed or frustrated already to just start with what they're doing. Yeah. The less friction you give them to do the work that they are volant because often I'm working actually I only work with volunteers in that area. Yeah. In my team, I am the only person who is employed by the ministry. So actually, no, that is incorrect. I work with one other employee directly within the teams that I manage. But even then, like, it's for neither of us, this is this our full-time job. It's just we are giving this incredible privilege to also do this. Yeah. And get paid for it. So I want to make sure that everyone on my team has as much material as possible so that they're able to not, like, like I said, I've always been at that position where I'm so journey ahead of everyone else. And I want to give them the tools and opportunity to do the things that I have never had to do in a way like thinking how a parent would, like, I didn't have this, so I want to give it to you. Yeah. And these tools help me do that. But I can't tell all of my team, okay, when it comes to creating documents and lessons and everything lives in this craft space and everything you will do is in craft. Because they don't all have the same technology level as I do. I have my phone and I know how to navigate it as a computer. I have my iPad. I know how to navigate it as a computer. I have my laptop. I know how to navigate it as a computer. And that's like the key operating phrase for the way I look at volunteers is, yes, you have this technology. Can you operate it at this level? Yeah. Because you can have a Mac studio and the best display. But you might not know how to use it. Yeah. If you can't plug it in, then it doesn't matter what you have. Because it's not, it's not going to work. And when you're working with a mixture of people from different backgrounds, because when you're working at my work, we all have the same floor when it comes to tech technology. We all have the same computer. We all have similar baseline skills. It's very easy for the company to then turn around and say, these are the apps we're using, you have to know them. And okay, to fair game, because that's why we got hired. But when you're working with volunteers, that is not something you can always say. Right. Because everyone comes from a different, a different level of privilege. So a kid, and even when you have the privilege, the privilege doesn't necessarily, what's the word I'm looking for? True. My English went away. And I have unfortunately, I can't even figure that out. Your level of privilege does not necessarily qualify you. Mm. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because you can, like I said, you can have the best technology, but you might not be capable. Yeah. So what do you do then? Because those are the things I'm trying to balance. So when I'm in the room where the decisions are made, I have to account for not necessarily the lowest common denominator, but the lowest common place of training. I am capable of getting anyone to. Yeah. And that comes in with considerations of time, of my own ability, and availability. Yeah. Yeah, there's so many. This is all so complex. Again, I feel like we've said this already. You add another person, and it's difficult. But then you have this whole company too. And the need for people to be able to access and see what you're doing to help contribute to that, and hope that they are able to understand and manage and access that. So you don't have a challenge point that makes it more difficult than it needs to be. And there's a lot of assumptions that are built in that. I feel like it can be difficult to maybe overcompensate to try and make it too simple or expect someone to not understand it at all. And I think it's important to make sure that you have a good balance on that. That you're like, okay, I know I'm going to ask permission to kind of get that find out what they don't know so I can help them. Or manipulate and maneuver your system within the system and make it work, I think. Yes. And like I laugh because that's exactly where my mind had to go when it comes to these kind of things because the easy thing is to then throw away your system for the sake of someone else's. Yes. And that's so unhealthy. Yeah, because you already know this system works for you. You already know this is how your brain operates and this is how you get your brain to work. So when you are trying to copy the system that's in place, you lose what makes you the reason that you were put in this room to begin with. Yes. And that's super dangerous because one for job security, if you act just like everyone else, what stops them from getting someone else? Yeah. Someone cheaper. Yes. And there's a reason that you were picked and that's that's like a big thing that for me has been it's been my personal encouragement because I just started this new role. And there has been moments where I am thinking how did I fool everyone that I can do this? Yes. But I keep reminding myself, there's a reason that you were selected. Yes. You can talk really well about all of these things, but if they didn't genuinely think you could do it. If you didn't genuinely think you could do it, you would have never made it into this room. You would have stayed on the outside waiting for an opportunity to come and fall in your lap. That is perfect. Yes. For the next thing to happen, you have to grow, you have to change the opportunities, don't land because you're ready. The opportunities prepare you and push you into a higher level of development. And when we are thinking that I have to be like this or like that, it severely limits what it is that you're going to be able to produce because you are not trying to let your voice shine. So where do you land in the middle within this? Because you don't control the whole system. And if you silo yourself, then it's just the same level of insecurity that you create. Because then no one knows what you're doing. No one knows what's happened. So no one can vouch for you. No one can hold you. No one can say when you're fear held to the fire, yes, this person has done it for real. It's not, it's not entered a magic box and come out. They all see it. Right. Like we don't want to throw those situations here. Yes, yes, let's not. Let's not. And where do we land in that middle? How do you make, how do you carve out? And like how for me, it's been, it's how do I carve out a space that is me? Without it being hidden behind a curtain. And that is something that's incredibly difficult. Yeah, absolutely. I get that a lot with what I do. Most of my clients and stuff, I work with what systems that they use, what programs they use, what they need as a client to succeed. And that usually means I have to do things that are not the way that I would normally want to do them, shall we say, or my innate, oh, this is how it should go type of a situation. You had to buy a whole PC for one of your clients. Right. Well, no, to be fair, they bought it for me because I wasn't going to buy a PC for someone else that needed it. So like this is their, you know, I have a work computer owned by a company for the first time in a fair, long time. And it's still taking some getting used to. But yes, I have to use in order to do the job that I need to do in order to get the access that I need, I have to use a PC. And so this topic in particular is really, really hits home because it's about what can I do to make it work for me. And in doing that, I have, you know, my Ducky keyboard, the first keyboard that I built together, thanks to the help of hashtag keyboards in the discord that I did it on live with Mike. That is connected to the laptop so that I don't have to touch the keys of a Windows keyboard, which is a little bit, it's all a little bit different, like the placement of the enter key, like the backspace, all of the things are different enough that it breaks my back. There's no command button. No, no command. I, the control works. But it's, it's, you know, using the pinky instead of the thumb to do like command C command V versus control C control V. Use your thumb to hit control. Yeah. Use my index finger. Interesting. Because I do, yeah. And now I'm like, that's, yep, that's what I do. Because I'll do the thumb for the command. And then I'll, I'll use my index finger for whatever other key I'm using. I'm clicking. Do I click? Oh my, I do, I do the exact, I am ashamed of myself. I hit index control thumb C thumb V. Interesting. That's so funny. I love, I love how different everyone is. When I'm thinking it's like, thumb makes sense, but also middle finger or ring finger would make more sense, given a home row. Yeah. And now I'm wondering, I, I, you will understand this reference, but this is like mumbo jumbo shift thumb on shift. If anyone understands that, yay. When we're done recording, I'm definitely going into, into the keyboards channel and we're going to do a survey. We're going to do a poll and see how, who's right. Quote and quote, right. Obviously with the understanding that however you do it is the right way. But now I'm really curious. There's going to be some burgo people who are going to throw it all off first. I don't, I don't, I can't wait. It's going to be great. It's going to be great. I have a hot key that's control C and control V on my third layer. Oh, interesting. That was a meme. That was not me saying, because yeah, that would be super cool. That would be very cool. And I have macros on my keyboard because I have the keycron. I think it's the Q1. The one that got really popular during the pandemic. Oh, yeah, yeah. I don't have the knob on it, but I have that one. And so like I have a whole row of optional macros. I have my Pomodora timer on there. I actually do not even remember what macros three and four do. They have cool pictures. Well, don't find out right now. No, I am not coming. I might just like throw my computer somewhere. Yeah. Yeah. You can see the keyboard right here. We're right in the same space. Yes. Yes. Of course. I mean, obviously I could see you pushing those buttons to make sure that you are not doing it wrong. Oh, my goodness. Amazing. Yeah. So I think the biggest thing is when this problem comes up is making sure that you know the pieces that can't change. Know, you know, whether it's the tools or a specific format of something or anything, anything like that. But being able to keep your personal style or adding something that you might need to add in order to make it work for your brain. I think being able to manipulate or adjust the way something is done over time can be helpful. But when you start, it's really important to know why it exists the way that it does in order to better understand what you are able to change or adjust without breaking the systems for other people. That's actually what I've had to learn. My connection, a couple, I think it was last conduit, was I'm looking into training because I want to know why certain systems were selected. And I appreciate how much that threw Jay for a little bit. Because that was my first my first gut reaction was, okay, so we are operating under a KCS system. We've selected Salesforce because it is KCS compliant. Okay, I've worked within KCS systems before, but no one ever brought up Salesforce as an option. Yeah. That was never even an idea. Like it wasn't idea CD, it wasn't even down to Z. So why was that what makes this platform unique other than the fact that we already have it? Because if we're going to put in all this effort to to make this work, why not also just flip platforms at the same time? Yeah. The effort already being done on a level on like an efforts chart, is it such a shake, such so much more to switch platforms? And as I've been going through the, it's not training yet, but just having conversations around people who have this understanding, it's making more and more sense because the underlying foundation makes it, it makes it simpler to implement the, the philosophy of knowledge that we're trying to implement. Because of, because everything is going to be able to be pulled very easily within a system that exists, part of the reason, yeah, is we have it and it's working good enough for now. But when we add the philosophy on top of it, it'll, it'll give us that extra, that we're looking for when it comes to these things, making the overall searching for knowledge simpler as a result. Yeah. And in my mind, it was, let's burn the ships. Which is not necessarily a good way to do it. I was a good plan when we're from the place where the idiom comes from. I don't think it'll ever be a good plan. No, that's true. That's, that's, that's a very good point. I had, I remember, so when I was pregnant with MiniSoup, I was a project manager for a technology company. And before going on maternity leave, they transitioned, transitioned me over into like front desk, um, secretary type vibe with the knowledge that I'd come back into a project management. When I got back from maternity totally fine, not a problem. Um, so I was training my replacement. And I had a massive issue that I look back now and I see why I had this like visceral reaction because she came in and just started making changes without knowing why things were done the way that they were done. Now in this instance, like, I don't care if you do something different, that's fine. Make those changes, make it work for you. You're in charge. Yadda, yadda, yadda. The problem that I had was the fact that she didn't understand why and how things were done, which meant the rest of our team, that was no longer my team anymore, but the rest of her team were confused and afraid to say anything because she was now in charge. But also steps started getting missed because that system was just switched without like a transition period. And I had a really, really deep, deep negative reaction to that, um, which I clearly it's been, you know, 16 years and I'm still angry about it. What it's fine. So yeah, honoring and understanding the history of something is important for the people that put the energy and work into it, but also so that you're not missing important pieces of it because that can happen is that if you go in willy-nilly and just make changes, you're not going to understand nuance and stuff will get lost and can possibly burn down and we don't like that. Yeah, it's, it's exactly what we're trying to avoid and it's part of that idea of what happens then like when we are in that position where we're creating all of these systems for ourselves, what then when we turn around when we're trying to then like in your situation train someone, how can we actually give them a level of context because like if you throw them in to the deep end, they're going to look at your system and say why is everything on stilts? Yeah. Why like there's better way, there are better ways, but the better way does not mean that, that's always it. The better way for one person will make it so that no one else can do it. Yes. And the better way for this situation right now may not even actually be the real better way. It's just the way that you think it's the better way because you don't understand or realize that the reason that something has been done the way that it's been done is because of this reason. Yes. And it's as like the person who's in the front, how do you give those people enough nuance and context to be able to walk in the same direction that you've been walking? And give them the opportunity and freedom to express their voice at the level that you have scratched out for yourself. Yes. Because that's like the last like piece that I've had to learn for myself is if you make a system that works for you within someone else's tools and it gives you your voice but mutes everyone else's. You've caused the same issue again. Yes. So you're going to make the person coming in behind you or the people who are under you have to fight to do what you've already done. And ultimately you become the part of the problem instead of the solution. Yes. Agreed. Agreed 100%. Oh my goodness. Going on this because there's so many layers of it's an onion. There's so many layers. Yes. So many layers. But you have an appointment to get to. And so let's actually can push forward that that actually got pushed forward. Okay. Okay. So we have more time. Then expect it. Perfect. But still this was great. I loved this conversation. We're going to this is the perfect time to wrap it up though. And let's get to our connections for next time. Yes. Connections. We never said is that we stop seeing app at some point in the show. Yeah. Yeah. I do it every so often when the zap is felt when it's deeply, deeply felt and it needs to come out. But not today apparently. Not today. Unfortunately. Yes. What is your connection for next time? So I have two parts. I have a end of year events with my ministry that we're doing. And we want to make it special for all of the kids who are part of the ministry. So we're making it like invitations so that they don't just feel like come this day like always. And that we're giving them invitations and making all this extra effort into it so that they feel the caring love that the team has for them. And part of that is it needs to get printed because it's physical material. Digital materials. Great. Love it. Physical material makes you feel a little bit more warm and fuzzy analog tools, pens, paper, all of the jazz. So I need to get that stuff printed so that we can give it to the kids and they can feel that love but also it goes with the vibe. Yeah. And along with that, I'm also just going to keep chugging away at the curriculum for next year so that I do not give myself a mountain of work come January. Love it. Yes. Good plan. I am actually going to load the products now. Again, it needs to happen. I got to got to do it. And so now I'm actually going to do it. Knock on wood that I'm not going to be having any more housing things explode and we'll get that done. Have no wood near me so I can't go away. This is wood. Well, my desk is wood so I'll I've got it covered. I've got it covered. Great. All right. So our tech podcast listener of the show Pillex says from last episode, we said tire and now he remembered he needed to order new winter tires for the new car. So yeah, that's going to be part of my next connection. Good luck, Pillex. At that done before the snow gets to hear it. Yes. Yes. The checklist, enthusiasts of the show Mike says new connection start working on my new yearly theme for 2026. I already did a little bit of the groundwork, but need to pick a name goals, etc. Love it. That is great work to get ahead. I've always found that for me when I start really fleshing out the philosophy of the theme, the name just kind of throws itself. Yeah. Yeah, agreed. And I need to start thinking about my theme for next year or two. Good to know. I need to order my new journal. Middle of November. Uh, speaking of the uh, the uh of the show, uh, says new connection. Rest. I'm on medical leave. So my whole job is to relax and get better. Yes. Please relax and get better so I can scream in your face at some point. Be better. Uh, because we all we're all hoping for you to have a quick recovery. Yes. Yes. The profane. Oh, let's try that one again. The profane sleeper of the show Mike get through the Thanksgiving holiday and black Friday slash Cyber Monday without spending too much. Yes. Yes. Well, they already started. I know that's the crazy thing. Is that every year they keep getting earlier and earlier and yeah, and and less and less impressive discounts. If black Friday is not on a Friday, it is no longer black Friday. It's cheap. It's true. That's that's real. That's real. Uh, our soprano of the show, Deb O says next connection. Try to do as little as possible during our week off for Thanksgiving. We love a resting connection. Fantastic.
