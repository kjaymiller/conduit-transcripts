From RelayFM, you're listening to Conduit. The show we Condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Condu it. The show that starts when it starts and that's how it starts because it started in the middle of boarding. This episode is brought to you by Marker.Blog. I'm Jay.
I will be your pilot and with me is the other person that will be your pilot. The wonderful Kathy Campbell. Hi Kathy. Hello Jay. The exits are forward and after and check behind you because they may be behind you. I am clearly not a flight attendant.
Put on your mask before you let other people put on your mask. I mean wow. Kathy what happened this week in the discord? Oh my gosh.
So just today something very dramatic happened and we in the hashtag break room channel we discuss well other people had conversations about making coffee with something other than water.
Orange juice was options a variety of other things including the fact that someone's coffee had tomato notes to which which we learned is possibly because the beans were from Kenya. Kenya apparently has a taste of tomato so that is something that I learned this week in the discord.
As someone who drinks a lot of coffee from the African continent especially from Kenya and Ethiopia. I don't know if I've ever recognized tomato as a note but I wouldn't like not say that either.
Yeah and then last week in the amazing superconductor co working session we had an amazing talk about how bougie all of us are. It was it was hashtag privilege hashtag sports hashtag. We need the suits to hurry up and get that private jet ready for us. Yes please.
 But yeah before we jump into this week's topic a special one for the both of us shout out to go to my favorite baseball team as I will get to my connection later so spoilers I guess we went to go see my favorite baseball team which is now my daughter's favorite baseball team and we won because we're the best.
And yeah so I yeah shout out to them shout out to a great night at Peco Park. Are you going to say what your favorite baseball team knows because I already got enough hatred from. I'm an Atlanta Braves fan yes name yes questionable decision making all around.
They are still my favorite baseball team and have been for my entire life. What about you Kathy. Yeah my shadow goes to Panda of the show James Thompson for taking a task off of my plate that it didn't take much time.
And it didn't take much energy to do but it's something that I had on my calendar to do since the first of April today's April 18th just so you know. I clearly needed help it probably didn't take very long.
It just was you know adding people to a specific slack channel and I mentally was blocked and so James came in and saved the day and now we can do the planning that we need to do so thank you James.
So what you're saying is it just takes some time little girl year in the middle of the ride everything everything will be just fine everything everything will be all right all right. Connection checks. What was your connection Kathy. That's that.
So my connection was to try and bring calm and peace to the studio dancers doing our championships. I think we did a really good job I had help with my roommate other dance mom parent who was able to take care of my kid and like.
I had to be there early both days for other teams to take their photos and stuff and so this other mom took care of mini soup and like took them around to describe and discover the town.
They got beads for hair they bought books they got treats including very expensive drinking chocolate like six dollars for an ounce and of course they loved it. Six dollars you better love it yeah right right and it really helped them stay calm and collected.
Even though the solo that they performed was definitely not their best performance because the one thing that we did was forget to make them eat protein like a protein boost beforehand or carbs any of that they had an eaten a whole lot.
So their energy was really low and out of 18 people they still got sixth place we were not expecting them to place at all because it was not their best performance and so I'm so proud of how well that they did.
And then their team got first in one of their dances which was incredible and I'm so proud of them for that. That is awesome congratulations to the team and great job Kathy for keeping them cool.
My connection was to have a daddy daughter day or a day with my daughter I I should have modified this and said like my my wife is like invited to also join in on the festivities.
 It was just something out of the ordinary something to get us out of out of the house something to make memories and things like that again we went to a baseball game I've been really trying to keep up with baseball more this year and I've been watching my favorite team like every day like it's become like part of the ritual that I have of you know just part my whole my whole day day by day stuff.
And they were in town and since you know I'm going to be traveling soon or in my soon I mean tomorrow. It was like everything just kind of lined up to be like oh we're going to this game and I guess for some other context my daughter had been to a baseball game before.
 But she'd gone to a minor league game I don't know if you for those that don't know minor league baseball is probably one of the most fun experiences for kids because the audiences are a little small but because of that they do a lot more stuff to try to encourage people to come out to the ball the ballpark so they wind up like doing like kids races on bases and they give out like prizes stuff in the mascots run around the stands and hang out with the little ones.
I think she was expecting that as well. Oh no. For a major league game with several thousand people there. That was not the case she was like it's very loud. We got her some headphones and then after that she had a great time still but. Good.
Yeah shout out like and shout out to the team we won but yes I did make sure that we had a special day out the whole family. We had seats right along the third baseline so you could see everything it was absolutely amazing and 10 out of 10 would park again. What about our con doctors.
Starting with our shark of the show Chris connection check I restructured my task management system to accommodate the extra complexity associated with working on multiple projects across three time zones. That's incredible.
I would love to hear some follow up and and kind of what you did and definitely not because I'm looking I need to change things up but yes that's also what I'm asking for because I have.
It doesn't matter that's not the thing we're concentrating on you Chris great job congratulations I'm super proud of you. Our fish bear of the show fish guy says I had two projects where I was waiting on someone else one turns out I didn't need to do it all. So I'm taking the W.
Hey I like that sometimes sometimes you win by not participating. The other person got back sooner than I thought but the project wrapped up when I wanted to anyway so mostly green again I think wins all around. Yeah that sounds like it's all agreeing to me.
Our Oracle of the show so says connection check yellow heart I wanted to meditate three times a week but I only managed twice in total but they were very nice meditation sessions on the beach I think that gets double points. So I'm proud of you for giving yourself the yellow heart because you did.
Like meditate so that's awesome. I almost said meditation. That's not the right thing. No no no. Our mountain dweller of the show looking says I missed posting it last week yellow square by a couple hours but my connection was get everything ready for electrical and plumbing inspections.
That's right we're on house house updates. I finished 86 out of 90 outlets and switches. And all the overhead lighting but still have a sink and a toilet left I'm pretty sure you're good. Like it's okay if we got a little bit left that's a lot and way to go getting all that stuff done.
Plus I think there's a very good chance that you do you could do the last four before the show goes out. It two days from now so that pressure on low gain I know I know but I'm saying you could easily get that green check mark the low gains. That's the rolling in the mountains.
That's true that's very true distracted by the sunset I get it I get it. Our identical twin of the show Aaron says connection check green check mark ran close to 22 kilometers since the last conduit episode.
Thanks for the extra push well thank you for giving us any sort of acknowledgement for your amazing connection. Great job. Oh slot for the show on can you say connection check life pulled me aside for about checks for months I was going to say it's been it's been a while.
Oh we've got to try we don't do that anymore because that person's a horrible person man lot of song references that I have to go and check on now. But I've caught back up with conduit I think my last connection in January was the straight nut my home office and hobby space.
And I did it hey way to go I love that those back to being cluttered up. Oh no I was painted such still green check for that long forgotten fortnight. That's okay way to go and we're glad to have you back and glad to have you back on the train.
Listen you're a sloth it's okay sometimes it takes a little bit longer you only have three. I mean I think I don't think all sloths have three toes since there's one specifically called the three-toed sloth and I feel like that means that it would be different.
Then they would have two toes and well I know but I feel like they're I listen what I'm saying is I need to know how many toes a quote a quote normal sloth slash other sloth has that makes a breed of sloth a three-toed sloth.
I almost I almost so yeah on can you send us send us some feedback how many to the official sloth. As an official sloth of the show we need this feedback.
Our nameless of the show robber says connection check green circle went for walks did not find ducks unfortunately I'm sorry the feud with us PS is finally finally over with them now delivering the mail to my mailbox congratulations. We will cancel the parade practice then.
The show rails he says green multiple symbols I began writing a daily well I began writing daily to do list for me a strong improvement from finding what to do it's not consistent but it's getting better.
Hey I you know we're going to be talking about how some of our stuff is going to change up just because of where we are so I think trying new things and seeing what works and letting that slowly progress over time is kind of the right way to go.
Yes agreed our panda of the show James says connection check green check mark I have been relatively good and not stressing out too much and have read many books in the last two weeks.
I have even booked a flight to distance shores for a top secret event top period secret period again hey suits get this get the jet ready come on get the jet come on get the jet.
And then our code monkey of the show programmers says connection check yellow square kind of sort of halfway stuck to the system got to do better hey it's called progress and you made it yes and you just got to keep making it and then you did it.
Then you did better there you go that's how you do progress for the programmer oh no sponsor.

I hope I was hoping you could do it for the next week and a half i mean who's who's going to keep the show running with all this traveling how how is the unicorn blessing going to be well blessed. yeah especially because fun fact i'm going to see three out of four. Of my unicorns all together.
Also shout out that as the chat is like i volunteer. i hope i'm like so this tribute yay so many great great volunteers but no we're still here.
So yeah and in the last co working session all of our all of our bougie talk came from the acknowledgement that both of us are in unprecedented instances traveling at the same time to different places and they lined up pretty well so.
Because we're both really really busy people and we do a bunch of wild things in our day to day with our joby jobs in our hobby hubs and. I don't think that's a thing but.
I thought it would be kind of cool if we talked a little bit about how do we how do we keep the pace and how do we keep things going do we keep things going.
While we travel and Kathy I guess you can kick it off like what are you planning on doing while not not in a tinder or anything but what are you planning on doing to keep yourself. Or keep the momentum going while you're away.
yeah so the nice thing is is I have open communications with all of my clients so they all know that i'm traveling.
 So I there's a couple clients that like I check emails for and I do some sort of like that client triage stuff so I've let them know hey it's going to take like i'm only doing this like once or twice a day depending on what day of the week it is like Friday nobody not many people email on a Friday so i'm good with you know sending it out like only doing one day.
But the so the biggest thing is communication I mean honestly that's the biggest part for any of this but then also making sure that you. Really are only doing the things that you need to do if that makes sense so i've narrowed it down there's there's definitely things i'm not doing.
And there's things that I know have to get done you know paying people for some reason they think that's important. But yeah but i'm planning that into my day so because i'm going to a convention that i'm also kind of working. It's it's a delicate balance of like fitting things in where I can.
And it just kind of takes extra planning but i'm also planning on. Taking breaks and taking time with myself but also since many soup is going with me spending time with them too like this is a vacation of sorts and.
It's all about balance really it's all about balance yeah i was going to ask about that of you know there is the whole like oh let everybody know what you can do and what you won't be able to do and what you know what's happening what's not happening.
But also how how are you when it comes to planning to vacation like how do you are you are you the type that. Is like I want to get there and I want to have all of my stuff planned out even the fun bits or you like get there and you know we'll do we do we do we do. I it's mainly like.
I plan the things that have to get done because if it's not in my calendar it's not going to happen especially when you throw in time zone changes like that's. We're crossing the entire United States it's going to be a totally different time zone totally different world all of that.
And it's it's important for me to plan and schedule the things that have to get done even things that could be done at any time I make sure to put it in my calendar so that I can see it and and make sure that it happens.
Other than that i'm very i'm pretty good especially when there's people that I know very well and love i'm pretty good at detaching. So some of these people i've known for more than 20 years. This is the convention in Atlanta that I went to last year.
So these are friendships that i've had for a while and i'm really excited to be able to. Hang out with them and visit with them and see them and hug them and just experience.
These people again so that makes it easier for me to kind of decompress and discharge any sort of oh I should be working types of vibes. Other than that I try not to be too. Overplanning. Because other people in my group that i'm traveling with don't necessarily like that as much.
And it also doesn't leave as much room for the. Spontaneity that happens or you know variations that can occur and so you know we're going to get there.
In the afternoon and we're planning on you know going to the hotel and checking in and then we're going to go to the grocery store and get the groceries that we're going to need for the week. And then after that we have dinner plans but that's it so we'll probably take a nap.
Because it will be a very early morning and and you know we have some lists of things that we want to do and ideas but they aren't necessarily blocked in and they're also if I don't do them it's not the end of the world.
And I think that's really helpful to have like almost three lists you have the must do things you have the. Would like to do and then you have the if we have time things on the list and so writing things down putting it in you know a notes document whatever.
Like having that out of your brain and onto a like a place to to research to look up again can be really helpful because then you're not thinking about it too hard so I highly recommend doing that. Yeah it is interesting how.
 Well it's funny because like I feel like what we're doing is very similar i'm also going to be working at a conference and the unlike last year where I was there kind of working but mostly just enjoying my time this year I am like working working I am doing way more work than I probably have ever done at an event and I'm going to be working.
 I'm in many ways planning that i'm going to be too tired to do as much as I normally would and that that has me a little worried again this is one of those moments where a lot of us gather from people from all over the world i'm going to see from my friends from like Japan and Taiwan and i'm going to see friends from just others.
 I'm going to see friends from all over the world and I'm going to be working on the sites of the US and parts of South America I just confirmed like a good friend of mine from Brazil is coming up so like there there's like so many things that are like if I don't hang out with these people now I probably won't be able to do it again until next year.
I'm just hopeful because I know that just some of those people i'm just not going to be able to hang out with and I hope that you know we have a good a good friendship and a quaint in ship that like that's understanding but I also like it makes me sad.
But yeah enough about enough about that let's let's talk a little bit about the.
 preparation you you talked about it a little bit of like you know communicating with all the people all of your you know quote unquote like stakeholders that like hey i'm traveling don't expect you know this kind of work from me I will be doing a little bit of work but it'll be like this type how do you personally.
prepare yourself for travel like what's what's the secret soup. i'm packing sauce like yeah so I have a an app that I use for my packing list and I use it not necessarily while i'm packing but as like to.
To put it on like a separate list if that makes sense so i'm very much an analog list writer I love writing things down it helps me read things it helps me like process but of course. You don't want to miss anything like plain and simple that's not how it works and so I like to still have. The app.
list available to make sure that i'm not missing things like meds or. You know whatever I can't even think of other things that would be important to me yes rails and trying to remember don't say don't say keep the suspension. Well i have to find it because i don't remember what it's.
I haven't looked at it so much suspense from the john what is this what is this what is this app you speak. The app the app is called be and yeah we really love the app be and and yeah if you want to know what the actual name is yeah they can they can sponsor us. I I too keep a list in an app.
That i i kind of do like count down lists it's kind of weird and i'll have like. T minus whenever to the event and i'll have kind of a running like do like a running checklist like a week out that's like okay i need to do this and you do this and you do this.
And then I just have basically a gigantic list and then I slowly work my way down that list afterwards and. While it isn't good at remembering things apparently like the milk or and things like that it does at least make it so that on the day of and the day before i'm not.
Super like anxious about oh i need to go do this i need to go do that it's like no i know what i need to do and.
i've planned it out like t minus five you need to make sure that any purchases that you're going to have to do get you know that they're put in so that they have time to ship and get here on time.
 T minus four you need to figure out what clothes you're taking you don't have to pack them, but you need to figure it out like what you're going to take clothing wise t minus three you know make sure that your projects are wrapped up in that you've presented them to the stakeholders t minus two like.
Some other stuff i don't even remember what i did on t minus two i think i made an emergency trip to best by. And then t minus one.
Don't do anything like try to mentally prepare yourself like and by the way as we're recording this it is t minus one and my plans work wise are two meetings that i have to attend.
And like packing and that's it so that tomorrow morning everything is already packed everything is ready to go i don't have to do anything but grab my stuff which will be at the door. ready for me and then to the airport.
So I have some bad news for people that wanted to know the app it's called simple checklist and apparently it doesn't exist anymore so i was trying to get the link to come out.
And it doesn't work so it was great because there's like with a single button you can refresh and like remove everything from the list. And so it just is reused without having to like duplicate it or whatever i'll try and see if I can find a replacement but I my quick Google search does not.
same helpful because they're trying to like oh use notion and i'm like this is not what I want so i'm sorry y'all i wish I could help. With the app but maybe i'll find another one I think there's also this this like beauty of. Since we're going to be out of the boundaries of our.
normal space we then reach for tools that are not part of our normal space as well in your case that are not part of anybody space anymore because they're gone. But I I do tend to.
To use like digital productivity tools when i'm traveling mostly because I leave my notebook here and I take my I take my my travel notebook which is more like the hipster pda for those that no no. But it it absolutely keeps me like. If if I try to think how I normally would I would not be able to.
work effectively because i'm not in that mindset i'm not in that space i'm usually running around frantically like i'm at this person I need to do that so it's just easier for me to be like.
J in travel mode operates this way and I guess the one caveat to that is like if i'm traveling for an extremely long time and I actually have the ability to like set up a little office space for myself.
Like I did last year when I was gone for like a month then that's that's definitely like a different situation but my my normal travel of. You know gone three to five days or something like that is alright time to stop thinking like this and start thinking like this and.
It is kind of a little you know in case of travel pool the the travel productivity you know but or push the travel productivity button i don't even use the same pens like things are completely different for me. yeah it's it's it's always the important I think to make sure that you.
Put some attention into that so whether it's I don't know bringing a candle that you can light in the hotel that like it's like okay this is my working time or like a specific playlist pulling something that you have at home.
To tie it into oh this is work time can be helpful um or you know taking the the pen um that you do use at home to. Wow you're on your trip with you uh something to connect your brain with working from home like working from your home base you know what i'm trying to say.
I know it's trying to say it can't be helpful or. Finding something that. Is not something normal that you could do to make it extra special that still will help you. Work productively because you want to get stuff done as fast as you can so that you can go back to play.
And for those interested uh the pen that I use in travel is my studio neat mark one. Nice which is a good little pen but it's a very special relay one the very special relay one yes um but I don't I don't use my fountain pens mostly because i'm terrified of of ink getting everywhere inside of.
Gosh me too. Lights um yeah however however uh this convention we're having a. Uh a pens swap there's a bunch of us that are like big um uh pen nerds and so it's basically we're going to have a mini pens show so i'm bringing a bunch of my old uh uh ink samples that I have.
And uh yeah i'm very excited i'm very excited to see what happens I was considering doing a.
pin a pin meet and greet like halids all the the fancy pen nerds that are going to be at the conference bring your pens however again i don't know that's one of those things you kind of got a plan in advance and.
i'm doing enough stuff already i don't think planning another thing would be the right idea. yeah yeah that's a that's a smart the only reason i'm doing this is because somebody else um was planning it and i just jumped in. So it works out i'm letting other people do things proud.
Now i know that this could probably be the next episode um but i i i feel like it's too easy if it is but what is your strategy or what is your potential strategy for. After the. event happens and you get back home like what's your process for getting reoriented into. um i guess normalcy.
That's a great question. uh i don't have an answer okay. And would love any suggestions. So I think for me like one vacation again I know for you I think you're you're trying to do a little travel plus vacation i am.
Purely traveling and working also see back a few episodes this this is the super bowl event that I was talking about this is literally the wrap up to all of the work that i've been.
putting in for the last you know couple of months and i am tired i even i even put that we had this big meeting at work and i was like. We have so much in store i'm so tired i mean excited. And so i think the first thing is like this isn't a vacation for me this is work and because of that i'm.
Now going to then take the vacation time that i probably should have been taking up does don't remember like i've been sick. I don't think it was during the week that we recorded but there was like an off week where like the stomach virus ran through the family.
And like i could not take the time off because it was like i got to get this stuff done we got to be ready like this is that moment and like. Now i'm like okay i need to catch up on all of this time off and relax and rest and then.
Again go into the preseason of the next big event which happens at in a couple of months which for me is preparing to go to the next event and luckily these events are more just.
For me is preparing to go to the next event and luckily these events are more just for me so i will have a little bit of time to have a you know have some fun and and hang out but.
Yeah i think step one get back unpack take a few days to just relax and then after that it's going to be sit down with myself and be like okay. T minus whatever until the next event in June what do we need to be focused on what do we need to be thinking about and then start that process over.
Yeah yeah i think i'm looking at my calendar. I think I have. Month before I have to travel again and it's not on a plane so that's helpful i don't have to fly again. Till June I think which is again for work travel plus fun because that's how I roll but i'm.
I think because so last time I traveled like this. I didn't have as much going on as I have now and I know that.
This is going to be a very important like event for my brain to see how my brain is going to do so we'll see how it goes we'll see what improvements I can make because I have I think two other.
Light trips this year i'm going on possibly another if I get invited to the right carpet again like all of these things are are coming into play.
And I need to do a better job of it so this is kind of like holding myself accountable because that's what we do here in conduit is we give suggestions and support each other in hard things so thank you for doing that.
Here conduit we care about accountability we con care no that's not we we also care about our connections for the next episode and Kathy what is your connection for the next step.
My connection is going to be to use this trip and return as a way to solidify a plan for planning while traveling that makes sense. Okay okay so. My connection i'm going to not do the my connections have a good trip i am going to come back and take a couple of days off and then give myself about.
For five days before the next episode to create that timeline that t minus whatever. For the next event and and my hope is that that will allow me to.
Have time to relax but also understand that there's you know hey we got back we relax now there's work to be done and get back into it relatively quickly yeah. Yeah that's great what about the conductors alright shark of the show Chris.
His connection for the next conduit is to finish reorganizing is home office and time for the in laws to visit from out of state. Office becomes the guest room when people come to visit oh my goodness that's like stressful.
But i'm super excited for you to you know do your home office and and get things done so well done. Good luck i mean. Ha our fish bear the show fish guy says new connection I need to be better about household tasks currently I do things as I think of them or bump into them. Old school room bestile.
i'm going to make lists and explore some sort of priority scheme hmm that's interesting I want to learn more about that as I too have a very room but ask like hey. I stub my toe on this thing I guess it's time to go clean.
Yeah so our Oracle of the show they say sadly I am no longer staying near a beach but i'll try again to meditate three times a week in my boring house.
Sounds to me like you need to like put a picture on your computer of a beach and play some relaxing beach music sounds and then voila you're totally at the beach except not really. Like a black our mountain dweller of the show. Hey what's his name again oh yeah low game.
Finish the flooring well at least that's what he wants to do that's the next connection is to finish the flooring bonus points for building the kitchen.
Just yeah that's all yeah that's it you know just building the kitchen and moving but both of those rely on factors outside of their control so okay I mean. Take it easy Superman.
Our blue dragon of the show Skylar says new connection get through final exams and be done for the summer yes you're so close.
Can't wait to hear how it goes our identical to another show Aaron says new connection I need to make a follow up appointment for some blood work to check progress on me hopefully improving.
On a health issue from last year yes please be getting better and do the things get the appointments all the stuff to to make that a reality.
