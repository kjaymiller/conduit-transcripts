From RelayFM, you're listening to Conduit, the show where we condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that definitely has one half of this pair that does not have gross opinions about how other people enjoy things. And the other person is me.
Hi, I'm Kathy Campbell. And with me today is Jay Miller. Gross is a synonym that I would not have picked for myself, but also. But also, am I wrong? I agree to disagree. Okay. Well, if you want to know what we were talking about and why this came up, you should be a superconductor.
Lots of fun things happen in the pre and post show. Fun things is somewhat loosely based. But the pre show today, we did help out Jay to possibly figure out what he's doing in November. I don't know. We'll find out.
This week in the Discord, lots of discussion about the podcast-a-thon, which was incredible. We had an amazing day and lots of do-over, like, re-dos, conversations, all sorts of good things about it in the... Yeah, in the Discord.
And if you want to join us over there, if you are a member of any show, you can be there in the Discord. And also listen live, where right now we are talking with our listeners who are listening live with us right now, which is super fun.
So, Jay, what happened last week in the co-working? Well, in the co-working, we didn't have co-working. I know. I was waiting for you. I was like, wait, like, did something happen in co-working? In the co-working, I was in an airport and then I was getting on a plane and then the plane took off.
That's what happened in the co-working. I was also on the plane. Yep. And that's fine. And also, just for the record, next week, too, we will not have a co-working that day either. And that's because I will be on a boat. And I will be in Manhattan giving a talk.
So if you're in Manhattan and you want to hang out that evening, then maybe let me know. I don't know. We'll figure it out. Reach me in the Discord. I like hanging out with people.
Our entire pre-show was basically being me interacting with other people in a positive and some might argue negative way. It was definitely a way. If any of these things sound like fun, like joining us for the co-working or listening live as we record in the Discord, visit Iamasuperconductor.
com to become a member today. That's letter I, letter M, letter A, superconductor.com. It's time for one good thing. Jay, what's one good thing that happened this last conduit? Well, the one good thing actually happened yesterday for me. I got a day off to spend with my kid.
My kid's out of school this week. And I was out of work yesterday because of all the travel that I had to do for work. So we didn't really do much. And that's OK. Like, I think there is there is this urge and like my kid feels it already.
That when you don't have the things that you normally have to do, you feel like you have to like flood it with something else. Oh, I'm off today. So now I got to go do that thing that I said I was going to do a month ago. So it's like or you could just enjoy the day off.
Like that is an option to like maybe I mean, some sometimes you got to do the thing, but like also just not. And taking time off to get some extra sleep, maybe watch a movie with your kid. Sit there and run around like a monster around the house. All these things are good, good options.
No, that's great. My good thing is I was going to say podcast-a-thon and that was. But I feel like that's an easy getaway, like a, you know. A gimme. So I am going to say that my one good thing was actually. Making it home safely because there was a lot of flight drama, airport drama.
I was potentially going to be spending way more time in Dallas than expected. But everyone was so kind on the airplane and in the airport and supportive and happy. And we made it home safe. So safe travels is my good thing.
I am always afraid of like I've had roughness in terms of layovers or like weather and stuff. See the episode right after my trip to D.C. But like anytime, anytime I'm expecting it and we, it's avoided. Ooh, it's one of the best feelings in the world. Yeah. Yeah. The flight there was fantastic.
It was perfect. No notes. And the flight home, I ended up getting home much later than expected. But, and so did Jason and Mike, who left like after me by a significant time. Yeah. It just, it was, it was interesting, but we all made it at home safe. And that's, that's for the best, for the best.
What about connections? Uh, well, thanks to our amazing guest hosts, John, who will say John P, even though his last name doesn't start with the P his app does. Um, so thank you, John, again, for being an amazing guest. And, uh, based on that, I think there was this theme around staying hydrated.
Uh, there was a nice little water dispenser right around the corner from the booth that I was at to which I had my little cup and I filled that thing up at least 15 times. So I, I can say that I, I definitely, definitely worked to make sure that I was, I was all good. Amazing.
Um, I also had a goal of staying hydrated for podcastathon 12 hours is a very long time. And we were there multiple hours before and multiple hours after helping clean up. Um, and I refilled my Stanley Tumbler, I think three or four times and drank it all on top of coffee and, um, energy drinks.
So I'm really impressed, uh, with how well I stayed hydrated, how many times I, uh, had to go use the bathroom because I was so hydrated and, and having it, um, concentrating on that, uh, is fantastic. So yay for having that concentration in place.
Um, what about our conductors? Oh, well, you know, they, they did stuff and things like our identical twin of the show, Aaron. Uh, he said green circle. I booked my hotels for Quebec and I got the software dependency updates done as well.
Crushing it, this conduit and ready for the pod cast a switch on our shark of the show. Chris, uh, says my last connection was to prepare my office for the next phase of reorganization. Yellow circle work was done, but I'm not ready just yet. That's okay. You're moving on. You're moving forward.
And that's important. Robotics engineer of the show. Aiden said green circle, the bones of a plan are ready. And assuming things go smoothly, I know what my next conduit connection is going to be. Yay. So excited. Our Carl of all trades at the show.
Carl says connection check yellow heart with a laptop. I'm now in all systems and have full access to technology, but the backlog of tasks on top of my teaching duty is large, taking advantage of a two day back to back professional development to get on top of things. Very smart. Well done.
Our Esperanto knitter of the show. Iri Zanyo says green checkmark. I did things with doom piles and made the bedroom as nice as I could with the time I had and successfully organized two video game events back to back. That's dope. That's, that's fun.
I'm glad you got some fun stuff and some chore stuff and maybe the chore stuff was fun too. Amazing. Our fish bear of the show. Fishy Kai says connection check green circle. I got the inspection scheduled. They'll be here this week. Yay. Incredible. Our soprano of the show.
Devo said a green heart scheduled my car maintenance appointment. Good job. Good job. Good job. Our doll of the show. Dolly Molly says connection check green heart. I've managed to keep up with my job by going to the library a couple times a week. Well done.
It's amazing how different having a different location can feel. Yep. Our checklist enthusiasts of the show. Mike said a green checkmark. Catch up on the housework. I'm up to date on the housework for now. Probably won't stay that way for long.
You know, it's a it's an ongoing thing that we got to sit there and fight. Yes, absolutely. The nameless of the show nameless says connection check green circle. I prepared everything for the new jobby job. I have the list of things that I have to return to them on Friday.
Also, I bought the duplicate duplicated for my personal use fan. Freaking tastic. That's so exciting. I can't wait to hear how it goes. And now the relay community is uniting to support St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. This childhood cancer awareness month for the seventh year in a row. St.
Jude's mission is to make sure no child loses their life to cancer, no matter where they live and they need our help. You might've caught the 2025 podcast a thon, which was a ton of fun. So many of you showed so much generosity, but there's still time to make an impact. At St.
Jude, the end of treatment is not the end of support. The transition oncology program, also known as TOP, helps prepare families for a smoother transition from treatment to everyday life.
TOP develops a treatment summary to help families and their local healthcare providers move forward to help families plan for their children's specific needs.
They screen for possible mental and emotional health concerns, find out if the child needs school or job training support, find out if they need help finding health insurance, help families access healthcare services, and provide education about the child's current and future health needs.
It's just part of the comprehensive care provided by St. Jude. And I will say there is so much to be said about how St.
Jude supports these families, not just on an individual basis, making sure that no child dies at the dawn of life as best they can, but also making sure that they have their futures in play, that they're able to kind of sit and have that future, those tomorrows that are there.
We were lucky enough to tour Domino's Village, which is something that opened up two years ago. And it is where... So something that you may not know is that there are not a lot of hospital beds in the St.
Jude Children's Research Hospital because most of the treatments and things are done kind of similar to like an outpatient style and that you come in to get your stuff and then you go to wherever you and your family is staying.
And Domino's Village is this incredible opportunity to have kind of a space that you can claim a little bit as your own. So they have one, two, and three bedroom apartments that are all connected to these incredible community spaces.
There's a gigantic kitchen to have like cooking classes or events to do things there. Um, there's a toddler room that looks like a beach, like the floor looks like sand and there's a lighthouse and a bunch of toys. There's a fitness room. There's a gaming room.
There's all of these opportunities to allow, uh, these children who are going through similar things, find each other, um, and have a community because when you're at home or with your, wherever your, your normal, quote unquote, normal community is, no one else is going through that necessarily.
And so by being able to meet other kids and other parents that are experiencing the same thing that you are, you have a connection and you're able to, um, to, to relax a little bit more.
So you don't have to worry about somebody saying the wrong thing because they know what you're going through and that support is just a concentration that they have. And they talk to so many patient families to get this information.
So instead of just assuming that, oh, we know best, they are allowing everyone to support, um, that information and, and feeding the information into it. Uh, and it's just really impressive and incredible.
And we're inviting the relay community to continue the incredible generosity shown over the past seven years. And once again, make a donation to support the life-saving mission of St. Jude.
Donors making an individual gift of just $60 or more will be eligible to redeem a digital bundle of campaign themed wallpapers and screensaver. The screensaver is incredible. James Thompson does it every year. And there are so many Easter eggs this year.
Well, in every year, um, and it's, you don't want to miss it. And donors making a gift of a hundred dollars or more can redeem the 2025 sticker pack featuring six all new host stickers, which are incredible. I'm so excited to see these in person, uh, and have a, uh, sticker version of myself.
I'm very excited. Please go to St. Jude.org slash relay where you can make a donation today. Help give them more tomorrows. Go to St. Jude.org slash relay to donate or start your own fundraiser today. It is not too late to start your own fundraiser. Uh, go in and do that now. St. Jude.
org slash relay. Woo. All right. Uh, so our, our topic today is called human check-in. And, uh, Jay, this was your idea. And so I'm going to let you kind of, um, describe it, shall we say? Yeah. So both of us are in the throes of a busy time. Um, that's probably like the best way to put it.
Um, I'm actually on a special team at work and that got moved that, that all happened suddenly, uh, similar to what, what I did, uh, a couple, uh, well, I almost had a couple of years ago was last year.
Uh, this time last year, actually I got put on a, I got put on a special team and now I'm on a new special team. Um, hooray. Uh, that lasted until the new year. This one is lasting until I think February. Oh, it is, it is wildly, wildly, wildly. Um, I don't want to say stressful.
I don't think stressful is the right adjective to describe what I'm going through. Um, there is the fighting of burnout. There is also the envisioning of what I wish I was doing more of and how I'm not doing those things.
And one of the things, Kathy, I didn't mention in the conversation that we were having earlier about, uh, my travel between, uh, for some of these events is that some of them are not on behalf of my employer. Um, I was reached out to directly about going and speaking, um, at a couple of things.
And I take pride in being able to go and do that and having somewhat of a small, you know, small but mighty platform, I guess, to be able to go and talk to people about stuff. Um, I mean, it's also terrifying. Like, why? Tell me more. I'm not, I'm nowhere near this popular or this famous.
That's clearly not true. I mean, I, I hope, I hope this is the case. I do very public work for people who don't have a lot of people cheering for them right now. And I feel that that work is important, but I also see that people are one being attacked. Um, some are, are dying.
Um, I don't think I'm doing anything that controversial, but I also feel a pressure in that, like, I literally just want to do my job, raise my kid and live my life. And I believe that everyone should have the right to do that. And a lot of, it'll take super controversial.
Um, especially if you work at Nestle, that's a deep cut, which I can tell you about later. Um, but there, there are, there is the added stress of like, right now, my family is like, Hey, I have four travel things planned for the rest of the year. And my family is like four. That's a lot.
You said you were going to do less traveling. And I was told that I was going to do less traveling. And here I am doing four travel events for the rest of the year. I, I keep being told that one plus one is two. However, it seems to wind up always being four or five or six.
And I'm at a point now where the things that I want to do are more important to me than the things that allow me to do the things that I want to do. And I think that that's healthy, but I also think that most employers hate that.
They, they hate that they, your job should be the most important thing in your life because without it, you know, what does that make you? And what it makes you is a perfectly normal human being. But I, I got to spend time again. I genuinely had a great time in LA. All of my, all of my bits aside.
Yes, I was a grumpy Gus at the ball game, but like, other than that, I had a good time. I got to talk to people on my team who I would never get to read, you know, work with.
Normally I got to, I'm seen almost as someone who is like, has veteran status there just because I've been there for almost two years now. And like, there's been a lot of turnovers. So like, there's a lot of stuff happening.
Um, I got to have excellent conversations with people from all over the world doing different things. I'm seen as someone who has importance to the company for some reason, even though I don't fully see it. And I think that that's a part of it is that I don't fully see it.
I know what I bring to conduit. I know what I bring to like Black Python devs. Sometimes when I look at my job, I don't know what I'm bringing. And I think that that maybe aggravates, uh, something, uh, Kathy, did I tell you that I almost cut my finger off? What? Yes. I think we talked about this.
Did we not? I don't think we did. Um, maybe I've slept since then at the very least. So tell me again. Um, so in trying, in trying to clear off my, my backyard, which we have a really large grape vine, I tripped and dropped the hedge trimmers that were running.
And as to stop it from going and hitting me in the face, which would have been bad. Um, I put my hands up in defense and hit the side of my finger. Um, wasn't, wasn't great, Bob. Wasn't great. Um, yeah, you definitely did not tell me that. Yeah. Um, luckily I'm good.
My, does it not have an automatic stop? It does, but it, it, it winds down as it's stopping. That, that seems unfortunate. Listen, I am not an expert when it comes to that type of stuff. Are you squeamish? No. Okay. You're getting two photos then. Okay. Yeah. That seems unhelpful.
Cause I would feel like if it's, if it's moving quickly. Oh, beautiful. Yeah. Yeah. You almost lost your whole finger. Well, at least like the, the nub of the end of it. Yeah. Like, and it kept going with a chip bone.
Like, yeah, that looks like the same amount that my brother lost when he was little playing, um, uh, spaceship in like a step ladder and his friend. Oh, my whole body just, just, I, uh, uh, um, so fun. All that to say, I'm fine. Kathy, how are you? Yeah. Yeah. Great. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool.
Cool. Cool. We can dive into any of that if, if we feel we need to, but also I'm okay with just, I haven't, I haven't had time to talk about any of that stuff, um, or a place to talk about any of that stuff.
And I know that like, this probably isn't the most ideal place, but it's a place that I got. So, and honestly, it's our show, so we can do what we want, but we're doing it for, we're here for our, our listeners. We love our listeners.
Um, and also, so I get it, um, having a, a, a place is important. Um, speaking of injuries, uh, while I was gone in Memphis, I got a text from mini soup saying, Hey mom, I got in a fight. And I'm like, what? Uh, it wasn't actually in a fight, but it sure did look like it.
They were playing tag at dance and, uh, mini soup ran headfirst into one of their teammates, uh, their teammates heads, in fact. And, uh, so that was, I think on Wednesday, they still have swelling around like the bridge of their nose and a black eye and it's great. Um, they're breathing fine.
It's not broken. Um, it, it's just taking forever to, to heal. And thankfully we're not doing, uh, dance team photos today because that would have been very sad. Oh yeah. Yeah.
I can't imagine just the like, all right, well time to go and like have this thing that's supposed to represent you at a time. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it, and I mean, I would have, I would have obviously photoshopped as much as I could to make it look okay. But yeah, that was not, not ideal.
And I hate that I wasn't here for them. Like that's, that's the really hard part is not, not being here. Um, and it makes me, it makes me sad, but, um, yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm doing, how's that? I feel like I'm in a big flux. Gosh, I swear.
I say that all the fricking time that I'm in this like big business, like life flux, but I don't know, I don't know what's happening anymore. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know anything. Um, and, uh, part of me wants to use.
So I leave on Friday for a cruise, which I am very excited for because I haven't had a true vacation vacation in a while. Um, and there's no, I am not paying $18 a day for just messaging, uh, internet, let alone the like $75 a day for real internet. Um, that's not going to happen.
So I'm going to be completely cut off from the world. Um, which is slightly terrifying. I will, I will say, um, but I think it's going to be good.
And I'm, I'm, I'm hoping to be able to use it to kind of not figure out my life because that's optimistic, but see if I can, and can find what I'm, what I'm doing. Like, is this what I want to keep doing? Is this how I want to keep living my life? Um, or yeah, I don't, I don't know. I don't know.
And, uh, I don't like not knowing. I don't like not planning. Um, cause I love when I get to help people, but I'm not helping enough people to really make it work, if that makes sense. So, yeah.
Um, I think that is the, see, the biggest challenge is that I think we both find so much value in what we're doing. And, and Kathy, I think we've talked about this in the past, just one of the things that made me like immediately be happy about conduit.
Um, again, insert like the, no, this isn't the death of conduit. Like, no, no, like get all that out of your head. Um, not you, Kathy, the other people. Yeah. It's like, this is, this is our, this is our like my weekly therapy session. Like you have to be here and you have to listen. Sorry.
Um, but like conduit was the first show that I had, that I had more than like one or two people who actually had feedback and provided feedback and were like talking back to the things that I was doing. And it's weird because it's not numbers wise.
It's about on par with shows that I've done in the past, but it was more closely aligned with just reaching people in a way that they could, they would reach back.
And I think that there's something very nice about that because we see the value that it brings, but we have to remember that that, that, that is the payment in many ways. Um, to those people that, that do make it a financial thing too, that lighten the load, like, thank you so much.
Trust me, you are very much like appreciated for that. But conduit provides Christmas money or new iPhone money come iPhone season where I will not transfer everything over correctly and lose a bunch of data, which is fine.
But it's not pay a mortgage or insurance or it's not a, a, a clean bill of health, you know, from a doctor. It's not physical therapy. It's not therapy in any way. I know I just joked saying it was therapy, but it's very much not.
Um, don't listen to conduit and let that be your therapy replacement. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, please, please go to actual therapy. Yes. If you can. It's, it's not life planning. It's, it's not so many things and it can't be that for other people.
But what I have learned and I learned this just from asking veterans, Hey, how's your mental health? Is that it doesn't feel like you're doing it alone when someone asks, when someone says, Hey, how are you doing?
When someone, and means it, and means like, I genuinely want to know how you're doing.
Like, I want to know the bad. I don't want to just know I'm fine or I'm okay, or I'm good. Like someone who actively cares. I have struggled in my nonprofit because what I have learned is that I can do a better job when I distance myself from the individual.
And when I focus most of my efforts on fundraising, but instead what I do is I have to put other people in charge of that physical connection. And the worst part about that is, is I can see the toll that it takes on the people that I've put, where I've put that on them.
I mean, granted they volunteer for it. So it wasn't like a, Hey, well, it's not a totally told situation. It was more of a like, Hey, I think you would be good for this, but also I only want you to do it for a year because it can be very draining. And now we're coming towards the end of that year.
I can just see, you can see it in their faces of like, I can't wait to pass this on to the next person. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Surprise. It's draining. Yeah.
But I, I am doing my best to get to a position to where I can say, Hey, I've been doing my best and I've been doing what I think is the best thing to do for this situation that protects my mental health that also protects my career long-term. Right. Yeah.
And I, I was hoping that, you know, you've been kind of doing the same given some of the concerns that you've had recently. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's interesting. And I feel like it's, it's rough. Um, it's, yeah, life is hard and it's heavy right now. There's a lot going on.
Um, there's a lot happening. It's, it's okay to be tired. It's okay to be drained. It's okay to feel over it, I guess. Um, it's okay to feel lost.
Um, especially having, when you have people that love you and can support you and, and be a part of that, um, it, it can be, it can be really important, but, uh, it, it's also important to remember that the future is, is coming. The future is still here.
 Uh, we can, we can do the hard things, um, and we can, and, uh, and set those boundaries up, um, to do the tire method, to, to find out what you should not do, um, and, and, and find those times and moments to find break and have, have, have moments to rest, um, and, and that it's okay to completely change everything.
Which I don't know. Um, I know there's a lot going on in people's lives too, on top of, you know, everything that's going on in the general world. Um, and, uh, we see you, we love you. We appreciate you. And we're so thankful that you exist in this world.
And, and we wish that there were less bad things that make us want to have to check in, uh, with each other, but also with our friends. Um, that being said, if we, we consider y'all as friends in a parasocial kind of way, um, I want to.
And the, um, that being said, if we consider y'all as friends in a parasocial is, is, is, is mutually like it, it's, it's both, it goes. Yeah.
Like we can't, you, you clearly can't be there for us and all the things that we have going on that we maybe don't reveal to you, but also we can't be there for you in the same way. Um, so in that, in knowing that, um, always, always willing to try to find time to connect with someone.
If they feel like connecting with me will benefit them in some way, I can't promise it's a, you know, sometime that week, sometime that month. Um, again, I have, I, I did recordings in like February for stuff that still hasn't gone out yet.
And like, I'm like, thank goodness, because I have zero time to be promoting that thing right now. Like I just don't. And I haven't. So like good. Yeah. Yeah.
I think, uh, it's important to, to know too, that sometimes you can't, I, I know I have a problem with a being a burden on somebody and be trying not to, um, be trouble. And also it's hard to put, uh, words to things sometimes.
Um, and that sometimes it's also okay to just be like, thank you for, for just existing in the space and, uh, being interested, but I can't, I can't, I can't explain anything right now.
You know, having, having friends like that, that can take that knowledge and that information that you're sharing and, and really appreciate it and love it. Um, so yeah, yeah, that's, that's our, that's our human check-in. Yep.
Um, but we have a good episode for our next conduit that we're really excited about. Um, something that podcast-a-thon really kind of refreshed my brain, uh, about is, um, how lucky I am to be in the, in amongst the people that I work with.
Um, and the, the skills and talents that a lot of them have, um, for example, Jason Snell is really good at being serious and silly at the same time. Um, Steven is incredible at that individual connection with that serious, serious, steady, foundational stuff.
Um, Casey manages to be so heartfelt, even if, you know, we just made a ton of fun of, um, Brad is just so kind and giving and, and basically we wanted to kind of hear from you.
So next episode, we're going to be talking about, um, skills that you can work towards being a better version of, um, but also what you see in other people. And so we want to hear from you. What is something and, and feel free to call them out.
Um, if, if it's an actual person or just a general thing that you've see people that are able to do. Um, we want to hear from you. Um, and, and, and, and someone that, that has that skill that you, uh, wish that you could be a part of. So feel free to, um, include it in your connection, um, space.
Uh, we will also, um, include a, uh, a Dropbox file, uh, link, uh, a Dropbox file request link. If you want to do any sort of audio, um, input, we would love to hear that as well. No pressure either way.
Um, we're just kind of putting this out there publicly, uh, cause we want to hear from you, our listeners. Um, and, uh, we appreciate you. Yeah, I, it was, it was an interesting topic and one that, you know, I feel like I've got, I've got a certain set of skills.
Um, but like, I'm sure that there are folks around me that have many, many more interesting things and hearing about some of those things would be, be great. Uh, so Kathy, we should put a very clear ask on, on the, okay.
So message us about how you learn either new skills or strengthening existing ones. And more importantly, how do you recognize skills in others? Um, that. I don't, I don't think we want to know. I don't, I don't want to know how I want to know what I want to know.
What is a skill that you are actively working on to be better at? And what's a skill that you see other people have? Like, I want to, I want to hear about the skills, not the, the how. And, and those skills can be two different things. Yes.
Like Kathy is really good at like all of the things administrative for the show. Like I know that in Kathy and I sometimes wonder how she keeps it all together. I personally have zero interest in learning any of those skills. I know. Because if I do, it will be the death of the show immediately.
And, and conversely, Jay, you have an incredible ability to put into words kind of what the show, what we talked about. Um, and, and kind of streamline the messaging. And I really, really appreciate that. Yeah. So yeah, stuff like that there.
Uh, let us know again, click the link in the show notes to, uh, give your voice memo. Um, or you can just add it to your connection. Um, the connection things are bait, like, just take all the stuff in that way. It's fine.
Um, but we would love, we'd love to talk about our own things for a brief second, but we'd love to really emphasize how some of our amazing conductors, uh, one are that amazing, uh, and how they do those things. They do. Yep.
And, and what, I think this is also an opportunity to kind of remember that you are good at things. Um, a lot of times we get in our own heads.
Um, I'm sure if you're listening to this episode or to this show, you are the type of person that could use a little bit of extra help and support, um, in, in what you're doing.
So please, um, you know, feel free to toot your own horn a little bit, uh, and let us know what you feel you're really good at. Um, and especially if it's something that you work hard to be better at. Um, I want to hear that especially. Um, so what else, uh, speaking of, nope, I don't know.
That's a segue. I'm so tired. I want to know what you're doing in the next fortnight. There we go. No, cause I'm hosting. So I want to know what you're doing in the next fortnight. Jay. Darn it. Uh, I am. Oh, well, I will be in New York. I will be at an event.
Um, I have been tasked by the team that I'm on to get some very specific feedback from that event. And I have to find a way to do that. Otherwise doing these kinds of events might be in jeopardy.
So I, I've got to solicit the feedback that my team would like, uh, while at this event, while also not being super corpo, no fun having Jay. Like I gotta, I gotta, I gotta keep, keep my, my style, be myself, but also I need to get this information from the community.
So, yeah, that's, that is it for me. What about you? Um, so part of, part of this week, again, we'll be, you know, fully not, um, not working, um, next week. And, uh, I am going to, I have a plan to finish a physical book.
I am bringing a physical book on this trip and it's really big and thick, um, with two C's. And I would like to finish reading that physical book. Hmm. Reading is fun. Demental. What about our connectors? Uh, well, I gotta, I gotta scroll. I gotta scroll. I keep losing the page.
Oh, I have three versions of the thing open now. That's not great. Um, our identical twin of the show. Aaron says looking to do as much as I can over the next few weeks to help my injured self get ready for the half marathon. I just want to throw out there.
Resting is a part of getting ready for the half marathon, especially while you're injured. It's true. Yep. Especially. Yeah. Bonus on the, in the injured part of things, but, uh, that's fine. You are, are, are making choices. We are not your parent. Um, moving on our shark of the show.
Chris says my next connection is to get my car back into the garage. It has been stuck outside for a couple of years. That sounds like a fantastic goal. I can't wait to hear how it goes. Our robotics engineer of the show, Aiden says back to practicing the flute.
I want to at least play through the scales three times a week and hopefully keep that going. Interesting. Interesting. Oh, that's a good one. That's a good one. Our Carl of all trades of the show. Carl says next connection check twofold.
Professionally clear out all tasks, training and responsibilities that are past due, but I have not gotten to do due to my late hire. And personally, an artist friend is coming to town to drop off music gear. I bought from her to support her transition.
And more importantly, hit up all of the art galleries because this is the state I live in help navigate the public space. So we can have a great time with no negative interaction. That is so kind of you. I am sure that she greatly appreciates the care and attention that you're putting into it.
And I can't wait to hear how it goes. Very much. The Esperanto knitter of the show, Iri Zanya says, preparing to travel home soon and will test the new templates I created for packing and for default tasks to do on returning home after being away for a while and rest.
Lots and lots and lots of rest. Yes. Our fish bear of the show, Fishy Kai says, new connection, schedule people for the next home improvement project, concrete lifting for my driveway.
You know, I'm sure this has something real to do, but I'm just imagining your concrete is like lifting weights to go stronger. And that is what I'm going to continue to think of. Uh, yeah, I don't, I don't know. I don't know what this is. Um, but it sounds very stressful.
Um, our soprano of the show, Debo says, write my class report update for my upcoming 25 year college reunion. Ooh, exciting. Yeah. 2,000 babies. Um, doll of the show, Dolly Molly says, new connection, keep going to the library. I think three times a week is a realistic goal. I love that.
I love that. Our checklist enthusiasts of the show, Mike says, uh, clean up the task backlog, catch up on tasks. I've saved in my task manager. Hey, I know a checklist enthusiast to talk to our nameless of the show. Nameless says new connection gets situated at the new role.
Something that I love about this show is the journey that we see throughout time. And I'm so excited to hear how this new job goes nameless.
