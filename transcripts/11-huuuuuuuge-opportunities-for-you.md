From ReliefM, you're listening to Conduit, the show where we condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. From ReliefM, this conduit, where we are all muddling around somehow to get through the day. This week's episode is sponsored by Pingdom. I'm your host Kathy.
And I'm Jay because this has been too long since we've recorded. And I feel like we're doing a great job, but we just need to be reminded. So I'm here reminding us Kathy, we're doing a great job. Let's keep going. Thank goodness, because wow. Yeah, it's been, it's been.
You know, we did an episode where we talked about like coming back from vacation, but that was just like a couple states trip that you did. And I went to the beach. I changed multiple time zones. At one point you were in the future. I was in the future and it was very strange.
And it's been more than a week since I've been home and I'm still not. So not quite adjusted, but I think part of that might also have to do with the fact that there was a little holiday called Thanksgiving. And that also like really threw off my week.
So basically I am a mess and a disaster, but I'm here. And I'm so happy to talk to my friend Jay. I mean, even if we've recorded a show before like all of our shows are relevant.
They're not like time bound, which is great because sometimes we need those reminders ourselves of like, how do I get back into the swing of things. And if you're wondering how to do that, check out episode six. I'll come to it.
But let's let's jump into some shout outs because I am excited for mine, but you have to go first. So well, good, because I am also excited for mine. I want to give a major huge shout out to Jason Denzel, who chose me to be his partner in crime for our trip to London.
And his the whole reason that I was able to go to London to attend the blue carpet premiere of the Wheel of Time, the new Amazon Amazon. Is that like part of the one? The new television show on Amazon Prime video.
If you want some more information about our trip or any any of that, you can go to drag amount dot com. That's drag in and mount as in the animal and amount. And without the aion.com or just click a link in the show notes.
But we had an incredible time and I was so honored to be a part of everything that happened. And I, but I'm also happy to be back. I'm happy that you're back. And I'm also like still excited because I've I've never known.
Well, at least I don't think I've known anyone that's done like any color of carpet. So it's it's cool to be, you know, I'm sure at some point now I'm even closer to Kevin Bacon than I was before. And to me, that's just insane. And I'm super stoked for you.
I'm super happy about, you know, some of the new stuff that you're doing. And we're going to talk about that later.
But I'm also happy that I've completed the trifecta of ATM people that I've talked to and ATMs for above the mess are sibling friendly show that talks about productivity and creativity and all the amazing things that make lives and being productive messy.
I've spoken to Rose before see my other podcasts and things for that in the past. I've spoken with wonderful friend of the show Maddie before, but I had never spoken with Izzy, comrade Izzy, who was actually what I wanted to was taking a break from social media and I wanted to respect that.
But they have since come back from their break. And now I was able to ping them and we talked for like a good hour and just kind of got to know each other got to know like we're both in tech and kind of have been around the tech space for a little bit.
So it was really cool to have a great conversation with a new friend and shout out to you, Izzy. And then I know I didn't put this in the doc because I'm a rebel, you know, you leave me to go away.
And I come back a totally different person, but huge shout out to Scotty of the show for subbing in for me and making the most incredible episode of conduit. How big was that huge you know it's huge when zoom cuts you out. Yeah, yeah, that tracks.
Thank you Scotty for being so incredibly vulnerable and open and sharing everything that you're going through. And I am so honored that you chose our show to be able to talk about that. And yesterday, as we record this yesterday.
So today is November 30th, we recorded yesterday was my husband's 11th stroke of her three. So he had had his master's stroke 11 years ago, which means I completely understand from a caregiver side of things.
This this journey of trying to figure out what is normal and how to make adjustments as things are constantly changing and you don't know what the future brings and you don't know. It's just basically it's all really scary. And I just want you to know how proud I am of you and your family.
And I'm here if you need anyone to talk to you. Yeah, that was kind of the challenge. And you know, when when the topic came up, there was a lot of like, but you know, we're like tangential to the pain. Like we've we've been in this experience. My mom and my grandmother both have lupus.
And like there's the situation of like, there are times where, you know, myself or like my younger sister, I've had to like carry her upstairs because of the pain. Like we were definitely like right there next to it.
We see some of it, but it's really hard to equate that to being the person and the feelings of being the person. And honestly, like I said, Scottie tried to call me right before we started recording and it like through a wrench and all this stuff. And like, like we talk that much.
Like we text each other every day. And like we have these conversations. And there were still things that I didn't know. And I didn't fully grasp exactly how much or how much of what's got to was going through. So I mean, again, Scotty, thank you so much for for being a wonderful substitute.
And coming on to the show and being so open and vulnerable about what's going on in your life. And also, we didn't say it enough. And actually, Scotty mentioned this on Twitter as well. Shout out to his family who has had to adjust with him. And I know that that's always a challenge.
And that side, I can definitely empathize with more and understand, you know, some of what they're going through. But I it doesn't make it any easier. So a big shout out to them. And I hope that recoveries and good feelings all around that said, Scotty, you know why I'm saying this.
Why don't you just go for a skate? That's that's why I love this shows because we can actually make very specific references to people like, hey, blue sky dragon of the show. Good luck on your finals. I know you can do it. But we're going to get into that later. Yes.
Don't we have another shout out. Shout out to the holiday season. Yo, what is this? Happy Solstices of things. Solstices of things. Holidays of the show. It is we have a gift for you. So, but of course, we're going to wrap it up and put it under the tree, stick it in a shoe outside your door.
I don't know what that holiday is. Yeah, all sorts of holiday events, something. You have a gift coming to you. But if you want to sneak peak, make sure to join the relay.fm discord.
Now, Jay, how would someone do that if they wanted to be a part of the discord and the amazing group of people that we call our conductors? Well, it's quite simple. First you go to relay.fm slash conduit. And then there's going to be some buttons up there for you to join and support the show.
And if you do that, then you get an invite to the discord. And then from there, you can choose your faction. Are you going to be a system or a theme or are you going to be a break room of chaos and, oh, sorry, too much, too much. I got to bring it back. Back. Come on. We're not scary people away.
We want people to come and play with us. Yes. And also this just in from the relay.fm. You can actually now give the gift of membership to people. So if you have thought, you know what? My partner or my friend really loves those relay.fm shows. And they're listening to this in the car right now.
And I'm hearing about this for the first time. Maybe you can go to relay.fm and gift a membership for the holiday season. And you can do it for a month. You can do it for a year. You can do it for however you wish.
But give the gift so that they can receive the gift that we have for all of our conductors and all of our amazing people in the relay.fm community. Yeah. So stay tuned. Check out the discord for a special announcement.
And then we will announce it to the public on our episode that comes out after this one. I think it's time to check those connections. Connection check. Zap. So my connection was working on my intentionality and making active choices. And what I was making those choices.
And I was being actively involved in what I was doing. I'm marking this as kind of like yellow flag orange flag. What do we talk about middle stoplight? Basically, I feel like I worked on it. It was not perfect, which if you have listened to the show before, you know, um, dot, like that's normal.
And so I'm, you know what? I'm changing this. I'm making it green because I did it. Some points. I'm never going to be perfect. And I need to be able to make it green. Like really own the fact that I did work on it. It's just like meditation.
You know, when you meditate and a good person who is leading that meditation, who might say, you know, these thoughts are going to come in and make adjustments and affect your mind set or what you're thinking or what you're doing. And it's okay. That's totally normal.
Let it come in, acknowledge it and let it pass. And so I obviously was not perfect and would never be for perfect and cannot expect myself to be perfect. And as such, I'm saying that my connection check was successful because I did it.
First of all, I love that you changed literally the color of the status for those that don't know. Here's the inside scoop on what we do. We have a document and we color code are connections based on how we did. And I literally watched to go from orange to green.
I was like, wow, that is that is a very medical, porcelain feeling happening right there as as through the process of talking through it. You like like, you know what? I did con do it. And I love that. I'm also going to throw out there.
I made a snippet this week for, you know, YCDI for you con did it. And that is awesome. And that's the nerdiest thing that I got to do. And I'm totally stoked about it. But also Kathy, I remember someone in our discord. I believe it was that looked up the definition of what perfect is.
And it's quite literally as good as it could possibly be. And that doesn't mean that just because you didn't do it didn't mean that you didn't do it perfectly. Like you doing it to the best of your ability meant that you did it perfectly. So all right, I'll accept that. Thank you.
That is so awesome. My connection was pretty simple. Coffee and artificial sun. First thing in the morning. I'm going to, I'm going to say I struggled with this as the days got longer. I did do a good job at the beginning like the first week.
I'll also say I had to do this longer than I usually would for a connection because we recorded a little early. So there was a good two weeks where I was like on point. And, you know, I think more than anything, this was like a learning lesson. So I'm okay leaving it as yellow.
 But I did notice that one artificial sunlight are also known as a vitamin D supplement and coffee before I start working has me more prepared and also gives me time to like wake up and think about like how I'm going to do my day before I just start jumping in and then letting things kind of just happen as they happen.
And I mean, I'm definitely going to try to keep doing it. I can't promise that I'll always get it right. But you know what? That's fine. I would rather at least know that this helps me some and kind of go from there. I think that means that you did it perfectly.
Okay, I'm going to do a blue check just because I can. Sorry, I don't sometimes I want to be a little silly and I love our silly banter shots fired. I missed it. I must say I definitely missed it.
You know what I didn't miss all of the different connections from our conductors this had an absolute awesome connection checks from our conductors. One from an unexpected zap of the show Scotty Jackson Jackson. Jackson.
Maybe tomorrow and there's a reference there between the Jackson and maybe tomorrow, which is now my daughter's favorite song.
Anyway, Scotty says I worked purposefully scheduling recreation and fun activities into my day that I would commit to not 100% successful, but more than 80% and I really enjoy the reward that deliberate time and planned breaks off for me in my day. I really like that. That's so good.
Plan your breaks, plan your time to do nothing. Let yourself acknowledge the fact that breaks are good and breaks are important and breaks are healthy. And if you schedule them in, then you know, you can't miss out on that date with yourself. Absolutely.
Like we've talked about my love of Tetris and like how I even have certain times of the day where it's like it's Tetris time and I'm going to go do that. And I know it's Tetris time is actually the name of a player who plays Tetris.
So if you're listening to this, I doubt you are, but if you are, hi. What about the next connection? Yeah, our next connection comes from Dave rails of the show who says that while he did it prepared to start writing device already, he didn't actually start that project is on hold for now.
And here's the thing is I am so proud of you for marking it as like partially done. So instead of a complete failure.
They put it as a an orange square, yellow square, what is color? And basically that is incredible because you didn't allow yourself to think of yourself as like failing this, this connection. You're like, hey, got it started.
And that is great because that will mean the barrier for entry to come back to it is smaller because you know what the setup looks like. And so I can't wait to hear about what you've written. I love the idea of putting something on hold and having it like again, mark down be intentional about it.
But at the same time, the one fear that I always have is the idea of some someday maybe like if you have it on hold, the only advice I can give Dave is to also specify when you want to come back to it.
Even if that means like I'm going to do this next month or in six months or next year for nanorimals something like that. Like if you give it a specific time, it doesn't have that feeling of like, I'll get to it when I have time like that. I hate someday maybe because of that.
It's like, someday maybe means probably maybe not. And then also I think it's important to find out maybe why you didn't start the writing was it overwhelmed with a blank page.
And if so, then just start, you know, brain dumping and and and just or pulling the closest book that you have and start just typing up the words from the book next to you. It was something to get in the process and then you can start putting your own words into into play.
Or is it you ran out of time because you were setting things up well then it's already set up so you can do it again. I tried to figure out kind of what was blocking you can can help the progress of that connection and that idea of and goal of what you're doing.
This will be the second time I've said this in two episodes. I really wish there was a way to get more information from some of the people that submit these. And I really hope we can figure out a good way to do that and I do too that would be really incredible.
If you have any ideas for us, let us know. Absolutely. Blue Dragon of the show sky. Hi sky. My connection for the next two weeks is to survive the finals. I've already talked about this. I know you can do it. You will survive.
Also shout out to their show find my dragon because they they talked a lot about this in the last episode. And as someone who did not finish college or barely even started it.
I don't know that feeling and I can only imagine what you're going through but I do hope the best and I'm glad that your first year was really enjoyable. Yes. Next connection and it comes from friend of the show Maddie. I have partially visualized my theme in my planner.
I have a page in my planner that lists out my goals, but I find my eye isn't caught by it. So I need to try something else going to use the next fortnight for that rework. I love that she put again the yellow circle orange circle. A tentative thing.
However, I think it was a successful one because you did it just because it isn't the way that it needed to work. Doesn't mean that this connection to visualize your theme was not the right way to do it.
So I would argue that you should have a green check mark, but your valid in the choice that you made. Yeah. And again, I like that we don't have any red like I just totally blew this off didn't do it completely crashed and burned like everything has been pretty good.
Including a green one from our wonderful friend Bells are else be else are Australian of the show. Yeah, our friend of the show from down under they didn't fill out the form. I'm trying to that. I have a form that says all of these different things. Sorry, I'm not making this about that.
Anyway, green check mark. I did apply for the job. I got good experience interviewing. I was rusty. I totally have been there. I didn't get it in the end, but that's okay because it wasn't for me. That's the right mindset. I love this.
This week I need to decide between two opportunities at my current job that even better. Thankfully now I know this great method now. But thankfully, I now know this great method to help make in making that decision. Are you talking about the tire method? tire method.
Are you going to look at your time intuition resources and energy to make a great decision? I love this so much. Especially, you know, just because something doesn't happen the way that you thought or what not being able to acknowledge the good pieces that come up out of it.
You know, learning about your interviewing skills and practicing on that and then possibly moving again. Oh my gosh, you poor thing.
I know that in the end, you're going to make a good decision and it sounds like you're in a position now where you're like, I feel like in the end, it's all going to be good. So I'm excited for you and I can't wait to hear more about that.

But the sponsor works too. But please, please fill people in on this project that you've been doing that got you into London. I want to know more because apparently it's been happening for a minute and I just found out. I mean, that's okay. You are very busy. We're all very busy.
And that's a hard part about me doing so many different things is that I never want to bother somebody who doesn't want to know what's going on. Every so often I think, oh, I should, you know, share out everything that I do more often, but that's really exhausting.
So instead, let me just tell you about it right now. So for the last couple of years, I have been working with a website called dragmount.com and kind of helping grow in streamline their social media presence and their content creation and kind of producing everything behind the scenes.
And helping some great content be created. And so when Amazon contacted them inviting Jason, the founder of dragmount to London and saying, hey, we know you have a big team. You can take somebody with you to go to London to be a part of the premiere and an incredible experience. And he picked me.
And so we got to go and have this absolutely incredible experience. I can't even explain how wonderful it was. Obviously, there are things that I wish I had done better because any time you do anything new, there's always going to be mental expectations that don't get met.
But it was still such an incredible experience getting to be on the red carpet that was actually blue. Getting to run around the tower of London in a costume with my hair done by the same person who does one of the actors hairs every time that he is in London.
And having a party on the top of Tower Bridge. Just incredible amount of experiences that I cannot even believe actually happened. And then that wasn't even it that like that was just the branded Amazon side of things like I was able to.
Then extend the trip and we stayed for another like six stays. And I got to hang out with so many of my incredible friends. I got to see Rosemary. I got to hang out with Serenity called well. I got to hang out with Adina and Mike. And we did some amazing things that I just like.
It was the best week of my life. So there is there's a topic that I don't think we've talked about too much. And this is why I have FOMO. This is like for those that don't know. Kathy and I had long conversations about when we were going to do a show together. Like Jay was doing a lot.
I think at the time we first started talking about the show. I had like six projects that I was working on. And Kathy was like you're doing way too much. There's no way we can focus on this. And I was like you know what? This project is so much more important than all of the other ones.
I'm going to shut everything else down. Do as I say not as I do. But see here's the thing is that like I go. It doesn't work very well if I only am on one topic or concentration. I'm sure that's probably an indicator of ADHD tendencies that I probably should get checked out working on it.
But in that time period that I was gone. I also launched a new podcast that I had been working on for about a year. Because of course I have been lucky enough to get the first six episodes of the television show. The Wheel of Time that came out on Amazon Prime. And we got to do podcasts about it.
Yeah, there's six episodes of this show that are live on the incomparable that you can find at the incomparable.com slash drag amount. Where I talk about this television show with two friends. And how excited I am. And just this.
The Wheel of Time is something that has been a part of my life for 20 years. And getting getting to talk about it and getting to have it exist outside of my circle of friends is really, really special. It's the reason that my husband and I met when our child was born.
We named them after a character from the books. And so I think that all of these things have had a huge impact on my life. And it's kind of now coming to fruition in a way that I never even imagined it would get to be.
And so when it comes to taking things out of my schedule in order to make this happen. It was a no brainer. So it's also helping me redefine what my boundaries are and what to say no at no for. And when I can say no, but still do the things that I really, really, really want to be a part of. Yeah.
And I should clarify. I'm not by any means in monitoring cat, you know, Kathy for chasing her dream and literally traveling across the world doing stuff. Yeah. No, not at all. It was, it's just funny that I think that there is a, like you said, there's a line.
There's a boundary that like you have to navigate and you have to kind of understand how to navigate it. A good example is I have a YouTube channel and, you know, I'm not a YouTuber. I'm not, I mean, I have like 400 people that follow me. Hopefully there are a few more after they hear this.
Go check through the show notes, whatever. But, you know, at the, at the end of it, it's I don't make content for growth. Like I don't, I don't do the goofy gags that everyone has become used to. In fact, sometimes I play to the exact opposite of it.
And like I talk about things that inspire me and things that I really like and I enjoy because I know that for me. And I've talked about this on other things.
My knowledge of YouTube and my knowledge of making video and knowing how to edit video, even with podcasting, knowing audio and how to edit audio has gotten me plenty of opportunities. I have one client in my little side business that I do that I've had for several years.
And just working on this newsletter for like 30 minutes a week every, you know, week for last few years. Got me on a podcast where I got to talk to the lead singer and frontman of Weezer, which is like super awesome. Mind blowing and amazing.
Like I never imagined that I would have an opportunity to be on a show with River's Cuomo and just being like. Seeing how much of a nerd he is and being able to like just nerd out about music and programming and stuff. But those opportunities only come because of the things that we make space for.
And as much as, you know, Kathy, for good reason, got onto me of like, hey, I think you're doing too much. We need to make decisions on what, you know, what we can give up and what we can't give up to make this work. I think there's also room to have discussions about like when you let things in.
And I mean, I will, I will be real like there are projects that I want to do that as I'm looking at it. It's like, I don't know if I have the time for this. And again, it's it's using that patented brought to you by conduit the podcast that teaches you all the productivity things.
That tire method of just saying like, hey, you know, as much as I have the energy for this, I don't have the time or as much as in my head, everything seems like it makes sense. But there's this little intuition bug that's like, you might want to rethink that.
Like, I have to be able to make space to listen to that and judge each new opportunity based on that merit. But also not be afraid to say, you know, hey, let's give it a shot. And even if it means like doing a small thing for a limited amount of time, like that's perfectly fine too. 100%.
 I think it's important especially for people that are multi potentialites or they can't not necessarily can't concentrate on one thing at a time, but get really bored mentally and emotionally and physically, if they're only spending a ton of time on one topic, being able to turn around and find out where it's okay to say yes.
I don't know if I can get that right. I don't know if I can get that right. I don't know if I can get that right. I don't know if I can get that right. I don't know if I can get that right. I don't know if I can get that right. I don't know if I can get that right.
I don't know if I can get that right. I don't know if I can get that right. I don't know if I can get that right. I don't know if I can get that right. I don't know if I can get that right. I don't know if I can get that right. I don't know if I can get that right.
I don't know if I can get that right. I don't know if I can get that right. I don't know if I can get that right. I don't know if I can get that right. I don't know if I can get that right. I don't know if I can get that right. I don't know if I can get that right.
I don't know if I can get that right. I don't know if I can get that right. I don't know if I can get that right. I don't know if I can get that right. I don't know if I can get that right. I don't know if I can get that right. I don't know if I can get that right.
I don't know if I can get that right. I don't know if I can get that right. I don't know if I can get that right. I don't know if I can get that right. I don't know if I can get that right. I don't know if I can get that right. I don't know if I can get that right.
I don't know if I can get that right. I don't know if I can get that right. I don't know if I can get that right. I don't know if I can get that right. I don't know if I can get that right. I don't know if I can get that right. and focusing on community as well.
All of these things have different values to me. So that I'm able to weigh them out whenever I do have to make a decision about a new project.
Hey, if I take on this new project, actually that's something that I've thought about recently too of like, Hey, if I take on a new project, what does that mean for my Tetris time? Yeah.
 One of the things my wife and I talk about a lot now that my daughter is getting older is what happens when they decide that it's a new project, when they decide that they want to do things like Girl Scouts or join a bowling league and especially that one because I want to be a part of that I want to help out with that or if they want to play a sport like all of these different things I want to be able to make time for and I have to evaluate where These things exist in my life Yeah, being a part of my kids dance Who real?
 Maybe so they they dance 10 hours a week with an additional three hours of like assisting classes And that's a lot of time and they're old enough and I mean obviously I I am not dancing with them I'm dropping them off to class But includes competitions that includes you know experiences We have a parade that we're performing in this weekend And as part of the studio I take the photos for All of these dancers and I get to be a part of the community that's involved in the studio and I have to say no to some things And learn what's important to say yes to And be able to make the adjustments to my let my life and my schedule to do these things that I think are really important We also have a Competition that the older girls are going to and I'm We also have a competition this weekend that the older dancers are Going to be competing at for championships and I am so happy to be able to go and take pictures of them But again that takes up my Saturday And I'm 100% okay with that because this is something that I love to do that fills my cup in a way That pays back the time ever and energy that I'm putting into it as well as knowing that they have the opportunity To receive these photos the last time that this team will be competing Um, and that's really special and and I didn't use the tirey method at that point Because obviously did this a while ago, but I will say that I have used it to continue to make the the specific choices of Is this what I want to do?
Yes.
Yes, it is. I think you can also look at using something like the tire method for Recurring like do I still want to do this thing? Um, and I'm sure people were like why is this episode this episode took a turn everyone was super joveal like We're still good. Well, can do real life.
Yeah, everything here is great conduit is like there There are no plans to my knowledge of conduit changing or anything like that. Oh gosh. No, this is yeah. Sorry. You're stuck with us We love you.
 Yeah, we're please please keep listening But like the the idea of that means in order for conduit to continue to be a priority that means we have to Make the decision on what things we can sacrifice and what things we can't and That is something that um As a lot of the Conductors kind of mentioned that idea of not necessarily intentionality, but also like Having it defined like hey if I have to put this project on hold I'm going to put the project on hold for the next six months so that I can wrap up some other things and make space for this new thing that happen Or hey, I have two opportunities Maybe I Think about which one is great for me now and look at how that's going to affect me in the future and make choices based on that or Maybe I do nothing for right now until I have more space to do a better job at whatever it is I want to do and I think that that's something that We often ignore in like There's a there's a saying of like um from a podcaster that I know called Justin Robert Young that talks about politics and saying like Like all politics is local politics like it's local for somebody even at like a grand stage And it's like all productivity is like future productivity the productivity that you think about now And the decision that you make now have some Effect on what's happening in the future and if you don't consider that Your your gauge for your tire your tire pressure if you will um might actually be lower or higher than What you're really believing that it is Yeah 100% And then also it's important to when you do say end up saying yes to something that you don't feel guilt Because you have to say no to something else Um or that oh gosh You say you said yes and basically just Own not own your choices because that makes it like Almost sound like a bad thing, but but being able to You know sit with the choices that you make and yes you can make adjustments as need be but But learning how you React to things and how you work through things and what the best way to make these adjustments is and see I liked it with the idea of owning it because I mean obviously we know that there are times when jago's into full ratchet mode See episode um what we're not gonna do is um I think that there's a way that you can verbalize the decisions that you've made And the decisions that you've not made Because it gives you it gives you power like if if imagine telling someone no I'm not going to do something and there are immediate responses.
Oh, but why or why not?
 Yeah where you can say Because of my current commitments I I love this idea and I wish I had more time But these other things are currently preventing me from being able to take this on or Hey, I would really love to do this, but right now I'm wrapping up this other thing Perhaps we can revisit this in a few months that sounds so much better than just Ah, I really can't right now like that means okay.
Well, when could you never some some day maybe like again I really hate some day maybe for this exact reason Because it's so vague and like I I need to know like When if if not if not now win.
 I think that's an incubus album I'm sure it probably is I definitely know those things Well, one thing I know is I I feel like I've given myself a connection for This upcoming epist or this next episode that we're gonna be doing um but uh Kathy oh no you get to go first well no I just wanted to thank you for coming back because I know like After you got onto the red carpet and stuff.
 I'm sure there were so many people that were like um, hey, I would love it for you to like Come visit the red carpet for my show and do a podcast for my thing Um, I'm totally glad that you turned them all down so that you could do this silly little show with me Hey, you know, I had already said yes to you so I got to make space to say no to other people I love it, but speaking of connections my connection for this next fortnight is Going to be to put a timeline on something Um, like I said, I don't even know what it is but I'm I'm certain that I have a bunch of stuff happening right now um, I know that I have more things happening, but I want to make sure that I have a timeline on things so that if something needs to slip I can say hey, I'm gonna let this slip after this day or hey, I'm gonna revisit this other idea on this day And I think that will help me uh make a better decision in the future.
 I love that um So my connection is kind of Now I'm just gonna so I'm going to work on Talking about all the things that I do So not just when something new comes out, but not be afraid to state how many different things That I am participating in um, I I don't keep it a secret by any means But I also have a sense of not wanting to bother people So I'm going to quote unquote bother people by letting them know about all the cool things that I do Like a podcast that I that just got published the fun the finale Of a three-part series of a D&D campaign um on total party kill called uh murder on the ever-on express Which is one of the most incredible things that I think I've ever done On a podcast.
 Sorry Jay But the ending the finale was so epic that if you have a few hours to listen to a Quote-unquote one shot even though like it takes place over three podcast episodes um I'd highly recommend you listen to this I totally forgive you because it's D&D related and that's okay you you can make time for D&D Uh, so thank you also listeners for listening to this episode um and thank you to ping them for sponsoring Condo it and this episode uh hey Jay did we can't do it?
Well, you know I would love to say we did can't do it but after looking at all of the things that we thought about and Wanting to put a realistic timeline on no, we totally condit it You
