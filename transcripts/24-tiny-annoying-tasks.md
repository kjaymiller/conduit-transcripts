From Relay F.O. you're listening to Conduit, the show we Condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show where intros are challenging and other things are too.
This episode is brought to you by Devon Technologies, I am Jay Miller, a senior cloud advocate at Microsoft. With me, as always, is the amazing wonderful Tik Tok, horrific magic soup lady. Kathy Kebble, how you doing? That's me.
We'll get into the connections and I'll talk about that title a little bit later.
But first shall we start out with a shout out? Yeah, shout out to all of the people in the Make Robo Do It Triad, the wonderful amazing groups of myself, as well as Kathy and Alex Cox, and Tiffany Armand and Julius Scott as KOTT.
And yeah, we had a lot of fun doing an amazing bonus episode for our Relay F.M. members. That's not out yet. So if you want to become a member, of course, you can sign up and still get that in your feed or you can go back and I don't know.
Listen to it later if you're listening to this in the distant future. It'll be in the cross over. Yeah, yeah, the crossover feed lots of fun played lots of games. I realized that I am bad at some of the. That was good. But I was. It was. I'm so glad that you had fun.
I was, you know, speaking of in the pre show, we were talking a little bit about nerves and I was out of my mind nervous.
Because the last time I had hosted a game of any kind was the hundredth episode of Game Show over on the incomparable where I basically meshed together a single bit of each type of podcast game show that we played. I still am slightly traumatized by it.
So this was a way to kind of get back into it to see if maybe I was ready to host the game show again. Spoiler not. But I am glad that you all had fun and I hope the listeners have fun too because now that it's over, it was fun. But it's still slight slight trauma slight trauma.
Yeah, it was it was an absolute blast. There are a lot there are tapes that were and it was it was a good time. But yeah, also I think we have some follow up to from Scott Plummer, our guitar.
So the show and says this was a great topic talking about our our last episode of of not needing gear and things to do things. As a guitarist, the GAS gear acquisition syndrome is very real. I don't need that one new piece of gear to make music.
I'm lucky enough to have more gear than a lot of people, but it is very easy to get distracted by the new shiny speaking of new gear. I am recording this on some slightly new gear. It's not the gear that I'm wanting, but it's the gear that I got for right now.
And yeah, there there was a lot of maybe I can try to do some stuff now. And I mean, no, I mean kind of I don't know things are challenging, which we'll talk about later.
But thank you so much Scott for the shout out and the acknowledgement that yes, the new shiny does make things rather complicated at times. Yeah, for sure. And I think it's something that's across every industry is something that can be really.
Like you have to recognize it and acknowledge it and then do everything that you can to not be obsessed with it. Yeah. And you may wonder where that shout out came from.
I mean, of course it came from Scott, but where did Scott put that shout out? Scott come from Scott's come from where do you grow Scott's in Scotland? Oh bad joke. No, bad. Bad. Bad. We get shout outs for people doing amazing things in the real AFM community.
You can join them and again, get all that super awesome bonus content and more things like access to our discord. By becoming a member at relay.fm slash conduit. Kathy, I think it's time to check those connections. That classic. I love it.
How did you do today or this past two weeks? Yeah, time is weird. Time is weird. It's been a fortnight since we met last. I was a little bit nervous. I was a little nervous. I was a little nervous. I was a little nervous. I was a little nervous. And my connection was getting back into TikTok.
I had done two years straight of a TikTok daily and was definitely feeling a lot of the drag. I wasn't watching TikToks a lot. I wasn't doing any of it. And I got to the point where I was like, you know what? And like having an intentionality with it. I've found more of the joy of TikTok again.
So I've done a couple. I didn't do it every day. It's more of a if I feel inspired, I will go and do it. I will watch some TikToks and be entertained. And if I see one, I will record it. That sort of thing. I was like, I'm not going to be a fan of TikTok. I'm not going to be a fan of TikTok.
But I didn't feel like I needed to scroll through and find a sound that I wanted to lip sync to. To then like. Do it and be done. Like. And so I was able to I did a photo shoot with the high school senior dancers on the dance team. And I was like, you know, an end of the year.
Here are the captains. Let's do some fun poses and all of that. And I very intentionally asked the mom that was there to help. To do some video of me taking their pictures so that I could put it together into a TikTok. And that was really fun.
And it was nice to have a true purpose for what I was putting out there. Instead of feeling a push to, oh my gosh, I have to get something out. I was able to craft something that I felt a little bit more special with almost. So I'm fighting the joy in TikTok again. Ooh, the joy in TikTok.
That is that is a nice feeling. Yeah. I like you made a TikTok focused connection, which for those listening for the first time, you might wonder what kind of show is. Where we challenge ourselves to do TikToks for two weeks. And I will say yes.
But my connection was to post my first TikTok to which I did this morning. And I was very, very anxious about it. But I knew since no one wanted to take me up on my offer for a free shout out for things, or free product promotion, which I think was good. And I want to talk about that later.
But I basically did a TikTok telling people that my connection this fortnight was to do a TikTok. So. Damn, day overcording. I love it. I love it. It was great. It was good. Thanks for tagging me so that I could see it. But I thought it was great.
And it's so amusing to me that you had no problem doing a TikTok. But we're, but you record YouTube videos. So again, I save it for the show. Yeah, I'm going to like, let's save this for the show. Let's save it for the topic. So much.
But yes, it was there is kind of what you said about having a purpose and doing a thing and realizing that purpose. I think made it a lot harder than it needed to be. Like I could have definitely had just done a TikTok. Like, but I question so many decisions.
And again, we'll talk about this in detail. But at the moment, I was happy to just get past the barrier of I'm just going to do a bad job at this and be okay that I did a bad job because you, if you start off with a bad job eventually, you just get better. And that's okay.
What about our conductors? How did they do this past fortnight? Yeah, our conductors did a great job. I'm so proud of all of them. But starting out, we've got Lewis, the planes walker of the show. Their connection check is a big green check mark with a diamond because just three words she said yes.
Yeah, we've got another engaged couple loves in the air. I can't wait to have like a couple listening like for fall up. I think that'll just be amazing. We're like, oh, we both listen to the show because it's amazing.
And like, I'm not telling you that if you are, if you have a couple that you should introduce your your significant other to the show. But wait a minute. Yes. No, I'm telling you exactly that. Tell your, tell your significant other to listen to the show. Please. Ask them kindly.
Maybe they'll enjoy it. Maybe that'll give you all a way to connect. Oh, funny. Our next connection is from Laura, our pathologist of the show, says no connection check because life. That's okay. Lots of past couple of weeks and starting new job.
Okay, you're just in the middle of your connection check. Your connection check was extended so that you could have time to get through life and starting the new job, which congratulations on starting the new job. That's, that's a lot. Yeah. And I think there's something.
Something to remember about the connections is that, you know, there's a reason that we have it set to be two weeks because, you know, that's our. That's our publishing schedule. But also, like, having. It's okay to take a fortnight off. It's okay to take a moment and say, you know, this is not.
This is not what I need to do right now. And then it also makes it easier to jump back in and come out and help. And start again. And we'll hit that in the future episode. And I think it's important to just kind of be gentle with yourself.
So once again, in our in our history of not allowing anyone to fail their connection. We're basically saying that you have successfully not done a connection as your connection. I mean, that, that tracks. Yeah.
If the folks who have been listening all 24 episodes that we've done so far have picked up on anything, it is we will not let you fail. It's not possible. You didn't fail. You just did something different. You succeeded in a different direction. There you go. Yes. Exactly.
In our discord chat of the live stream. So it says the refusal to let us fail is so affirming. And that's kind of why we do it. Like that's that's. I don't know about Jay, but that's definitely what I like. I'm imagining all of our conductors, anyone listening to this.
We're all hanging out in like a common room together. Drinking tea in front of the fire. Talking about our day or our fortnight. And if you were sitting here one on one, my friend, like we would be. I would be lifting you up. However it needs to do like whatever you need in this moment.
And sometimes it's just that that affirmation that hey. Just like Skye says failure is an option, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. It's like failing at something doesn't mean you're a failure. So you're great. And so it's she does whose connection check has a big green circle.
They've documented the bits of the job that they don't like so that they can pass them on. They're very looking forward to actually passing things over next week. So exciting. That's amazing. You're the best hard advocate of the show. And we're so happy for you, especially because it's so close.
It's so soon you're going to be done with those parts. So soon. So soon. So soon. Our next one comes from Scott. Okay, see now you're going to now you're just testing us a connection check no check red circle. I doubt it.
I've been putting a lot of stress and pressure on myself to meet my connection. So I decided to give myself a break this fortnight. Okay, let me be the second because Kathy so eloquently put it first. No, pressure is not this isn't a pressure thing. This isn't accountability thing.
This is yes, this is very much the if if the thing doesn't happen that's okay as long as you can not say I forgot about it. Like that's even if you say you forgot about it. I mean, if other things happened cool, that's fine.
But the the ultimate goal, even even for me and my little TikToks like I spent two weeks thinking about what TikTok to make because I knew that if it wasn't a thing that I had to do. I wouldn't be thinking about doing a TikTok at all.
And that's that's the whole point of this is if you say I really want to put some time and energy into doing this thing for the next two weeks. That now has given you a spot where you can you can you know, proclaim that to the masses of people that are conductors and listeners to condo it.
And now that gives you permission to be thinking about that thing. If you don't do it, that's fine. But at least you now have space and you've made space to at least give yourself time to think about it.
And I mean, to me, I love that you were like giving myself too much pressure, too much stress involved in this. I'm going to give myself a break. Absolutely 100%. You can change your connection if you want in the middle of it to just be like, I want a break for two weeks. And that's perfectly okay.
So green circle. You just have to change your connection without telling anybody. Yeah, which is 100% okay. In fact, I think there was an episode of this show when we changed the connection or reworked it in the fortnight because guess what that's okay to this is not written in blood.
There's no like soul binding contract with your connection, whatever you end up doing. Like again, it's it's an accountability thing and an awareness thing and an intentionality thing.
That's our goal is to let you like think about what you're doing a little bit more in a little bit of a different way, which means you're all doing so great. It's a proud of you. Ha ha. All right. So connection check has a yellow heart. They had a great webinar and destroyed that devil spaghetti.
Yeah, you did. But they've been so busy that they haven't done anything with the house cleaning project. So just like, you know, our previous things, you changed your connection to just be destroying the devil spaghetti. That imposter is down. And and that's good to go.
So don't worry about like your your the house cleaning project is there. Yes. So you do get a green because you successfully had an incredible webinar and beat that. So that second part is just moved down the line. That's all.
There's only one person who doesn't get a green and that's because they get a blue sky. I'm not sure the blue dragon of the show tied up some loose ends and tried to DM a former friend to figure out that they had been blocked. Oh, tough. At least you tied up the loose ends.
And you know that some some things have to happen that way. I I definitely feel you on that. Well, and if like now you don't have to wonder about that former friend, because your block like they've blocked you, which is there. Whatever's going on that's their thing.
And now you can leave your concentration on friends that aren't blocking you. Yeah, it's. It is tough. I know that. Yeah, growth is hard. I've I've definitely had to deal with some similar stuff. And heart heart totally goes out to you.
Especially when you know your your ideas like, yeah, let's let's catch up. Yeah, I know. But that's okay. I mean, now you have space to put more people who love you and into that spot.
And hopefully hopefully we can work to fill some of that space and and continue to fill it and fill it and fill it. Yeah. And then that's a good question. We're going to do a little bit more of a little bit of our budget master of the show comes in with a red diamond. Another new job started.
So the hunt for solid ground begins again distinctly feel like almost all areas of life and more crumbling and haunted. All right. So it sounds like there's a lot going on that's not spiraling necessarily.
I think we're going to have a lunch coming which isn't a great place for brains to be because brains are dumb. And I know in my past when I've had a lot of things going on, I tend to like get in that loop of like just feeling like everything is crumbling all the time.
helped with me is if I'm journaling and just getting everything out, no judgment, I don't even reread it, just like writing all of the thoughts and feelings that are going in my brain.
I did this a lot when Ryan was in the hospital just because my brain would kept visualizing all of the bad things that would happen. And like, I would go through all of the contingency plans, like if a happened, then I would do b.
Sometimes that's not helpful for some people's brains, but for me it meant that even though I didn't know what was happening in the future, I could do some basic planning.
And then I would also find one little thing that I could successfully complete, whether it was unpacking a box or rearranging a kitchen cabinet or something very basic, remake the bed, like wash the sheets and make the bed.
Sometimes having that one thing being finished meant that I didn't feel as much of a failure for the day, especially when a lot of things are things that you can't necessarily control the outcome. And so we believe in you, you can do it tomorrow is another day.
Yeah, I mean, echoing everything that Kathy said, but I mean, this is this is where hopefully, hopefully just having friends to continue to to be that that light of positivity, that light of, you know, living outside of the situation can definitely help with that too.
And that's why we enjoy being here. And you know, if you're having a moment where you're like, ah, there's a lot of stuff happening. You can share some of those things to your comfort level with us.
And, and you know, with the entire, you know, the break room and system and themes family and things.
 And I think that that can provide a little bit of solace, but I, but also, I mean, if you look, if you, you know, if you have the time, go back and listen to like episode two of the show where we talked about like when you can't even or odd like, yes, how do you, how do you work on those things and remember that, you know, as much as we talk about tire and making decisions, tires can deflate.
So if, if you're working on a deflated tire, you can't go as fast. So slow down a little bit. And then when you have the time, stop, re-inflate that tire, get right back onto it and get back into the natural swing of things.
But until then, again, you've got plenty of friends that you can call on and, and of course, we're all here at some capacity to, to be as helpful as we can. It is my turn. So we're going to say Deborah, our soprano of the show says retirement party, planning is in progress.
So yellow check, which is good. But it turns out the most difficult part is finding a suitable date. Isn't that always the case? Because the obvious choice is Father's Day. So that's not a good idea. Yeah, planning is hard. Even planning to plan is hard. And finding a date for anything. Oh my gosh.
Yeah. If there's more than two people, it's always, it's always hard. But you've got this. You can do it. Yeah. And check, check with people. It may be that having it on Father's Day might be okay, especially if people's plans for Father's Day are more towards the evening.
You can't do more than one thing a day. I know it's really overwhelming and Sundays are hard. But that's an option, especially if you can't find another day that would work.
All right, Kate's connection check is a big green book because they have done all of the end of the month, final deadlines and managed a time. And so they weren't rushed to submit in the last few minutes. Holy cow. You did it, Kate. Yeah. You con did it. We're so proud of you.
This journey has been so long. I can't even imagine being on your side of things. I know that I've been like stressed for you. So seeing that you finished it is incredible. You are so talented. And I'm so proud of you. And I love that Kate is also in the live chat with us.
So it's not just us celebrating with them. It is all of all of our friends as well celebrating too. So this is this is awesome. Yeah. Congratulations. Our fancy music boy of the show, Ryan says connection check the road trip was successful. Yay. But I did bring home COVID. Oh no.
You are doing fine now, which is good. And I can only say speedy recoveries. I hope that you get better. Get well soon. I hope everyone in the family is also doing well as well. And I'm glad that the road trip went well. Like that's good. No flat tires or car accidents or anything like that.
All right. Our hello of the show, John Boe connected check green check not checked in for a while. It's been a stressful few months with work and wedding stuff. They are now three months away from the big day. Lots of things have been dealt with just the little things left just sort now.
Oh my gosh, those little things I swear. They come out. I know where and you're like, how did I forget X? Why did I think of Y? But guess what? As long as you both say I do and are married at the end of the day, it is successful. So you can do it.
Here's here was my secret tip for avoiding the little things at the wedding. Be a marine and have your platoon be your event planning team because nice they refused to let anything little get in the way. That might be a little bit hard with only three months.
Yeah, I think you'll come a little bit longer. Yeah. But for the future for the future plans. This episode of Condo it is brought to you by Devon THING, the FLAGESHIP product from Devon Technologies. Devon THING is the most professional document and information management application for the Mac.

Kathy, this Fortnite has been hard because my brain, it'd be challenging at times. So I have a question, why is making a TikTok so difficult? I don't know because I don't have that problem. But what I can say is that there's a lot of issues like brains are dumb, brains are weird.
And they put up these barriers that are ridiculous. I mean, it's weird in the time that I did one video, one TikTok, I built an entire web app. I actually built two. Like it, I mean, like thousands of lines of code. And it was so challenging to do a 45 second video.
What the heck? Like I have no words. Yeah. And you kind of mentioned before, like, hey, I do YouTube video for living. I do get on stage and talk to people and making presentations. I am not uncomfortable being on video, but at the same time, like one, there were no dances to there were no music.
It was literally think of something, do something, the something is done. And I locked up for days. So for one of my clients, there's a task that I do once a month. I put together like automated email, like a printed letter.
And I print it out, I print out the envelope with the the postage and I mail it. It takes next to no brain function to do this. But the first couple months that I was doing it, I would put it off and put it off and just like not do it because my brain was like, oh, I don't want to do it.
Um, and then I like hired out part of it. Like the actual compilation of the letters, which meant all I had to do was copy and paste the address for printing the envelope and print out the letter.
This still apparently is really hard for my brain, but even harder when my fricking printer decides that it doesn't want to work. It's fine. Guess how many times I've restarted my computer today? One more than you should have. Let's say eight times. Oi, that's that's no good.
Why print? And it's still not working. Why are printers? I think there was actually a tick talk about that of like, why do we still need printers? It's 2022. I know. Should I have to print anything? It's ridiculous. But it's fine.
I wonder if part of it is the professional versus personal side of it. I mean, I know we've talked during the show and in the after shows about, you know, the idea of being a quote unquote professional podcasters and doing things like this for our job.
And, you know, with my job, I, you know, I get on stage and I make video content and I do all this stuff and I do it in this professional space. And I've always pitched it as you learn for free and then you get paid to do the thing and then you just get better at doing it over time.
But I think I think there's something about like once, once you are now getting paid to do the thing, doing the thing for fun or for free or just because it's a new thing to learn and it's kind of in that space, I think it challenges us to try and figure out where, where do we go from there?
Like, how is this going to radically change my entire process? Because again, if I post a silly tick talk and it, you know, goes viral, which I don't want it to, please, please, I don't want viral.
Unless it's on my, unless it's on my company's like account, then yes, please go viral. That that gives me bonuses and things.
But like, if, if I do a thing and there's a huge like positive feedback or a huge negative feedback even in that, in that space, I now have to start thinking about that process.
And I think that, you know, even with yours of like, okay, I have to do like a shipping label and printing things and all this other stuff.
There are so many services now that are like, oh, it's, you know, I'm not going to say any out loud, but there's one that is the thing that you put on a letter.com.
And like all of this other stuff that you do, and the second you're doing it, and you're like, oh, this is such an easy thing to do, but I don't feel like I did it well. It opens the door for you to start questioning whether or not you need to just reevaluate everything.
Well, and it's also like, who am I to expect my printer to work? Like, how dare I expect my technology to do the thing? And also like, why am I doing this? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? But also brains, brains, brains, brains are special.
And it's, it's interesting when you have, when you, it's, it's really interesting when you can find something that's blocking your brain. And something that is making you like, want to stay away.
And recognizing that to the point where you can see if you can realize it and figure out how to get past that block. Do you think it's a, is it like a, like, you lose either way if you, if you, if you do it so easily, it's like, well, that was easy.
And like, okay, I lost now because I spent so much time thinking about it and like, it being challenging that like, I feel like I lost.
Or if it was indeed challenging, then it's just validation and kind of feeding that, the impot spaghetti like, I, I think it's almost just like, there's no, there's no winning.
Because when you finish it, you're, you're like, why did I wait so long? Or if you end up having trouble, you're still like, oh, if I had started this before, I would be done sooner. But either way, once it's done and complete, I feel so much lighter.
And it makes me wonder, why did I wait two weeks to do this thing? And ask me if I've learned my lesson. Have you learned how to listen? No, no, no, I have not because I'm still doing it, even when I'm recognizing it. But to be fair, I have started recognizing it a little bit earlier.
So it seems to be hopefully maybe by the time I'm 80, I will have fewer concerns. But probably not. I mean, I mean, that's a feeling like, I still think for me a lot of this is me feeling like I have to be not great at everything I do.
But I have to be great at everything that's lightly adjacent to what I'm doing in my day to day, which is a battle. I will eventually give up on. So I'm wondering if because it's not the getting on camera, but I wonder if because it's such a short form because you have that 15 seconds.
But also you normally will have like all of the time and energy to put into a script and a set and lighting and all of this for like a true YouTube video. It almost seems like it's there's no way it could be the simple.
And also because you've done all of the bigger things already, and you have the experience with YouTube, well then when you see the TikTok and it's not a YouTube video quality or whatever, your brain is like, oh, well, that was dumb.
Oh, I can I can't even begin to tell you the obvious looking at my phone's camera quality and just being like, I hate this. I don't know what this did, but I hate it. It's doing some software stuff that I'm not a fan of.
 And I don't like there was a lot of like every little moment in doing the thing knowing that if I had more time or if I if I gave myself more focus on this, you know, going back to what we talked about with with the connection checks of like, this is a space where you now have permission to think about this thing, but you know, we have space to think about it.
We don't have all the space in the world. We don't have all the time in the world.
I don't have, you know, Kathy messaging me every day, like I do, you know, at work where someone saying, hey, how's it going working on this project or have you thought about doing this?
 If I got to make one TikTok every two weeks and then like, I got to run it by Kathy and did a script for it and did proper camera footage and then bounce that back off and then did like pre roll and then do all this other stuff and then spend a bunch of time focusing on a description and proper links and all of that jazz.
Like, oh, this would be a completely different story because there's checkpoints throughout the way. But but also I think that no one would ever do TikToks. No, that's here's the thing though is that there's a lot of people that do that level of TikToking. Like a huge number of people.
I can't even, I will watch a lot of behind the scenes TikToks for filming TikToks. Yes, yes. I'm aware of how that sounds. But it's, there are a lot of people that they spend their full day making a TikTok and I'm just like, wow, I'm so impressed. Yeah, it's interesting.
Sof in the in the live stream chat has a note about like a good procrastination checklist from an ADHD app which if you can remember the name that would be incredible. I would love to see that. But the the key part was identifying smaller steps to the goal.
Like that part like really, really tickled my brain of like, oh, if I make these tiny tasks, it's a lot like, you know, okay, I need to clean my house. Well, what does that mean? Like, what what I can't check that off.
I can't work towards that task because I don't know what exactly the structure of it is. Obviously, that doesn't necessarily help with something like making a TikTok, but also it could maybe.
So I don't know, I like that, that as a reminder of like finding the smaller steps, but also the rest of the the bits that they put saying as that procrastination checklist is really interesting.
I want to learn more about it, shall we say? So I love that that Sof brought up a good way to start focusing on getting past it.
And for folks listening, our hope here is that you are witty enough to substitute making TikToks with whatever that simple, small brain blocking task is that that you have. And let's let's talk about ways to get past it.
And at the end of the day, the thing that got that convinced me to just do the thing was the timeline. Yeah, was the timeline was like, hey, I have to, well, I mean, that's that's I can't even say that that's truly fair because I worked on this up until like I thought about it last night.
I spent like a good like 30 minutes thinking about what I was going to say in that like 45 second TikTok, which is funny because all it was was literally, hey, I do a show where we challenge ourselves to do something every two weeks. And the challenge was to do a TikTok. And I did it.
So like even even that took a bunch of time to get to that point. But at the end of the day, I remembered something that came from my time in the Marine Corps, not just in wedding planning. But that I follow in life. And that's nobody, nobody is getting unalived from this, from doing this thing.
Yeah. And we're talking about stuff that is simple, trivial, and that at the end of the day, may not even really matter. Or it does matter and it's super important, but it's also not a challenge. And you don't have to do the best job.
I have I have convinced myself that doing C plus work turns out to actually be A plus work because in most cases, people just don't do the work. Yeah. So in my head of like if I just do the thing, it doesn't have to be great.
I'm not going to lose my job over my little promotion of my own show that I do. Like no one's going to get mad. I mean, oh, you did a bad TikTok. How dare you? Like that's not going to happen. So at the end of the day, just take your glasses off because they're consistently dirty.
And put the camera on. Think about all the stuff that people who have done TikToks professionally have said that you remembered, which was basically like, put yourself in like the lower third of the screen. That way, there's space for people to be above you next to you, whatever.
And then just do the thing. And if it's horrible, it's horrible. Oh, well, three people are going to see it anyway. At the end of the day, your first TikTok, nobody will see it's, you know, your millionth TikTok. Very few people will probably see.
More people will probably see it than the first one. But honestly, the stakes are so low. Just do it. And then once it's done, celebrate the crap out of it. Like you did the thing. You do the powerful thing.
Like if you don't celebrate it, then it doesn't, like it doesn't give you that sense of victory. It just gives you the sense of, oh, finally, that's over. Like, no, celebrated that way. You get that dopamine hit that allows you to be like, okay, next time, I'm going to do it.
But then I'm going to do this, this, this, and this. And like, you're encouraged to do it again. That way, you get that same dopamine hit. Yeah. And, and a reminder that done is better than perfect because you won't get perfect. So get it done. Make it work. Make it right. Make it fast.
That is, that is the phrasing that we use. Make it work. Make it right. Make it fast. And I think we've done that. I think we've made this show work. Do we make it right, though? I don't know. We shall see with our connections.
So, Kathy, what is your connection for this upcoming Fortnite? This Fortnite, I need to make two different appointments. I need to call our PESC guy. And I need to make an appointment for my jaw. If I open my mouth, so I've always had a problem with like when I open my mouth, my jaw pops.
For the last three weeks or so, it now hurts when it pops. And yes, I said three weeks. I know I should have done it beforehand, but I need some accountability to do it. So that's going to be, I'm going to call for the two appointments that I need to call for and get things scheduled.
Well, one, you're not allowed to talk anymore for the rest of the show. No, it's only if I open my mouth really wide. Oh, don't do that. You're not allowed to say, Boolean. I totally get it.
And I am happy that you have leaned on us to be your, your accountability pals here and like everyone bug Kathy to make these calls because otherwise, she may not ever be able to talk again. And I don't know if we could listen, I've been talking for three weeks just fine.
Just because I have to take care of that in the morning and at night and have an ice pack. Listen, it's fine. It's fine. I'm only bleeding from the jaw, but you know, it's perfectly fine. It's but a scratch. My jaw is only dislocated from from the rest of my skull, but I'm fine. Hi.
What's your connection, Jay? So I teased that I have been working on a web app and it's actually a web app that has existed as long as this show has existed, I believe, are just about as long. But I had to do some moving of things and making better of things.
But my job is to build things like this and talk about them. I built the thing. I got to get to talking about it. So that's going to be, that's going to be my goal is to talk about the thing. I don't have a link for for folks yet. There will be a link in the next two weeks.
Yeah, because you can't talk about the thing if people can't find the thing. Yeah, technically, it's on the internet. Technically, you can get it, but ultimately, it's it's not in a very easy defined spot.
And for those that are just dying or unaliving to know, I don't know if that's a phrase, but for people who are desperate to know. Yeah, for people who really, really want to know, this is for diversity orgs.
tech, which is the app that I made a few years ago that helps underrepresented folks find organizations in tech that cater to them as underrepresented folks.
So think of it as meetup, but for communities of people who have some of the same experiences that you do and some of the same backgrounds and lives that you do. So again, I've made it significantly better in some ways and slightly not as better in other ways, but it's a progress. It's a journey.
I want to make it available for people to use again. I want to make it available for people to contribute to again so that organizations can start adding their groups, their user groups and stuff to the site. And again, I can't do any of that.
And also, I can't get paid to work on it if I don't talk about it and I don't talk about some of the technology that went to making it a reality. So I got to do that. So I mean, I'm your co-host and I didn't know about it. So I'm just saying low bar.
Yeah, it's very much a feeling of I will talk about it more in detail on the the show next time. But I also need to talk about it in my official capacity in the next couple of weeks. So I will do that. Perfect. What about our conductors? What they got to do? Yeah.
Our pathologist of the show, Laura, her new connection is because of the new routines around her job. She's gotten out of some habits and want to get back into it, including regular intentional movement, AKA exercise, but the word intimidates me.
Yes, I'm going to pause this connection right here and say I love intentional movement instead of exercise because that can be anything doesn't have to be, you know, a peloton workout or fitness, like going for a walk, intentional movement, just move your body. Perfect. Love that.
Anyways, continuing on. She'd like to do some kind of intentional movement three days a week for the next two weeks and see how it goes. More on the list, but starting here. And then a PS what she's working towards is getting back into the three M's of what she needs for her brain to be okay.
Meds, movement and meditation also sleep, but hasn't figured out how to make that catchy yet. So any M words for sleep? Let us know. I said melatonin possibly, but I don't love it. So you forgot the prop, which is tacos and sushi. That's not an M sure it is. It's a meal. Oh, okay. Okay.
Yeah, we'll see. We'll see. You can do it. Our entire advocate of the show, Chintas says next connection, cook three new things that I haven't made before. I feel like I've been in a bit of a rut with food lately and I would like to mix things up. Ah, so you can't do it.
I encourage you to cook one new thing. And then if that works, cook a two new thing and then that works. Cook a three new thing. Ah, ah, ah. Yes. I wish one of these days we'll talk about my cooking. I'm a great cook. I can do all of the things, but I hate it.
So I don't like to, which means I don't. That's going to be a whole new connection in the future. I'm sure. But until then, Scott's, our guitarist of the show, Scott's next connection is no new connection because no connection equals stress reduction. I love that.
Can't wait to give you a big green checkmarked in two weeks. I also love that your connection is to not be connected. That will be great. Our Oracle of the show.
So their connection is I've let meditating and exercising slide during the last busy a couple of weeks for the next fortnight, aiming to meditate three times a week. Everyone is being so ambitious. I love it. I love it. I am, I am weak. My body is weak. Therefore, I am like one of everything.
But three times a week, an exercise twice a week just to get back on the wagon. Yes, you can do this. So I believe in you. Absolutely. Our blue dragon of the show sky. Their next connection is to finish a secret script for a secret project, Winky face. New podcast alert.
I am so excited to find out what this is and I hope we learn soon, but you can do it. Sky. I know nothing. If this is a new podcast, I was not given insider information. That being said, I hope it's a new podcast.
If it's not a new podcast, people write scripts for podcasts all the time, all the time. But clearly not sky. So it's not a podcast. Oh, cool. That's okay. We'll be excited for whatever it is. Yes, we will be excited.
I was surprised to know that the show Deborah says adjust the routine to prepare for going back into the office mostly full time because I'll likely have a summer intern assigned next week. And they'll need a mentor in the office. That is, that's interesting. That's cool.
I've never been able to work with an intern. And there's so much there that I might have questions. I'm so excited for you. Like that's going to be a whole different dynamic. And it makes it worth it to go into the office, I think, to be able to help them. So I can't wait to hear that.
How that goes. All right, Kate's new connection is to have a more relaxed fortnight, but also prep the pages on their website for their master's projects.
And for the end of this year's show, if they ever tell them what they need, it sounds like your people in charge need to make a connection and decide what's needed for the end of your show. Have your people talk to our people? Or at least just listen to the show.
Maybe, maybe you'll get on board with getting everyone the information that's needed. Exactly. But also in the vein of how our show has been talking about doing the simplest of things, maybe there's a way of encouraging them to do the simple thing of telling people what they need.
I'm not sure, but I know that once you have all the things that you need, you can do it. And last but certainly not least, our hello of the show, John Bo says, need to put all of my notes together and make the best speech that he can.
Can't wait to stand in front of all the friends and family crying about how much he loves his bride to be. So good. So sweet. Again, hire Marines. We'll figure it out. No, no, don't, don't do that. There might be more profanity in there than you would expect. I'm so excited for you.
I can't wait to hear how it goes. I have two weddings that I'm going to this year and I'm so excited for both of them because I, well, one of them I'm attending as a guest without being a photographer. And that's going to be really exciting. It's been a long time. Nice.
