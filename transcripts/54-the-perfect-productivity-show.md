From Relay FM, you're listening to Conduid, the show where we conduit our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduid, the show that brings a little bit of chaos into whatever your day may be. This episode is brought to you by Memberful and HelloFresh.
I'm Kathy, and with me today is my favorite Conduid co-host who is also as exhausted as I sound, Jay Miller. We only bring the chaos every 54 episodes annually. Yeah, that is a reference to our topic, but we're not there yet. Let's check out in the discord the last two weeks. We're beautiful chaos.
We learned that there is an official IKEA mascot in Japan that is the Blaha in a suit. There is a scrub daddy IPA if you feel like you.
Johnny Cube spread throughout the discord like a virus, including making an appearance on Apple Watch bands and a story time that involved mailing a letter with the Johnny Cube sticker to Tim Cook.
Also the quote-unquote new Relay FM logo, Relay FM switch on logo was released as a joke, purely a joke in response to the X logo, which is apparently what Twitter is now being called, but you're still tweet and all of this stuff is on Twitter. Listen, we don't need to question anything there.
But when do we say chaos, check out the chaos in the discord. I mean, technically if the X logo is 10, could the Relay RB3? I don't know. I'm trying to see what the closest character to our fancy cool new logo.
Also I heard you say scrub daddy IPA, which is definitely just bonkers, but in my head I thought scrub daddy IPO. Closing my bank account. Let's talk about what happened in the co-working session. Things have been going great. We were kind of having a chill day for our co-working session.
Then Jay came in with the chaos because that's what he does. And then I proceeded to like just obliterate things and ask all the questions of Kathy. Since Kathy was super busy, it's all coming back to me now. Kathy was super busy and needed a distraction.
The team of Jay and co-working companions were able to keep Kathy adequately distracted so that she could do her work. If you want to become a member of the Relay FM, switch on superconductor power on. Amazing family. I give up. Give us money. I'm a superconductor.com.
That's letter I letter M letter A superconductor.com. I don't know what's wrong with Jay, but we're just going to continue one. I hit my knee again. What? Javier, please keep this in. I have nothing for you. I'm sorry.
Instead, we're going to move on to shout outs where I have a shout out to two people in the chat, as well as 24 other people that hung out in person with me in Portland, including James Thompson and Erica. Nobody told me I know because it was an incomparable thing.
I've been uncomfortable once twice because I was on the game show. Yes, but we had a big get together and it was glorious and amazing and absolutely incredible. And it's so great to see people in person that you have either only hung out with online or. It's been more than seven years.
Yeah, so that was fun. They also brought so much love and support into the stressful planning side of things, which was wonderful. But yeah, I got to unicorn all over the weekend and it was glorious. And I can't believe it's over. When life sucks, just unicorn all over the weekend. There we go.
There's photos. What is this? What? I can't even. Can't audio. I know. I know. Now, now I'm hurt physically because I banked my knee on my desk twice since we started doing this show. I don't have a shout out.
Yeah, shout out to all the super awesome people hanging out with this live in the chat who are having a great time at our expense. Yes. Excellent. All right. How about a connection check? Ow. That. Jay, how'd you do? Yeah, my connection was to get my internet connected in my potential new house.
And they haven't canceled their internet yet. So I cannot get internet yet. But I did take that as an opportunity to get all the other things switched on really FM. And so I gave myself a yellow or orange circle. It wasn't for lack of trying. I merely just like logistically could not do it.
Yeah, don't make sense. I almost yeah. Yellow. Good job. I have a big green check mark because the vibes as they say were immaculate and everyone that was there for the incomparable weekend is sick of me saying that because I said it a billion times.
Apparently that came out in 1950 for like it was a phrase that became popular then. And I don't remember why but there was a story on Wikipedia. So, you know, it's real. Absolute truth. But yes, big green check mark. And then this past weekend, I also had immaculate vibes.
It was a weekend of glorious girl power. We saw the Barbie movie on Friday. Saturday, we were going to go to the Korean baseball, but instead decided to go see six the musical on closing weekend. And then Sunday, we saw Taylor Swift. We got home last night at 8.30 pm after getting home at 2.30 a.m.
after Taylor. So we're exhausted. And that's okay because I'm here with my friends. And that's that's a good part. Should we do our conductors connections? Yes, I just want people to realize that Kathy leads a very super fascinating life.
I, on the other hand, have been putting things in boxes for the last week. Which is also fascinating. My body is so sore. It hurts everything hurts. I have paper cuts. Oh, no. Okay, now, now I'm just milking pity.
Yeah, let's, let's, yeah, what, what, what do the conductors be doing? I have to tell you as soon as I can get back to our super awesome doc.
And let's start with the soprano of the show, Debo, that says green heart, I contacted power washers, porch painters, and in the process of getting work scheduled, I read that as an M and, and, and the princess of getting work scheduled. So congratulations, your highness on getting more scheduled.
Our mountain dweller of the show, Logan has green heart. Sorry, sorry, Logan, I got nothing this time. It's, it's fine. All the celebrations were had and we're all fun. Excellent.
Our Oracle of the show, so says green apple, been spending 15 minutes on my journal articles most days can confirm because so did that in our super awesome conductor, co working session. It's an awesome creativity hack and a long way from finished but making progress. Yes. Excellent.
Our panda of the show James says green check mark with the unicorn emoji. I had an excellent time on my trip to Portland and some of my favorite people in the world, including actually living in the same house with one Kathy Campbell and the rest of the main house. Surprise.
Well, not a surprise to Kathy, but it was so good to see everyone in person and just hang out. Absolutely. I love the fraternity sorority vibes when you when you shout main house. Yes.
Well, that's because so there were three we stayed in three separate air being bees with the group of people and we had main house elegant house and quiet house. And the main house energy was very particular. You had to be there, but if you were there, you'll never forget it.
Oh, I totally wish I was there. Speaking of someone who was there. You couldn't come anyways. Okay. The Canadian trivia card enthusiast of the show. Erica says green tree survived the road trip somewhere and got to see a unicorn and a panda.
Okay, now you're all just rubbing it in and it's not fair and I don't like it. Didn't overdo it and came home healthy but tired. I love this for y'all. I'm so excited. If one more person talks about it in these connection checks, I'm ending this show.
No one else is talking about it in the connection check, but also you missed the very important line from Erica about the multiple flights of tiny adorable cocktails because in Portland, there is a cocktail bar that is sponsored by a specific vodka company.
I don't remember the name of the vodka, but I remember the name of the bar. I don't know what you can go and they have like they call them like tiny cocktails, many cocktails. They are basically like a third the size of a regular drink, but always incredible different flavors.
So you can try a bunch of little ones. And yes, I think you're right, Erica, drags vodka, but they had like. They had a little dill pickle flavored. They had like fruit loops cereal. An orange cream sickle like blended thing. And then some of the proceeds help underprivileged youth in Portland.
Yeah, Chinese five spice. All sorts of different flavors with little things on top. And with a couple little plastic mermaids, it was just an absolute delight. If you are in Portland and have a chance to go to Chinese or Teenies, it's T I and I apostrophe S highly recommend so much fun.
And more and more of us showed up at like it started with just a net and I and then it they the people kept coming and we ended up with like. Half of the group around this tiny little place that was super empty. So it was super fun. Highly enjoy it.
Anyways, moving on the name list of the show has a green square. I was successful in exercising self control regarding screen time while at work. Instead of having video shows and movies playing in the background, I primarily chose to listen to music.
I also discovered that I could enhance my focus on important tasks by using white noise when necessary before switching back to music. Also, Mocha and I have gone to our first puppy trading class. Very important update to this as well.
Mocha made an appearance on the co working meeting and she is very pleased. At first I thought you were going to say that Mocha also was important. Our training thing is the show. Relsy says it appears I have stopped stealing everyone's sleep back into the swing of work. That's okay. That's okay.
You're it's I'm sure the the sleep that you borrowed from people you didn't steal it you borrowed it. I'm sure this people are happy to have it back, but also it sounds like it was much needed. Good job. Absolutely. Okay, so this episode is going to be a little bit different. Just a little bit.
Then pretty much everything else. Ever. And that you've ever heard. And not just because our brains are in a very special place right now. But we last night I went into the discord and was like, hey, y'all, I'm exhausted. And Jay is slightly stressed for many different reasons. Just slightly.
Just slightly. And we were like, does anyone have a topic idea or like an AMA? The problem with an AMA is that you usually have to do like a lot of questions because most of the questions end up being fairly like short. So in order to have like a full episode, you would need a ton of them.
However, our conductors are the absolute best and came through with some incredible questions. We have put the list of everything into the spreadsheet. And we picked three to kind of delve in. So it's going to be a little bit of a mix of a show.
But we're calling this, well, Jay is calling this the first annual parentheses. Probably conductor questions, Strava, Ganza. I'm not sold on the name only because the annual word, which means that it's a year.
He wants to do it every 54 episodes, which is not a year because we're a fortnightly show. Even if we were a weekly show, there's only 52 weeks a year. Right. So like what we're saying is we have no idea what this is going to be called. We don't know if we will ever do it again.
But you get that now. And that is the important part of things. So we're going to start with this first incredible question from Sof are Oracle of the show. She says they say, conduit is so different from most productivity shows out there.
It's real and personal and brave and both your personalities shine through, including your will and it willingness to take different paths from the old over trodden ones.
What gave you the courage to start and continue conduit? I'm guessing you knew it would be different in everything from conductor's connections to the topics you talk about.
How do you avoid giving into the pressure to be just another productivity show? Love someone who is also trying to walk a different path. Do you want to go first or do you want me to? I mean, we can we can kind of.
Yeah, so this the show started because we were frustrated and annoyed with the entire productivity like space. It's a racket. It is a racket.
Most of the productivity gurus out there make their money by being by talking about productivity, which is difficult because they are trying different things in order to talk about them. It's not no hate or shade to the rest of the world for productivity like podcasts and stuff out there.
Now we because listen, no, we are supporting other people. However, however, we want to do something different because we we are different. We don't make we are not like officially full time productivity peoples.
And so everything that we end up talking about is is real because it's journeys and things that we are discovering ourselves, not in a journey to be productive necessarily, although obviously that is a goal. But in order like we are living our lives. We are getting stuff done.
In the non non trademark non trademark. Oh yeah, because it's stuff not not things. So yeah, that's a that's a new getting stuff done copyright 2023 trademark really FM switch on conduit by the way. And about nine years ago, I had a blog that no longer exists that was called keeping junk managed.
Amazing. Yeah. So I think there's like two big things for me on this like one. Kathy is right about the frustration part. There is a part of me that was frustrated with myself because hey, I did a productivity show before then.
And at times, I mean, granted will say that I was significantly younger, much less stressed and very naive about the just the realities like I believe that yes. There was some secret recipe of apps gadgets and do ads that would make your life easy based on people who again do this full time.
And I would definitely say that those people paying a rosier picture than what life actually looks like when you're when you're paid to be productive. You don't talk about the times in which you're not very often. And when you do.
It is done in a way that it's it's so rare that people feel like it's just the outlier. It's like one of those things where like super, super successful person does a lot of drugs and you're like, wow, wow, that's real. That's super.
It's like, no, that's no like what they've done is they've they've positioned the bad thing in a way that's kind of minor in the grand scheme of a thing when it's really just a bad thing.
And what I noticed, you know, doing my own show for five years, I think it was like five or six years was that people benefited from not feeling alone. People benefited from not thinking something was wrong with them because that was that's the problem.
 People go to these productivity, you know, podcasts and videos and all this other stuff and they go, there must be something wrong with what I'm doing or there must be something wrong with me because I can't get the same output or productivity as this person who, you know, gets on a show every week and makes tens of thousands of dollars just talking about how he's able to or how they're able to accomplish so many things.
I mean, let's be honest, it usually is a key. I mean, I'm not, yeah, you're not wrong. So I think I originally reached out on, I guess what's now called X, I'm just going to call it Twitter, I don't care.
I reached out on Twitter about like, hey, I want to do a show, but I want a co-host because I can only bring my perspective and I would really love a second consistent perspective. At the same time, I believe Kathy sent out a tweet about, hey, would love to do a productivity show, it felt real.
And I had known Kathy from before because I had worked with Kathy previously and I was a big fan and was like, oh, this is perfect. I was like, there's no way Kathy would ever want to do this. And then in the end, Kathy was like, yeah, it sounds cool.
And the rest is their story, I guess, I don't know. Yeah. Something like that. Yeah. And there's something to be said for trying to make sure that we are not the manufactured. What's it called? You're faking mistakes or like.
So Rachel Hollis is a perfect example of this type of person where they are like, she starts out, you know, she does a podcast of YouTube and stuff. And I don't watch her. I tend to watch commentary channels talk about her so she doesn't get my views. But it's like a manufactured mistakes.
Like, oh, my gosh, I have so silly. I use toothpaste instead of sunscreen. So anyways, when I wake up at 5 a.m., I know that I'm the most like I'm no one else works harder than me type of a situation. And that's, that's not how we wanted to be.
We want to make sure that we are showing just enough of our true selves because again, and pod daddy Stephen Hacker had a really good point when we did our trials, our test episodes to make sure that we are not.
And I think we're not opening ourselves up too much that we still like have some boundaries. And I think we've done a pretty, pretty good job with that. I don't feel like I've ever gone too far into anything. I'm comfortable with the lines that I've made and where I'm at.
And I think it's, it's something special that we've been able to create a true community. And something that I mean, seems to be showcasing this, this whole that there is in the productivity space.
And I think we have a lot of our conductors is just how absolutely passionate they are about what we're doing and the community that we're building. And this energy of authenticity and not being afraid to be real and to be yourself is is so important to me.
And it's not only is what gives me like the energy to keep going because if we want, we want you, you, if you are listening to this. Hi, I love you. Hello, you. I want you to know that you are important. The work that you are doing is valued.
The things that you are providing to it is absolutely worthwhile. But more than that, you as a person are valuable in this space. The earth is not dependent on what you are providing to the world. Your worth is absolutely part of who you are.
You, even if you just wake up today and you're in bed and that is all you are doing, you are absolutely successful. You are being productive because you are still present in the space.
And we absolutely love you and adore you for that because it's important to remember that your worth as a human is not dependent on what you get done. Okay, we know everyone has a different journey that you're on. We're not all in the same storm.
We are sorry, we're not all in the same boat, but we are in the same storm. And we're here to try and help you know, give you a little bit of, of extra. I don't know where I'm going with this. Clearly, I'm so tired. Pass it, pass it. I'm here. I'm here. Pass it. Pass it. All right, ready, tank.
So going back to one thing and then we can move to the next question. Yes, the conduit trials, as we will call them. I mean, it was, it felt very much like an audio audio vlog type situation at the beginning. And honestly, I was like, you know, that's, that's cool.
I would still love to do something like that in the future, whatever, but this show became way more than that.
I mean, when I have to explain to people what conduit is like publicly, they're like, like how, like what is that look like? How does that feel?
And it's like, we've seen people publish books, not because of conduit, but with, with a little bit of help with a little bit of reminder and accountability.
We've seen people plan weddings. We've seen people buy houses, decorate, you know, pick up pets like it became the the life vlog of everyone else around us, the people listening. And like we got to be flies on the wall for all of those things, which is just incredible.
And I think, you know, when they say like what, what gives us the energy to keep going, it's, it's people checking in every single week. Like when you, when you don't see someone's check in or a connection check, like you're like, oh, I hope they're okay.
 Like there's no, there's no podcast that I have ever listened to that has that same feeling of like if, if there are people that disappear for a while, if there are people that come back after disappearing for a while, it's almost like, no, let's take a second and catch up and in here how it's been and what's going on and doing so many things like I, I was very hesitant on the idea of, you know, eventually our show would just become a whole like regular check in for people.
 But honestly, like that really is like the best part of just hearing how people are living life and hearing that people don't get it, you know, 100% of the time and they're okay with telling people that I think the world would be so much better if people just admitted when they didn't do things the right way or when they didn't know the answer and things like that, but we're we're we're so poised to either be a professional or capitalize off of other people's mistakes and not our own.
And this show has just consistently been the buck against that trend and I am here for it like every other week when we actually do the show.
And I love and again, you know, we always joke about the like, hey, become a member, we'll move to weekly or whatever, but like I think as long as we can keep the energy of what the show is now, I don't care how often we do it as long as we're doing it.
 Absolutely, and I want to make sure to that we're trying to lower the barrier of entry to become a conductor, not just like a super conductor like yes, great, we would love to, you know, have your money for me, but like more importantly, if you are listening to this and you're scared to submit a connection.
And I get it, that's okay, like you are still valid and we're here for you. I want to make sure that we're here to support you and that's why we do that's why we do the our connection check so that we can cheer you on and celebrate your wins with you because it's important.
I think a lot of our society doesn't take the time necessarily to support the wins. And we want to celebrate that with you. And so it's super easy to do, we still have the Twitter thing, but that's not the best.
If you want to go to feedback and submit your connections through feedback, you can go to relay.fm slash conduit slash feedback and that will go through the feedback. And so you don't necessarily have to be a member of anyone on relay FM switch on.
But we want to we want to make sure that you are comfortable with where you're at. So if you haven't submitted a connection before and you'd like to, we would love to hear from you. If it's been a while, absolutely take some time. We want we want to know how you're doing.
But even if you don't know what to do, it's okay to just to even have your connection be figure out my connection for next time. That's okay. And if you don't, if you don't pay us, that's okay because you'll just hear an ad. Yeah. That's fine. Yeah. Yes. Also the email conduit FM at gmail.
com does still exist and work and sometimes we even check it. Absolutely. I know. Thanks, Railsie. Is that for us? No, we probably should.
But right now it's just kind of like our cotton bureau supplies, which is a quick reminder of, hey, did you know we have merch? We have some we have shirts and sweatshirts and hoodies and that sort of thing. But we also have stickers.
We have a variety of different stickers that kind of lean into the inside jokes, but also you can proclaim your love of being a conductor. Some really great stickers out at. Oh my gosh. What is at you? You can wear it. You can wear it. Why oh you see when w e a r i t.
I just realized that that could be difficult to spell, but that's okay because we can spell some words. Anyways, this episode of conduit is brought to you by memberful in business if something isn't working as it should it can slow everything down, which ultimately affects profits.

At the end of every sponsor ad, I'd like to say thanks to someone out there listening in a different place in their language. And this time I pick randomly. We'll probably not do that again. I say that every time this time it is in Samoan, which is for Afitai. There we go. Thank you.
All right, you want to read our next question? Yeah. This question came from the never floundering fishie guy. How do you arrange your office to be more productive? If Jay is comfortable talking about it, what, how do I hope my new office will look and feel like? Okay.
Since I was asked, I can, I'll jump in first. So my current office wasn't specifically designed to be, quote, unquote, more productive. It was designed to be able to produce content in a way that was as easy as possible, which I guess is the definition of productivity in my case.
I have, or I had, because now everything is getting packed up, so many things that were mounted so that I could swing them in and out of position like my microphone is mounted on an Elgato low profile mic arm. So when I'm not using it, I can just kind of push it to the side and it's off the desk.
I had mounts for multiple cameras, so I could do multiple camera angles, including one from my phone with a MagSafe mount and one for my actual mirrorless camera. And then my webcam, so I could technically do like three different camera angles with any, with any video that I wanted to do.
 And then I just staged my background so that I looked fancy and that I didn't have to, I used to have a green screen while saw a green screen, but I used to have to pull down my green screen or I would have to set up my camera like on a tripod and then like be facing a different wall that was kind of like where I would present.
And I genuinely think that both of those solutions are valid. One of the things that we're actually talking about doing in our new place is one, my office is just my office currently I share my office with my spouse. So I will have my own office. It will just be my office.
And then there is a possibility that I will also have a private recording room that is basically only for recording audio. And it's not just a closet like it was for so many years for me. Like it'll be an actual space where I could probably do audio and video in there.
But that will allow me to have like a separation of concerns when I'm doing audio stuff I can go into my audio space. I'll have a dedicated machine that's just focused on recording.
And then when I say thing for video and then when I'm at my desk doing job job things, then I can go into my audio space. I can go into my hobby job things. Then I will have a much clearer desk with less things, a stone about.
And then I guess the only other thing I can add before I give it to Kathy is this past year I invested in a portable monitor such a good investment such a I can't even explain when you need a reference monitor. I can literally pick up and move and it's still like it's like 18 inches.
So it's definitely like it would be too big if it were a laptop, but it's definitely small enough that like if I'm if I just need to move over somewhere like right now I'm using it as my primary monitor because all of my other computer equipment is packed up.
And it's just so helpful whether you're on the go, whether you just need a second monitor to monitor chats and things like that would highly recommend they're like less than $100. And if you're an Apple user, they can usually support power over Thunderbolt.
So it's like a one cable solution such a good investment. Kathy, what about you? It's amazing. So I my right now my office is an absolute mess. And so it's not as productive of a space that I would like to be. However, I still make space for the things that I need.
So every week what am I clients comes in or they don't come in. I get in the mail from FedEx their mail to scan and file and name and and ship off to them to to be able to review and look at and that's where I think.
I have the scanner on my desk 24 7 and it lives right here so I can just flip it up. Flip it open and then automatically will already be connected. It's all set ready to go. I also have a label maker because I do shipping for clients. I used to take it out of the drawer every time that I needed it.
So it didn't fill in the things like it didn't I used to lay shipping out packages because it was so rough to like. Unload it from the drawer and I just was like. So it just stays connected or it doesn't actually stay connected to my computer, but it always stays plugged in.
So all I have to do is attach the USB A cable to my computer when I'm ready to do it. I don't have enough. I have a eight slot external USB port hub thing as well as all of the slots on the back of my iMac pro and are all full.
So I can't keep it locked in at all times it goes into where my headphones go right now because my headphones are a USB A plug to. But that being said, I try and keep the space to the right of my desk open for my bullet journal with my pen. So I have my to do list right there.
Other than that, you know, specific cables for charging. Pens available. I've got the little. Dongo thing for my. Camera. Card readers that sort of stuff. I try and keep things out and visible. So I see them. So I use them. But it also does make it more clitori.
So it's definitely not a magazine worthy desk, but that's okay because it's how I get things done. Or at least try to. I love it. What is something that you. What's a thing that you've been looking at for a while that would just take your. Your productivity over the top. If you're office.
I have been looking at a like a standing desk specifically one that I can have a treadmill underneath. I have a. My work situation with client, a particular client may be changing in the coming weeks. Which would require more. At the desk work situation. So it's possible that I might need to.
Look into and make a final decision for that sooner rather than later. But we'll see how that goes. I don't know. I have a lot of. Choosing decision making. I don't know. Who knows what will happen in the future. But. And then in the long term for future. I'm going to. I'm going to. To.
In our very small backyard. Build an ADU unit. For my desk. For my office, which would be a bigger than our nine by 11 space that I am currently in. And that would be great. And then I would have this bedroom. Back to allow Ryan to have a space that has a door to close, which would be nice.
So who knows what's going to happen in the future. Yeah. Absolutely. I am. I just want quiet. Like. Yes. I am. I've been looking at so many like professional soundproofing solutions. I think that's what I would do is I would. I would completely soundproof my office. Just so that it's.
I would have to do with the quality, controlled audio. And I wouldn't have to deal with with too much reverb or echo. I wouldn't have to deal with outside noises. Like the level just the amount of time I would say just not having to de reverb things.
But then also the level of anxiety that I would get. I would remove with just like not being being able to hear people walking through the hallway. Like if my daughter has something on in her room and I can hear it because the walls are thin.
Like, oh man, if I could just walk in and just be dead quiet. And then I know that the only thing people will hear is my voice, no echo, no anything else. Yeah. That would be pretty amazing. This episode of Condo It is brought to you by HelloFresh.

So we're going to say 10 key and just go go from there. If I got it right, let me know if I got it wrong. If you're going to be nice about it, let me know. All right.
So Jay, I know we texted about not let's just do a quickie for this one because we did talk about having three questions at the top of the show. Sure. What is what is the called where you do it fast lightning, lightning round lightning round from Rosemary that yeah.
Give me one go to snack activity and show for when you're exhausted. Do I even have to say it? Is it Mario Kart? No, it's Tetris. It's absolutely it's 100% Tetris and I almost got a Tetris tattoo this past week. And I didn't and I didn't so really quick quick story.
I sat there and I had one idea and then I was like, you know, but I'm kind of flexible on the idea. So let's just play around with it a little bit. So literally on an iPad, the artists and I had each of the Tetris pieces. And we were sitting there trying to put them together.
It'll wave that would be fun and cool looking for a tattoo. So we were literally sitting there basically playing Tetris. We did that for an hour. And then afterwards we were like, yeah, we're closing. And I was like, oh, my bad. Maybe I'll come back. So I don't know. Oh, my gosh.
We never figured out what Tetris idea I'm going to get. I'm probably going to get something. Just don't know what yet. So yeah, I'm very excited. Well, and this next week I'm getting a unicorn tattoo and I'm very excited. Oh, man. We still haven't seen anyone get those conduit tattoos.
Like, yeah, I know. Come on. Show us your conduit tattoos. I almost got the conduit logo, but I got really worried about all the intricate line work. And I was like, yeah, it's a pretty complex. You need a very, very good street line drawer. Or maybe I'll just get a tire. Oh, there you go.
If you know, you know, if you know, then you know. So my go to activity usually is like cross stitch. If I really need to zone out or I will read a book. I read a lot of trashy romance, which is not trash. It's delightful smut, but it's easy to read.
And it's like low energy doesn't take a whole lot to go into it, which is really nice. And then my go to snack is gummy bears. I have a big bag in my drawer that always lives there. I like to open it up and leave it open.
So like they get stale and then they get extra extra chewy and it's really nice. And my show I will just like pick whatever I'm currently binging right now. I'm binging suits for the first time.
And then when it's over, I'm going to rewatch the good place because I haven't seen it again in a very long time. And a friend was just watching it for the first time. And I was so excited. I had forgotten such it's such a good show. It's such a good show. So good. And then of course chocolate.
I don't know. James, do I have any chocolate? Okay, listen, we're going to. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm in Portland. Here we go. I'm sorry, but I have to put this story out for the world to see whether or not I was in the right. And if James was a terrible human being, look what you started James.
You brought this up. This is your fault. So James very kindly smuggled chocolate from Scotland for a variety of the American North American listeners, fans, friends, buddies, etc. One of which is a crunchy, which is the heavenly honeycomb wrapped in chocolate candy bar.
It is the best invention ever. He brought a whole box full of it and says, Kathy, you can have as many as you want. And I was like, I know that these are not just for me. So you give me what I can have, how many want to give me. And I will be so thankful for it.
So I go into my room at one point and he wrote out hi, Kathy in all of the crunchies. Now I obviously needed to sleep.
So I put them in a back little did I know that sometime in the next day or so, he would enlist a dear friend of the show, Tiff to pull some of those crunchies out of my bag to deliver to other people.
Now, if he had like not told me, I wouldn't have known because I wouldn't have known like I didn't count them. This was just the number of chocolate bars that I had.
However, he chose to tell me that he went into my room or no, he enlisted someone else to go into my room to steal them and tell me this. Now, once again, if you had asked, absolutely, sure, yes, I miss gay, I gave you too many. Kathy, may I have some back? Yes. Here you go, James.
You may have these back to share with other people. But no, he was sneaky and then admitted it over lunch. And in the chat right now, James says, I was away. Yes, but guess what? A, we have plenty of text communications that you could have sent to text.
Number two, you could have waited to do that because it's not a chocolate emergency. Anyways, A, I, T, A, yes, the answer is yes. James is the A, the donkey butt, right? I just, I just want to point out why in a land full of apparently pandas and honeycomb chocolate is calling known for haggis.
Because of the number of sheep. I thought it was going to be something about butts, but you know, I mean, maybe I don't know. I don't know, but that being said, let's move on. I do have chocolate.
I will eat chocolate and I will eat it with the rage of the Scottish panda sprinkling and leaving the salt on.
Anyway, J, what is your connection? If everything goes right, and I mean everything, and I don't know if everything will go right, but if it goes right by the next conduit, I will have moved across the country. There is no other important task than to make sure that everything goes right.
And there are even some things that are beyond my control, but I want to at least be able to say that I want, I did everything in my power to make things go the right way. So that is my connection to do everything in my power to make sure things go the right way. I have been given a pass from work.
I am 100% focused on making this a successful move across the country. I will be on a plane this week or this weekend with a feline and a child and another human being, all of them probably crying for different reasons because they all hate confinement and planes.
I need this to be over so I can go back to being in my jovial self because I am stressed beyond all reason. Yeah, I'm going to have put your connection. I'm going to reword it a little bit and it's going to be just move across the country. Just move across the country.
That's going to be your connection because really that's the most important thing right now is is to move and then you can have a big green check mark because you will have moved because everything's going to be fine. Oh, I get. My connection.
I am going to put that I am going to recover from the month of July. I have not spent a weekend home since June. Which is a very long time and I have a single podcast scheduled on Saturday and other than that, I have nothing planned for this weekend and I would like to keep it that way.
And so I'm going to put recover as my connection because I need to get more sleep. I need to do less screaming because I have saying along to a lot of songs at the at the at the high level of volume.
And if I concentrate on recovering, then I can concentrate on the other work that needs to happen and needs to get done and I can become more productive at the times that I am awake. Let the record show this is not the first time Kathy has done this connection and that's okay. But the last time.
I'm not able to accomplish this. So I want everyone to have their shame quotes ready. If Kathy starts scheduling things for herself. So wow. I'm just ready. I'm ready to come in here and shame. Yeah. Oh, yeah. That's okay. Well, if you don't get your connection.
If I don't give my connection, there's a lot of big problems. I know. I know. That's why I'm ready. I'm ready to give you shame. Shame. All right. Our soprano of the show Debo's next connection, arranged for table and chair rentals and catering for a choir party. I'm hosting in August.
Oh, man, dealing with rental companies. Good luck. And the low down dirty mountain dweller of the show. Low gang says, uh, New Next Connection tidy up and decorate the new home office. Love it. Oracle of the show. So says next connection, keeping it going 15 minutes of writing every work day.
And try to enjoy it. I love this. Yes. Momentum. Scotland's own panda of the show. James says, now I need to actually do all the work. Maybe not all of it in the next two weeks.
But as soon as my jet lag wears off, I need to get back into the office and make a start on all the stuff that's been piling up while I've been selfishly enjoying myself. Self care is not selfish. Yes. But not today. Absolutely. You can do it. James.
Our Canadian trivia card enthusiast of the show Erica says New Connection, make it to her scary neurologist appointment and advocate for herself. She has to go to the swan alone. So she needs to make a list of questions and concerns and press for more than just a wait and see approach.
Her neurologist is great, but Alberta's healthcare system is overwhelmed. Understandable. Listen, Erica, you can do it. The scary, the scary neurologist is like, that's like a child story. It's the scary neurologist. The name list of the show says in similar theme to my work theme, work time.
I want to limit screen time in my personal life. Not because it's evil, but because I find myself spending my personal time on my phone screen instead of my gaming screen.
I have been buying video games in the last few months that I haven't played because I keep opting for the quick dopamine hit on Instagram or YouTube instead of setting up the racing wheel and playing Formula One.
The thing that everybody apparently loves these days or grabbing the switch to play that game with the link and stuff. I want to enjoy playing games without sacrificing the time I have for myself and my wife. I like it.
And finally, our train enthusiasts have the show a new connection in some major personal news. I'm moving to my first ever own house. To the lovely apartment. I'm renting. I'm hopefully getting the keys for the place at the end of the month.
So my connection is to get those keys and look around the place again to find what's there and what's not bonus connection. Start the moving process. It's an exciting time. Me too. Heck. Yeah. Everyone's moving. Everyone is calling your stuff. I don't know. Yeah.
