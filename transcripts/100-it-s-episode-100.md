From Relay FM, you're listening to Conduette. The show where we conduit our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduette, the show that starts off well and Kathy. And finishing at some point. The episode is brought to you by Micro.Blog and Vitaly.
I'm Jay for the 100th time and also for the 100th time. I'm Kathy, but technically it's only the 50th time. Since we've each done about half. I'm sure there are somebody out there that could tell us because of all of the individual episodes we did.
We might have done opposite numbers, but you know what? It doesn't matter. We've been here for 100 episodes in our heart. And that's what matters. Yeah, that's it's wild to think that I was like typing in thoughts. And I was like, this is the second show that I've done 100 episodes of.
And honestly, it still feels like the first time I've committed to something that long. Don't tell Brittany who I've been married to for over a decade. Oh, you know I'm going to tell you. I think you hear me. Hello, right here. Probably. This is also the second episode.
The second show that I've had 100 episodes of. But the last one was friends in your ears. And I ended it after 100 episodes. It was the greatest show ever. I miss it in my feed, but also understand the how challenging it is to do a show like that. So yeah.
So safe to say this isn't either one of ours first radios, but somehow it still feels super, super special. Also, can we talk about the implication of it's not my first rodeo, but suddenly at your second rodeo, you are able to do the things that you weren't able to do it for. Yeah. Yeah.
But that seems like a really over-convitation that suddenly at your second rodeo, you know, how to do it all. That seems weird. Yeah. Well, we've got a jam packed show with a lot of different things, just different things across the board to celebrate 100. Very different.
But let's get through some of the things that we always do like Kathy, what happened this week in the discord? Yeah.
This week was a lot of fun mainly because we all, well, first off, for those of you that maybe don't know, my curly came back from maternity leave from paternity leave and jumped right in so much fun to hear him on shows and see him in the discord.
But also we had a really fun moment of the newsletter for Relay came out and there was a little bit of a typo where Stephen Hackett put that he was joined in Memphis at the St.
 Jude Play Live Summit by Casey List, and then he was named by myself Jason Stnell and Bard Dowdy, which then did a long running joke of basically Bard Dowdy implies the existence of Barbarian Dowdy, Rogue Dowdy, Artificer Dowdy and Clarek Dowdy, and then we also got identified with a variety of other D&D, like whose, which D&D character is each of us and that was really fun.
What D&D character are you? Apparently it's a little bit between a fighter and Barbarian is what the group has decided. I was feeling Dragonborn, but like, you know that. Well, Dragonborn is the race, not the class. A teaf of some sort, a tiefling. A tiefling? A tiefling? Still race versus.
Okay, see this is why I stopped playing games like that. Anyway, we also had a co-working session where our super conductor friends discussed the plan for this whole episode, as well as like taxes and how painful they are, even though they shouldn't be, even though they still are for some reason.
The Wheel of Time TV show on Prime Video, if you want to learn more about that, check out Kathy's amazing websites, podcasts, video series, Kathy plugged the stuff. Yeah, so I am also CEO of DragonMount, which is the oldest Wheel of Time based community on the internet.
And with season three, having just come out, we had a lot to talk about. We got to talk about it in the super conductor chat, which was also fun. Yep, and I was trying to find my way to my hotel in Chicago, which was fun and slightly in an adventure, but nothing too bad.
So yeah, if you want to hang out with us in the discord, or especially hang out with us in our super awesome co-working session, then go to I'm a super conductor dot com. That's letter I letter M letter A super conductor dot com and become a member today.
Folks, this is the 100th episode, something that I forgot who did this before, but I believe it was perhaps our good friends, Bard Dowdy, and Mike Hurley, who did this on their pin addict podcast that was basically like, this is going to be the primer episode. This is the repriming of conduit.
So for folks who are listening, you know, on your regularly scheduled Thursday, when this comes out, then awesome. It should be like any other show except maybe a little bit more explanatory.
And then for folks who are listening and wondering like, hey, do I need to go back and listen to all 100 episodes of conduit to get a feel for what conduit is. No, just go listen to episode 100, and then maybe an episode 200 will do it again. Who knows.
Who knows? And who knows what the show will look like in four years. Oh, it definitely doesn't look like it did on episode zero. No, definitely not. The first six months of episode zero is oh my goodness. So many. We got to talk about that. Yes, yes, for sure.
But before we do that, I'm going to move the shout out to later because I think they're going to go well with other stuff. Let's get right into our connection checks. Zapp, zapp, zapp, zapp. Oh, that was like the best. That's happened a while.
So, hey, our friendly editor, can you find the marvelous mirror of zapps audio file that Kathy had and throw that in there right about now, unless you couldn't find it. And then that's okay. Kathy, how did you do? It has been a pretty intense last couple of weeks. I did not.
So my connection was to try and do journaling. I did not do any of it. I did not even pick up my notebook. However, spoiler alert for the next connection, since I'm not traveling. So the entire month of April, I have been home like 18 days, maybe tops.
And so I will be home for at least the next two weeks. And that is that is a better time to attempt journaling. So spoiler alert for my next connection. Yeah, I would think that that's probably a better time to do those things to be honest.
Oh, before we do that, first of all, what are connection checks? Oh, yeah, what a great idea. Connection checks are, so this is an accountability podcast. First and foremost, this is an accountability podcast.
We take a lot of time and effort into just checking in with each other and figuring out like, what are the important things in life that we're trying to get done? Sometimes it could be as hectic as writing a book or getting married or buying a house or moving house or doing these other things.
Sometimes it's just a matter of like journaling or taking a break or catching a breath or going to sleep. Making an appointment that you've been trying to that you know that you've needed to make for a long time. Yep, that you've been putting off for months.
This show is all about like people being the best possible version of they can be at that, at that like particular time. And that also just means that if you didn't get anything else done in a two-week span that maybe you got that one thing done.
But of course it's okay if you didn't as well like that's fine too. Other things happen. Life happens.
This is meant for you to have accountability, but it's also meant to be kind of reassuring that even if the thing didn't happen, it's not the end of the world and that there's always the next two weeks maybe to try and get it done. Yeah, because we're here to support you. Real life is difficult.
It's next to impossible to ever be perfect with anything that you do. And it is unfortunate that there is a lot of the world out there that implies a level of if you're not perfect, why try or oh here is this these three magic steps make you the most productive person in the world.
Or something similar and I think it's important to be able to say you know what I'm okay. I'm okay having survived here. I'm okay. Sometimes getting through the day is the biggest goal and we're proud of you. And thank you for being here and we're so happy that you exist in the world.
So with that being said, my connection check was to give the best version of the talk that I could give. And I could wax poetic about like trying to re implement slides and removing a bunch of stuff and then like completely flipping the idea of the talk on its head.
But I will save you all of that and just say that like I genuinely think that I presented the talk like the best possible version of that talk that I could present with the caveat of I don't think that I did the best job presenting it if that makes sense.
Like I gave the best version of the talk, but I didn't I didn't do the best job giving the best version of the talk, but I still think I did a really good job, especially given the busyness of this season and everything else and all the things happening.
So I'm going to give myself a pat on the back a thumbs up and I gave myself a green check mark for that. And now for those who are listening for the first time, we not only hold ourselves accountable, but we also hold our community accountable.
So without further ado, here are the connections for our conductors and I have to put like these side by side so I can push buttons and find things.
 Let's start with our also our conductors have super awesome nicknames we give them nicknames you can get a nickname to you just have to submit a connection and then tell us what you want your nickname to be so with that all the way our profane sleeper of the show Mike says red stop sign I did in fact get distracted from saving for my trip and I bought an intendo switch to as a result of the distraction so that's okay.
 I mean yeah sounds sounds to me like the switch is going to be useful on your trip exactly and also jealous because I signed up through Nintendo to get put on the waiting list which means that I have yet to be emailed about about no anything so we shall see oops our checklist enthusiasts of the show Mike says previous connection green check mark prepare for our family trip for my daughter's fifth birthday and he is currently on said trip so that right there success well done.
 And now we have a special message the of the show says connection check green tree I spent lots of time enjoying the lovely weather these past couple weeks some extra long dog walks working on my laptop in the backyard and going to knocking for my local political candidate I opened all the windows and they have stewed let all the fresh air and that's so awesome.
Ah who now I know who is and I forgot so we're just going to ignore all of that and go oh thank you. Awesome. That's okay.
All right our Oracle of the show so says green apple connection check I had a whole long weekend off for the Easter break and it was glorious I think I'll try doing this day off Marlarky more often also if you don't if for those who are listening for the first time.
We play these parts where Kathy is like the reassuring human being that is ever so loving to our community and I'm the person that hates everything and I love that but also you're going to your grumble grumble grumble about it.
Yes yes and for the record I'm not playing with this carrying supportive thing either I do in fact care for all y'all and I do in fact hate everything our brother of the show Devos says connection check green heart I made it through the marathon of Easter singing way to go Devo.
 Our chief swifty of the show Andrew says connection check yellow heart I didn't get much time in on sketch up because I was needed in other areas and this is this is also another part of the show is that this this acknowledgement and recognition that it is okay to have not gotten something done that happens that's realistic that is life and it's okay to be held accountable for that.
I just want to throw out third in Canada you can't download sketch up you have to download scats up. Boo moving on our fish bear of the show fishy guy says green check whatever my previous connection was I totally hasted okay so yes sometimes I'm not going to do that.
Sometimes we're just winning in life and we know we just know that we did all the things even if we don't remember what that thing was. Goodness robot extension here of the show eight and says green lettuce I think that's romaine a date was set for my friends to go out to dinner her.
Man there's something special about setting up like scheduling stuff with your friends that's how you know you're your old but I try and do. I have a sushi date with a friend once a month and I have brunch date with two friends once a month and when we we scheduled the next one before we.
I think that's the only thing that I can do is I can't believe the event that we're on because otherwise we forget and so I highly recommend that that is yes I haven't hung out with a lot of friends because we've not made plans.
 Canadian trivia card enthusiast of the show Erica has said not one but two red X's I did neither clean my makeup brushes nor my dish water dish washer filter cleaning your dish water is probably important but your dish washer filter I have no excuse I just didn't do it you know sometimes it be like that.
Indeed indeed and I believe we have an audio for this next one. Yes our.
I have to make sure I got the right one connection check name was of the show green circle I was able to survive this last fortnight it was pretty hectic I had two big events including Easter service but everything went off without a hitch which was great.
 I was also able to be a part of all the planning and all the meetings I need needed to be a part of so hopefully next few months don't feel as hectic as this last fortnight did along with that was able to send in all the applications I wanted to including to some jobs that were really interesting so hopefully I get an interview.
That's awesome yay so much so much happening across all the things also nameless mentioned that they did not say zap but that's okay we said zap for you so is that yes zap and then all right.
We have a few more tech podcast listener of the show pillics says we'll try not to forget to record my connection tonight let's see connection was not recorded.
I'm sorry connection check green book taxes have been paid and alternate paperwork has been filed that's okay nameless not nameless well nameless but also pillics pillics also often listens in live and has let us know that.
 There are more important things that took precedent then the whole recording of the things indeed yeah indeed we have some other ones shall we hear them yes let's okay let's see this one comes from I see I don't have people's of the show so I'm just going to have to hope that is it yeah hope that they say if not I can probably fill it in.
Okay perfect awesome well here's the next one. First off the bat I want to wish Jay and Kathy and all the great shows are happy 100 congratulations on this great achievement so let's get to it connection check I was going to write my resume.
Yellow paperwork didn't get the resume finished that did a lot of prep work and a lot of thinking and a lot of note taking in my knowledge management system but I need to get the resume written. Okay that was from Carl.
Okay so Carl of all trades of the show Carl of all trades of the show so I should have I should have known that I didn't know that that's okay I knew it okay and then the next one we have is from a a run. I think is our identical twin of the show that is correct correctly.
Yep this is Aaron the identical twin of the show connection check green circle I booked a few days off next month and we'll be using that time to go visit family. I'm hoping to see them some friends and maybe get around a golfing with my brother awesome that that just sounds really fun.
 And is I'm going to assume that the brother that you are going to do a golf round with is the other identical twin of the show which is hilarious in my brain I'm just imagining that you guys are both either wearing the exact same outfits or opposite like a navy top and khaki shorts and then a short like a khaki shirt and navy paint like shorts.
And just really messing with everyone because I think that would be really entertaining but that's just how my brain goes and I apologize if that's offensive because I'm sorry because I did a cool twins I have to just do nothing yeah swap yep.

 So Kathy who's who's ideal was conduit way back when it was your idea sir I forgot yeah yes you were on the show you know what we're going to call it Twitter uh it was and it's the only appropriate use of dead naming and also that it existed um you made a post about discussing gosh I wish I had thought to find it.
You can because I deleted my well I feel but I'm pretty sure I had a screenshot somewhere um for this very reason uh basically we had met through mutual friends.
I think Matthew Castanelli is how we met and we had multiple chats and conversations and follow each other on Twitter and in my feed I remember seeing a post something about like man I wish I could do a show about productivity but like real not a hyper productivity group.
Show with with stuff but like reality and the funniest part is is I had I saw that tweet after literally having a conversation with somebody about a bunch of the like books.
Specifically and pretty sure deep work was the one that really really got me angry in in in the discord in fact and it was the fact that it was like.
Here's this idea of here's a productivity book that's all about you know here's how you are able to find time to concentrate on and just like sit down and do your things in the answer is you have other people do everything else and take care of your like take care of it for you.
You can do you know four hours of deep work if you have a spouse or a nanny that can take care of the kids and you know people that are cleaning the house people that are cooking meals etc.
of hanging the bills doing grocery shopping all of these other things that allows you to like stop thinking about them and just do. What it is that you need to do.
 I remember discussing the fact that I could not get through this book it made me just like violently angry because it's it is there is nothing wrong with having nannies having support having people that can help you out hiring people to you know clean your house or you know doing these things in order to have a more.
Successful or happy life the problem is is when you are writing a book saying hey in order to be successful you need to be able to sit and just do the things.
And not acknowledging the privilege or the fact that somebody else is doing this work for you and so the timing was perfect because I had this in my mind where I was like look I am not a white male. I can't speak for anyone else other than myself.
I know that I am not a white male and I know that my life is structurally different than a lot of others.
I know that the caregiving that I do for both my teenager and my spouse is is there the businesses that I run that things will fall through the cracks and I do have help and support but I'm still that main person.
It's it's next to impossible for me to be truly concentrating on everything that's going on because there are so many things that are that are that have to happen.
I need to manage and in order to be successful and in order to be productive I need to do things a little bit differently than you know productivity gurus.
Yeah, I it's weird because at one point I like I had you know I was regular friends with with people who were these like productivity gurus who were like having people pay to come in and like make them more productive and like not like what Kathy does Kathy actually does like work as a thing.
These folks like I mean they do work but they do work on like their stuff and they basically just tell the other person to like try like micro scheduling and you know eating the frog first thing in the morning because that's what we all need to think about is like eating frog legs at like 8 a.m.
 which again I'm not going to complain about where I grew up that's fine but you know that's that's not that's not the trick and really that's at one point I was all about finding the tricks and that was you know kind of my little how I became into productivity or whatever story was I needed a trick at that point I was like drowning in work and things like that and needed a trick.
But quickly what I realized was that there wasn't like there wasn't like a list of tricks that everyone could do that would solve problems and instead what you know even in my older show I learned relatively quickly that the thing that made people feel productive or made people feel.
 You know capable was understanding just three simple words I got this like it was it was like that simple of even when it feels like I don't have it it's like I know what my life looks like I know what I'm capable of doing I know what I'm not capable of doing it I know what stresses are there and if I give if I give myself the time in the space to really process it.
I can even learn like what things can I just dump and we forget that because in life you're not thinking about that in life you're thinking about like I got to find a job or I've got to get my taxes done or I've got to you know pay this bill and I don't know how I'm going to do that.
So like for me the show the show like as it was and then how it became to be kind of now was more of just that reminder of like look you got two people with extremely hectic lives extremely hectic schedules were responsible for other smaller humans.
 We have so many other things going on in our world and yet I've talked to Kathy so many times about just being like everything in my life is absolute is an absolute tragedy like making time for conduit is the thing that's keeping me going from like every other week to every other week is like I can't wait to talk about these frustrations with Kathy on Tuesday and Tuesday's when we record Thursday's when the show comes out.
Yeah.
 Yeah and I think you know part of part of what I love about this show is the community aspect because this is not just about us this is about you all and that's what that is the biggest difference between this show that we are doing now and the one that we originally thought of and I think that's really really special the relay discord had been out for like a year.
And we had deeply built this community already of people that were looking for connection that we're looking for a team to support and work together and because of that I think that gave us.
The hint and tip and idea of to bring this accountability aspect into the show and I think it's something that makes this so special and part of that is because in my brain.
 I am working through being okay with being selfish to the point where I can set up boundaries I can say no to things I can say yes to things etc but the idea of doing a show where all I'm doing is talking to Jay while fantastic and I love that it wasn't tickling the brain in a way that I really like felt passionate about.
And with these bits by having people submit their connections and their connection checks and this idea that hey we want to check in on you.
 Even if you are not even if you have never submitted a connection before and I know that there are a lot of you out there that are maybe listening to our voices and haven't done so that is 100% okay you are not required to do this and we still care and love and appreciate you and hope the best for you.
And learning that it's being okay with discussing the fact that it's okay if something fails this week that worked last week or the fortnight in the future in the fortnight in the past. Nameless called it squishy productivity in the chat right now and that is so real.
Things have to constantly change it's why we do our quarterly systems checks because things will adjust based on where you're at in your life what you're doing it nothing will remain stagnant and that is just kind of the reality of life.
 And I love the fact that we get to talk about that I love the fact that every fortnight I get a sit with my buddy Jay and other friends and conductors and and be okay discussing the sad things but also the happy things and how we're getting through it this acknowledgement that I don't know if you know this but life is hard.
It can be really difficult sometimes to just get through the day and I am so glad that you are getting through the day.
 I think that there's like the the two sides of the coin there there is the like we can be serious and be not so serious like at the same time which is so wonderful we're like us carrying like I mentioned like Kathy and I I don't want to say that we play parts because I don't I don't think it was a very intentionally like designed to play a part I think there are just some things that Kathy and I are so like different on like I'm a big sports person Kathy cannot be bothered.
You don't read I do like I don't read like that is a thing I wrote the notes guess who didn't read the notes.
 Yeah so like I am an avid Disney like non-apologist or critic I guess and everyone else on the planet wishes that they were born in like anaheim or something I don't know but like there are there are a lot of these things that we do that are kind of in a way just really it's meant to be fun it's meant to be like I'm a very hard it's meant to to have like a small reprieve in a world of like where everyone feels like every decision is like so important but at the end of the day like really you can you can just be your fun self you can just do your fun things and still wind up just having community that might might pick at you from time to time but still just be there for you and be supportive and like Kathy one of the things that I really wanted to ask was like early on in the shows like development process like this show is so different than what it was supposed to be at episode zero which is which is fine I think about the one piece of advice that we got from the Beards and the Beards are the the owners of relay which are Mike and Steven and the the advice that we got from Steven is just like don't don't be too personal or don't don't get too personal about it in like in some way like in the shape of form like try to have try not to let your life be narrated by the show but like there I feel like this type of show that's just not possible like I think there are definitely barriers that we put up that are just like we're not going to talk about certain parts of our lives like on the show but I look back I have changed jobs twice since the show has started I have I have started nonprofits I have advanced in my career significantly I have watched my child go from someone who like kicks button karate to someone who you know has stopped doing the thing that like I was most excited about on a weekly basis and I have watched like so many milestones not just in my life but other people's lives happen through this show Kathy can you talk about some of the things that have stood out for you just over the years as we've done conduit just from like a personal or an observation you know standpoint I'm a lot of it kind of is you all have helped me learn a little bit more about like how my brain works my ADHD and my anxiety and how to shape my days to be their best and also really helping give kind of some structure to saying no to things I gotta use that tire yeah gotta use the tire method baby and to anyone that this is you know their first show or whatever one of the things that came out of one of the first episodes I think was like episode five or six or something came out of nowhere and it's called the tire method nine oh my goodness episode nine that was a long time ago still one of my favorite episodes it kind of came out of no we were trying to discuss how to say no to things or how to choose what to say and so we created the tire method which is an acronym that stands for time intuition resources and energy trying to figure out how to make choices and decisions that can best support what is going on in your life and being able to to say do I have time for this thing what does my intuition say is my like initial reaction maybe not or is it hell yeah intuition is a huge marker that there isn't a lot of of acceptance and acknowledge that that is a good thing resources do I have financial resources for this do I have the the pieces and the and the products needed for something and then lastly do I have the energy energy ebbs and flows and if you are not renewing your energy in a way that is even marginally successful it can be difficult to add more things it can be really difficult to to have the energy to be able to do the best version of what is being asked of you and and this idea that life is going to give you opportunities you don't have to say yes to all of them is is is is important and for the record I'm terrible at doing this myself do what I say not what I do anytime I talk to new people or introduce myself and they're like what do you do and it's like well what a great question and a lot of times I don't even bring up a variety I do so much and my answer is always tailored to the audience that I'm talking to because if I'm sitting and I'm telling you everything that is going on in my life it's enough for like three people which is why some of the things I'm not doing really successfully and that's okay because I'm working on how to move my own brain adjustments but also it's okay to also say yes to the things because you really really love them I also think that there's like there's a world where like having permission to do the thing that you either know you should do or do the thing that you ultimately are like I shouldn't care like I should have permission to not care like this made me think of two specific instances in the show one was recently when we had a wonderful guest in Merlin man introduce himself as a writer who does podcasts and like in my mind I was just like no you're like a podcaster that writes at this point like I've I've always known Merlin as the podcaster and I think that you know save this for another episode I've recently had these questions and there's like questions around like personal identity and things like that where everyone around you has some opinion of who you are and they put their expectations on you based on their perception of who you are where you can have complete ability to subvert that and be okay with subverting that and I think that the one of the things that made me smile laugh, giggle, do all the things was Kathy do you remember our first negative review?
Remind me of it because I am vaguely remembering but now I want to kind of look it up.
Our first negative review that we got was that we were too silly and not serious enough. Oh, and didn't we didn't there was another one hold on now I got it hold on.
Then there was the clap back review where we had people come back and just be like I love the show for insiliness and I love that they don't take themselves so seriously.
Yes, let's allow me to read this lead by example please deliver information in a concise and precise and efficient manner listening to the silly banter is the most unproductive and frustrating portion of my day.
That is okay because guess what that is that is we are not for everybody and there is nothing wrong with that I am so happy to not be to be to be the people that we are. And thank you for being along the line the road.
 I just wonder like that person has to like wake up to like the first sound of their so this is how they've evolved that I know who that was that was the person who's been super popular lately on TikTok for like waking up in the morning getting the bottle of syrup and water or like oh my gosh yeah yeah all right here's my 4 a.
m. wake up I wake up I have my you know filtered water that has been chilled to a specific like percentage degrees and then I'm going to put it in a nice water and then I'm going to take like a ice bath and only then can I tell myself that I'm awake and anyone else that doesn't do this is wrong.
I give myself three messages of encouragement and then keep it moving it is so funny because it's just like what in Saratoga water is actually really good so like trinket don't don't waste it like this idiot is doing like it's just good water but.
 If if you come to this show looking for a solution and the solution isn't like take a deep breath relax like if you sincerely have like a I have this problem and I need I got five minutes to get it solved one you probably shouldn't be listening to podcasts you should just be doing the thing that you need to do but then like also.
If there is if you're in a position that is like. I I just can't I can't have fun I can't relax I can't just not take everything so seriously then like I just feel sad like I feel sad for you at that point because I I have been there I think I think a lot of us have been there at that point.
And what I would say is it's better on the other side being being able to go you know what I'm going to have a dance break which is one of Kathy's like earliest connections of just like alarm goes off got a dance like just committing to doing random tick talks.
Just being silly just not taking yourself so seriously I would hate to say that we've we've solved productivity but I genuinely do feel like anytime I'm struggling with something the second I go.
Let me take the seriousness of this thing down like one level even just one level and take a deep breath give myself a laugh about it and then like all right let's get back to work and I go into it.
I have a little clear mind I have a little bit of clarity on the topic you know I'm just going to get up and take a nap on this and then come back and like be ready to solve it like.
There are so many things that just come with not being so dang serious all the time that yeah like again I just feel bad for you if you're not capable of doing that yeah it's it's it's sat you know it.
And this is happening in the live stream chat which is one of the benefits of being a member of relay you don't have to be a super conductor to join us for the live show.
But so says that they want to say everyone can fit in the conduit community but maybe there are people who just won't quite get it which is valid but I think it's more of I mean the comment there are people that aren't ready for us and that is okay like we are.
We are not for everybody and again totally fine with that because the people that we are here for are the ones that are extremely passionate and haven't been able to find a place where they are welcomed and we are so happy that they are here.
Yeah so Kathy do you have any thoughts on the next hundred episodes.
I mean ideally I'd love to you know become a better person myself be a better Kathy just be a better Kathy I I know that there's a lot of health things that I need to work through that are affecting my day to day life and I want to keep doing my best sometimes I'm not going to be a better Kathy.
That and this idea that the best changes the best is going to my best today is going to be different than my best tomorrow we are home at like 11 30 from a weekend where I got less than four hours to sleep most every night. My best is real basic it's going to be very low bar for today.
But I'm after we're done recording I'm giving myself permission to take a nap to hopefully recover and be finished out the day a little bit stronger.
I am also going to be now that I'm not you know traveling for a while I'm going to be resetting kind of my local like you know physical space a little bit and I think that's going to.
Kind of set the foundation the these next few years it's going to be a rough couple years for a variety of reasons especially being a non white male.
And this is not a political podcast this is not a social justice podcast this is a this is the reality that we live in and it would be silly to not acknowledge it. And so they are going to be a lot of days where it's like am I hanging in there am I still around.
But also am I finding my people am I able to keep my community as safe and supported and happy as possible. I sure hope so that is that is my goal that is my that is my purpose I was told this weekend that my presence. And so I really felt somebody feel like a warm hug was a person.
And that I am like a human Xanax and I am taking that really to heart and I really want to keep that up. I don't know about the human Xanax just a calm, you know central vibing space. I think it's been interesting.
And I don't wanna say getting older, because I mean, it's been, I mean, Kathy, if I tell you, it's been almost half a decade of doing condo with like that. Root. I know, right? Root. But I will say, by episode 200, we'll be several, several, several years into doing the show.
And I look forward to seeing where I am with that. I mean, again, so much has happened, just in the time of doing this show. And I, you know, I'm looking at like, okay, my kid will be like well into school, learning different things, having different likes, dislikes, all this other stuff.
I will have probably changed a lot of what I like and don't like in things. And as I start to unpack that, it makes me like very excited, but also, I don't know what the word is.
Like, I don't want to say trepidatious, but like Kathy, it's been so long since the old show that I did was like a fun thing. And that's always the fear is that like we get complacent in doing like the same thing over and over.
But also, I'm so excited because I feel like even though there have been topics that we've covered more than once, I feel like there's never been a show that didn't need to happen.
Yeah, yeah, I know the Memphis beard comment about, you know, not being too personal, it makes sense and it's completely valid, but also our lives affect what's happening. Like what is going on in our life really impacts our productivity and what we're able to get done and all of that.
And I think it's interesting to see and hopefully we can keep doing the things that we need to do in order to keep being the people that we are. Or become the people that we need to become in that time. Yes, yes, exactly. I'm like super excited for it.
Well, before we get sappy and all we've got to do is get the opportunity to do it. I'm like super excited for it. Well, before we get sappy and all we've got to eat. No, I'm not crying, you're crying. Let's think our next sponsor, this episode of Conduette is brought to you.

OK, so now time for the shout outs. I'm sure we have a couple of shout outs that are going to be relevant to our last week's episode. Yes. So we have one from our Identicalsman of the show, Aaron, who said episode 99 was such a great example of why I like being a super conductor.
The pre-show led into the discussion around preparing a talk, organizing one schedule, and traveling, and then just out of the overall feelings and vibe of the episode. The post show was well wrapping up those stories by talking about first-class travel. Love the show and keep it up.
Kathy, how would you like to know that I'm going to be head to Pittsburgh soon and I'm doing it in class? Yeah. It's a little bit too much. I flew from Atlanta and it was a classy economy, baby.
Yeah, so there is the, it was funny because early in the conversation, you mentioned like all the things that are like, oh, you want to be productive, have a nanny, and do all this other stuff. And I'm like, look, my kid grew up with a nanny.
Like, I've had people doing all of my yard work and I'm still jacked up. Like that. Right. Yeah, but see, here's the thing is that it's not, you're not saying, oh, I'm amazingly productive and not mentioning these people that are taking care of important things in your life. Not quite the opposite.
If you looked at my house, like. Oh, it's a mess right now. It looks like someone just went off and just threw everything all over the place. And then we have another message.
And this one, I think it's going to start the other shout outs that we have, which is from the awe of the show, aw, that says, I'm out of the house today without my laptop, so I can't do it, but know that it's in spirit. I wanted to stitch the go-d scream in the Wilhelm scream for the show.
Well, you did do it. Anyway, happy 100. If we haven't said it enough, we have a small, very vocal group of superconductors. And we call them superconductors. You can call them patrons, sponsors, whatever you want to call them.
People that listen to the show on a regular basis and just give us the energy of like 10,000 people. I don't know how many people listen to this show. And you can tell us if you listen to the show, we have like a whole feedback button that you can click in the show notes to do that.
But what I do know is that like the people that listen, they listen live, they listen after the fact, every single time someone comes in and just like, let's, let's me know how wrong I am about some hot take on some video or some movie or some TV show or whatever.
Or like, let's us know how amazing the last episode was or how it was like just what they needed to hear in that moment. Like that is the fuel that keeps the show going. Like this 100% the reason why we keep showing up and doing the thing. So again, anytime I get feedback like that, like happy 100.
This is so amazing. This is why I love being a superconductor. Like we do this just for that. That little bit of like dopamine rush that comes in when someone says, hey, you're being super helpful for us in my life and my career and my whatever. Like, thank you for that. Yeah.
It's, it's, it's, some might say it's unfortunate to pull your inspiration for my external forces to which I say, that's fair. That's fair. Well, we do have two more pieces of feedback. So I am going to play them right now.
I don't know if this will make the edit, but I wanted to include a little snippet of me saying how much this show means to me.
If I go back to listen to the original early episodes of the show, I can hear myself not just growing as a person, but planning major milestones of my life, including my wedding, buying my house, getting my master's degree.
And I feel fortunate to be able to do those things, but also share these moments with not just my family, but friends that I was able to build on this community through this show.
All the work that the team here at relay from Kathy, Jay, Javier, and all of the superconductors have built is, it's an amazing community. And I feel so fortunate to be a part of it. And I hope it keeps going so that other people are able to take in these moments as well. I'm not crying.
You're crying. No, definitely not crying here. No, not at all. For the record, this is the first time we're listening to these. Yeah, totally fine. Oh, man. So nameless, there used to be a joke that nameless actually put their name in the thing. And just, of course, me being the idiot that I am.
I'm just like, no, you have to be nameless if you're nameless. Right. Nameless, truly, you've become one of the people that I genuinely, seeing you hearing from you, even if when it's every other Tuesday, if we bumped into each other at a coffee shop and you're like, oh, it's nameless.
I would immediately give you the biggest hug. With consent. With consent, of course. But it would just be like just seeing so much. And nameless, like you are definitely like one of many, one of many people that are like that, but also just seeing how much has happened in the four years.
And more than anything, just having it all documented my goodness. Like, if you ever, we could, we could do a super cut for nameless of just like all of your connections throughout the years. It's been really amazing to just see how much life has changed for you.
And definitely just being a fan, being a fan of all that you've been doing and sharing from the sidelines has been, has been super awesome. So thank you. I mean, again, like we do this show for you. So thank you for the very awesome message. And Kathy, we have one more.
So hold it, hold it together. All right. Kathy and Jay, this is Sofe with a shout out for you. Congratulations on your 100th episode. This show has meant such a lot to me over the past few years. Before that, I'd spent years and years listening to productivity podcasts, which were fine.
There was nothing wrong with their ideas, but I didn't feel at home there. They felt like they weren't made for people who think like me or have bodies like mine and all the people who do productivity differently because we have to. And then there was conduit.
And I don't know if you know this, but when I started listening to this show, I was having a bit of a rough time. I was unemployed. I was seriously failing at writing the book. And I'd kind of given up on myself and my ability to achieve anything at all again.
And all of that has changed and the conduit community has been with me every step of the way with every fortnightly connection. And because you've explored so many great ideas and feelings on this podcast or so many feelings.
And because you've brought new diverse voices into the conversation, I've discovered new strategies for doing what works for me while loving and crying my way through quite a lot of your main topics.
And getting really invested in your whole community and the things they do and the people they are becoming. And that goes for both of you too. And it was so cool to meet you both at Relay 10 in London.
Thank you for creating a podcast where a disabled neurodivergent queer non-binary folk feels at home. And which also helps me bumble my way somehow into getting some of my stuff done. Cheers. Oh, day is so. You've lied. That's all fine. Yeah, we're fine. Meeting so many people there.
Ralezi, I know Ralezi's not live with us, but you know, they're one of the other ones that just stood out.
But yes, so I've, I think I've told so many people about, and they're like, oh, like, well, who listens to your show? And I was like, you know, we have, we have authors like World for Noun authors who listen, who listen in.
And like, we've helped them just through personal accountability, like, get books published and stuff. But again, like, there's, there's that like, in such a world where there's so many things happening and it's so serious for so many people for so long doing so much.
It's nice to be able to just have something. It just have something that you can go to when you're stressed out. Go have something to look forward to in a week that just sucks. Like folks, I'll be honest with you. Like, I told Kathy, I was like, stuff sucks for me right now.
But there was nothing that was going to prevent, like, just the joy of doing this show. And looking forward to this show, I've been looking forward to this for months now. Yes. I don't know how many times I've asked Kathy, like, is it up so far, I'm not sure yet. Right.
Well, in so many, I like, we're like trying to figure out which episode it is. And we're like, making sure that we're both going to be here because there was a light concern about like, it was going to be one of the, like, times that we were gone.
And that was thankfully, obviously, we're both here right now. And so we're doing it. We made it to episode 100 and I'm so incredibly proud of all of us. And the show is coming to its close, but that is the regular show. This episode is coming to a close, not the show. Not the show. Not the show.
No. The show will continue on. Yes, much, much, much, much longer. This episode is coming to a close, but we have some things to say. But before we do, I want to just let folks know that if you were going to become a super conductor, this would definitely be like the week to do it.
Because for the first time ever, our post show is going to be a live post show with our conductors. So we have a few people who are in the chat with us.
We will be sending out a Zoom link as soon as the show is over for them to come in and join us for the small celebration that is the wrap up of the 100th episode of Conduit. But before we get to that, oh, I guess the only way that you get to listen to that is by becoming a super conductor.
So if you would like to become a super conductor, you can become a member today. Go to I'm a superconductor.com. That is letter I, letter M, letter A, superconductor.com. Become a member, you'll get pre-impotio banter. The episodes are edited so that they're ad free.
And you get a co-working session in the off weeks with Kathy and myself. I'm Jay. But also we have all of these other connections that we forgot to do. I was listening. I did not forget. You were running the show.
I was here ready to say, oh, hey, by the way, we need to do the actual rest of the show. I kind of thought you were a little early, but you know what, that's okay. You're not wrong. You're not wrong. Okay. So erase everything that I said except for you. No, no. No. It's still very, yeah.
I am the worst of the two hosts in that I will just jumble everything up and then get lost in my own jumbling. This is the part of the show, not where we end the episode. But we do the thing that we got to do for the next week, the next two weeks, for tonight, that game.
Until the next episode, Kathy, what what what you going to do in the next for tonight? I am for realsies going to journal. I know that now I'm home for a while. I'm ready to sit and kind of do what is going on like with my life. So let's go, baby. I'm going to journal. Journaling is real.
What about you? I'm going to log my mood. I had a very vulnerable conversation earlier about how moody I've been. And I think a lot of it is just I got to get stuff off my chest. And onto my phone, I guess. So I'm going to lay on my phone.
And I'm just going to let all the emotions that are there just pour into it. And for those that don't know, I do just use the Apple track your mood today. I think it's the journaling app. I don't know what it is. Yeah, called journaling. Okay, so yeah. So we're both journaling.
My journaling will be mostly to just get stuff off my chest. And Kathy's will be to do unicorn things with journaling and Kathy thinks. What about our conductors? Yes. Starting with our profane sleep. Excuse me. Profane sleeper of the show, Mike, new connection, crying emoji.
There isn't one at least for a while. I'm stepping away from the community at large for a bit. And I wish the show continued success. So I do want to point out you do not need to be a superconductor in order to participate with connections.
And there is a link in the show notes or you can go to relay.fm slash conduit slash feedback and submit your connections through there. So you don't have to be a member of the discord. That's just the easiest way that we have it set up.
But you can load it into the feedback and we will get that as well. That is an option for you. So Mike, our profane sleeper, let us know if that's something you want to do. And if not, I also okay.
There have definitely been times where like one of the tropes I listened to all the podcasts in the world, every single one. And I have broken plenty of app trying to do so. And there are definitely times where I just need to step away from a show because it doesn't fit my schedule or whatever.
So like Mike, no hard feelings here. We hope that you'll continue to listen. We also again, like feel free to submit those connections through the public methods. Anybody can do so. So yeah, absolutely. Our checklist enthusiasts of the show who is also named Mike.
We weren't talking about you, Mike. You stay here. You don't go anywhere. It's to enjoy vacation and disconnect from work. Okay, fine. Go on vacation, whatever. Whenever your vacation is done, then make your way back and let us know how great it was. Yes. Hold on. I got one for this.
I've got to get to it because there we go. New connection. Oh, the show says I made some major strides entirely got my room these past couple of weeks as well. Now the big challenge unpacking the last couple boxes from the move, which may or may not have been two years ago. No, we're sappiness.
Something is crying. That's definitely the other sound bites that we need to get is every time Kathy goes, ah. Yes, yes, exactly. Excuse me. Our Oracle of the show. So says next connection.
I've got to edit someone's article, which I have terrible impostor syndrome about, but I'm going to focus on how I get to tell them how great they are and that they too can do the thing. Yes.
There's something about the fact that you can, you know, do as I say now, what is not as I do type of a thing where I can tell someone else how amazing they are, but not really believe it myself. And so you believe in that person, you just. Right, I don't know. I don't believe it for me.
And so the fact that so if I love this reconfiguration that you're like, oh, no, this is not like. Editing because I'm an incredible editor, which you probably are, but like I get to tell somebody how amazing they are.
So so leaning into that, I think is a perfect recognition and acknowledgement of it. So well done. I'm a writer, so I don't believe in ask me to lie to you. Yes. Our separate with the show Devos says next connection set up an appointment with a personal trainer. You got that. You can do it. Yes.
You can do it. Excuse me. Our chief swifty of the show Andrew says new connection over the next two weeks. I want you to find my role. We are all in the middle of a reorg of five people. It's a new feeling to step up for myself. I am so proud of you. That's so difficult.
And I know that you can do it. Yes. I have. I have survived a reorg or three in the last few years. So actually probably five in the last few years. Yes. Definitely can definitely know the feelings there, but also know that it's it is doable.
Our fish bear the show fishy guy says coming back to the classic connection check work through the pile of household admin. You know, you know, the household admin never stops.
It's the one thing in our lives that it's not like we don't just do it and then it's done and then we never have to do it again. Like these things sweep up over and over and over again. So no problem coming back to it. Yes.
So our robotics engineer of the show Aiden says next connection my girlfriend and I have decided to move in together. So next up is to figure out where we are moving and what we'll need to get ready for it to happen. Good luck, Aiden. I'm so excited for both of you.
So a little bit of conduit lore here. Aiden is one of the few conductors that I've gotten to hang out with in person. And I am super excited because I also got to hang out with aiden's girlfriend.
So it's it's like truly just one of those things of feeling like I get to be a small friend and a part of that that little bubble. And you'll have to let me personally Aiden know where you moved to so I can send you all a housewarming gift.
But meanwhile our Canadian trivia card enthusiasts of the show Erica says next connection. Let's try this again. I'm going to use my fancy new makeup brush cleaner and also manually clean my dishwasher filter. That yeah, that that sounds gross. I'm sorry.
I'm glad I don't have to do either of those things. But you can do it. I believe in you. Or sure. Oh, I got I got the one for you. Yeah, we got this one. Let me see here. New connection, nameless of the show.
I want to be able to get ahead on some of the documentation I need for my teams for the event they're coming up in the next few months. If I'm not prepared, they're not prepared. So it's better to be over prepared. Also, I want to follow up on the applications I sent out these last fortnight.
I don't want to get lost in the mix, especially on these jobs that I really were it was interested in. Oh, man, that's yes. I can think of like five or six things that just came out of that. And it's also like if I'm not prepared, they're not prepared. Yes.
I feel this with every fabric of my being right now. If only I could go in more detail. But yes, yes. But also I have learned that over preparedness doesn't happen as often as we think it does.
So I don't think like maybe don't look at it as being over prepared, but maybe look at it as being like more fully prepared. Yes. Just as a thought. And then we got one more. Oh, wait, no, we don't have one. Look, it's a, I guess one to read. Yes. Yes.
Our tech podcast listener of the show, Pilex says new connection work on fun things, I guess. Probably some bilatromod. I don't know. I don't have anything to do. Yes. That's a, that's a fun time to be in as one is like I can work on things because I got nothing else to do right now.
It's just, which is really cool. Okay. So now if you would like to submit your own connection, please do so whether you're a member or not. If you are a relay member or a superconductor specifically, you can do so in the relay discord in the hashtag show follow up channel.
