From RelayFM, you're listening to Conduit, the show where we condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that always LMN O&Ps. Please.
This week's episode is brought to you by Anthropic, the makers of Claude, and you, lovely humans, who are going to donate to St. Jude. I'm trying to find the page, Kathy. Give me a break. Oh my gosh, I literally wrote it all out. This episode is brought to you by St.
Jude Children's Research Hospital and Claude from Anthropic. I am Jay, who totally has it under control since it's my week. And with me is Kathy, internet busy unicorn, that whole thing. Hi, Kathy. Hi, Jay. I regret everything. And with us is a special guest.
And John, we're not, I'm not going to say this because I am terrified to say your last name because I didn't ask you before how to pronounce it. But what I'm going to do instead is we're going to go in the flavor of Tim Apple. This is John P. Hi, John. Hi. Thanks for having me.
I'm pretty sure Kathy and I have referred to you as John P. for most of the time. And then I was like, actually, no, I'm pretty sure it's John G. And I often, if someone emails me for the app, I'll write back, I'll sign it, John G, creator of P. Nice. Nice. I love it.
So as a creator of, obviously, the phonetic alphabet, among other things, why don't you give people a brief introduction to who you are, what you do, and how we might know about you in the conduit world? Well, I make an app called P. It's just the letter P.
And it's a hydration app, a water reminder app. And there are many water reminder apps. But this one is different. It is based on how often you pee instead of how much water you drink, which is a scientifically research-backed way to measure your hydration.
And so I made it originally kind of as a joke, but then it kind of actually turned out to be a pretty decent way to measure hydration. And yeah, it's a fun app. Agreed. We'll probably talk much, much more about this in the second half of the show. But first, we got to get through all of the chores.
Kathy, what happened this week in the Discord? Yeah, it's all iPhones, St. Jude and Podcast-a-thon. In case you don't know, we are in September right now, which means Hardcore St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Raising Money Time, period. And it's fantastic. And I love this time of year.
I love the energy. I love the busyness in the Discord. And this is my Roman Empire. And I'm so happy that it's here again. And also, we are two weeks out from... Nope. No. Is it... Oh, my gosh. One week. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Sorry. Hold on.
We are one week out from me getting on a plane to head to Memphis. So it's almost podcasts on time. And that makes me excited. And I have a lot to do. So let's continue on with this podcast. I love it. And then last week at our co-working, it was extra small.
Someone forgot to send out the email, but that's okay. We'll forgive her. That was actually me, not Jay pretending that it was me. I actually did. Because I had set up... Because we switched our times, I set up the reminders wrong.
I'm just reading the notes that Kathy left me and putting my own embellishments in there. Yeah. Honestly, we had a great time. We almost got Kathy to buy an espresso machine, which was super awesome. I don't know. Did you ever get that espresso machine? No. No. I haven't bought it yet. Okay. Cool.
I haven't bought any of it. Yeah. So thank you to the folks who did attend. Obviously, if you didn't make it, we understand. Because you didn't get the email reminder. And that's okay. Admin, we won't be having co-working next week. Because Kathy will be getting on a plane to Memphis.
And I will be in Los Angeles trying not to drop my phone in the LA River. That's a very good goal. Yeah. Yeah. I'll be running around. If you're going to be at AWS Summit Los Angeles, come say hi. Come find me. I'll be at the booth that I work at. And I'll take a picture.
I'll buy you a drink or something. We'll figure it out. But if hanging out with us, be it in the Discord, be it at conferences, or in our co-working calls, any of that sounds fantastic, consider becoming a superconductor.
You get access to the pre- and post-show banter where we got to pester John with our early takes. I did some live commenting from the Apple keynote that's happening right now. And yeah, it's all kinds of fun.
We also get access to the post-show, which I can't tell you what is happening this time because the post-show, it might be shorter than usual because I've got something immediately after this that I have to go to. But yeah, visit imasuperconductor.com to become a member today.
Letter I, letter M, letter A, superconductor.com. Also, be sure to email Kathy at Kathy at Relay FM if you want to become a sponsor of the show. We have a special rate for those individuals who just want to sponsor the show and be super awesome.
And that's Kathy at Relay dot FM because Kathy at Relay at FM will not go anywhere. Yeah, you know how the Internet works. Kathy, it's time for one good thing. We don't have a buzzer for that one. So one good thing. Kathy, what was one good thing that happened? Yeah.
In case you missed it, the Hamilton movie was in theaters. I went. It was so much fun. I haven't had that much fun in a theater with other people for a while.
The sheer joy of being there, even though after I went to the bathroom and came back and I almost killed myself on the stairs because it goes three, two, two, two. And I missed that. It was three in the first steps. But it's fine. I'm OK. Everyone else is OK. It's it's it's OK.
The movie delightful. We're not laughing at Kathy's mishaps. No, of course not. Not everyone. By the way, everyone that I went with absolutely dying, laughing, laughing. It was embarrassing. Thankfully, it was dark. So nobody could see how red my face was. Oh, now I feel bad for laughing.
My one good thing. I made a plant tracker for my plants. I have over 20 plants now. I don't know. I don't know how this happened, but here we are. So I am in the process of figuring all of that out. And then, yeah, I made it. You can use it if you want.
What I will say is I made it as someone who is trying to dive more into database knowledge and learning and stuff. So I vibe coded the rest. And if you don't like that or you don't like how I did it, then you don't have to use it. But it's so cool. I added photos features to it today.
And it's meant to be ran locally on your machine so that you can just you just sit there, have it running, add photos to your plant tracker. Make sure you log when you watered it. It's like the P app for plants.
John, do you have one good thing that happened this week? And it's totally OK to say no, because we forgot. I didn't. I wasn't expecting. No, it's OK. It's OK. I mean, I can always come up with one. I took a nice long walk today. Four and a half miles. That is one good thing. Wow. That is amazing.
Well done. Awesome. And then we have some shout outs from our audience. Our checklist enthusiast of the show said, Kathy, I heard you mention you capture stuff in reminders via Siri when driving and et cetera.
I have a shortcut that imports stuff from the reminders inbox into Todoist, but can easily be modified for OmniFocus. Maybe it'll help. And provided a link to the shortcut. Yes. I'm very excited. I haven't done it yet because shortcuts scare me. I know. I know. It's ridiculous. But they do.
For a decade, Kathy. I know. And it still intimidates me. And but I also got a shortcut set from of the show who does a really, really cool, fancy thing with the action button that I want to try and replicate.
It basically when he hits the action button, if it's if the phone is in landscape mode, it toggles rotation lock. So that way, like it will turn it on or turn it off. So you can like whatever. Otherwise, if it's portrait upside down in a pocket, it will and overcast is playing.
It will skip the chapter. Otherwise, it turns on do not disturb. And if it's neither of those, it opens a quick action menu with things like logging weight, logging drink, logging food, walking dog, start workout and workout, etc. Which is magic. And it's very complicated.
And I don't fully understand it yet. But maybe I will get less scared here shortly. That sounds like a lot. Yeah. Yeah. But it's very cool. And I'm hoping I'm hoping I can be less scared later on. Then our identical twin of the show, Aaron, said he just reminded us of the conversation.
Yes, last episode where I mentioned that the first time Kathy and I got to meet was in London, in which Kathy reminded me literally we met about 15 minutes from where I live. Yes. And he said, I love this show. We'd love that you love this show.
And then lastly, I actually got this message as well or a similar message. I were I was really excited about this. I said, Jay, what you said about fatherhood and the worries about being a good father very much resonated with me.
If you ever wanted to record a podcast about this, I would be honored. If you, someone I respect greatly, were to join me on mine as a guest. Oh, yeah, that would be cool. Tell Kathy not to worry. I handled the editing and hosting. That's great. You don't know what you're asking.
I mean, I'm just I would say if you're if you already have a show. And I can just appear and run my mouth and then disappear into the ether. I'm really good at that. So, yeah, I would I would love to do that. Just send me the details because I am the next month is going to be a nightmare for me.
So it might be it might have to be sometime in October. That's it for those. And now it's time for the thing we all know. We all love the thing that you should never do while rubbing your feet with socks on on carpet. It's time for the connection check because you might get that. Yeah. Yeah. Wow.
Wow. Kathy, how'd you do? Um, so I'm putting an orange. So my connection was to finalize my passport renewal. And I'm putting an orange circle because I went to the Walgreens to get my passport photo taken. And every time it was, quote unquote, broken.
Now, I am not claiming that they were lying to me because they didn't want to do it. But I'm not not stating that that might be correct. So I need to find somewhere else to go to get my photo taken. And yes, I am aware I can do it myself.
But it's so particular that it's just easier for me to have somebody else do it, except clearly when the camera's not working. So I've never seen a photographer less wanting to take a photo. Yeah. Yeah. It's there's so many pieces involved to make sure it's right.
And if you get it wrong, you have to go and like do it again. And I just I just don't want to do that. I mean, they're probably more on edge now, now that you got AI where you can just generate someone's face and then be like, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, thank you. Worse now.
John, what about you? Well, I submitted ahead of time when you asked me to be on that I was going to submit an update of P for iOS 26 with liquid glass to the app store, like with the updated design. I have it ready to go, but they haven't opened it up yet. I guess I wasn't sure of the timing.
So whenever whenever it's possible to submit the update, I will submit it. But it's ready to go. It's in test flight. So hopefully everything's fine. So I did a yellow or orange circle. I think everything that you could have done on your end. And I mean, yeah, you're looking for beta testers.
I will I will personally update to the iOS 26 beta so that I can beta test the P app. Wow. All right. Wow. That's you. You've got my word on that unless unless they just make it public today and then I'll be like, well, OK, I guess I'll just update.
I was supposed to do informal desires planning document. Immediately after that show, I went and got lunch with Brittany and I asked her if she knew what to do and she said about what and I said exactly. And then I continued to go ahead and forget that I ever assigned myself this task.
That's what you get for forcing me to try to be an adult. I know. I know. And yet. And yet here we are. What about our conductors? Yeah. So Carl of all trades of the show, Carl says connection check red green ogre battle with a star that says deep cut.
I missed the cut, but that's OK because Carl missed the last check in. So here is mine from events a month ago. I successfully managed to cosplay Freddie Mercury. There was, however, two major hiccups.
My stylist had no clue who Queen or Freddie was and lopped off my mustache while trimming my beard. Right when all the other Freddies were leaving the bar to get judged, who was the best? My friend showed up. I was buying us drinks. I did not make it to the judging.
Later, the organizer texted me to ask where I went because I was a shoe in to win. It was a great free concert. I mean, that sounds like a heck of a journey and very memorable. And I'm glad that you actually like seemed like you had fun, which was great.
I still can't get over the like my stylist had no clue who Queen or Freddie Mercury was. Right. They literally just made a movie. I mean, just, you know, five years ago or whatever. But yeah. No, I know. I know. Our code monkey of the show, Douglas, said broken heart.
I have been very bad at doing my connection checks or even getting anything productive done in the last few weeks. I'm sorry to hear that. That I think we go through spurts. Sometimes we're like, we're on it. We're on the ball. We're doing stuff.
And then there's just some weeks where we can't even or odd. So no, no worries on that. And hopefully, hopefully we'll get some small, small wins for you to get you back on it. Yes. All right, John, would you like to do the next one? Oh, I didn't know. I was. Okay. You don't have to. This.
Oh, okay. The robotics engineer of the show. Yeah. Okay. Dead green heart. I finally made that phone call and it went about as well as it possibly could, even if I did never or did need an interpreter. Oh, now we just have to assume what these calls are.
I'm guessing that the robotics engineer of the show is secretly applying for a super secret robotics team in the Chengdu region of China. And that's why I needed an interpreter. Wow. That's what I'm saying. I know nothing. Our identical twin of the show. Aaron says connection check. A green circle.
I had a lovely week off with my girlfriend, despite some cooler weather that came our way. Some learnings for the next time we go camping. But being back at work, I miss it already. I'm so happy you had a good time. Camping still sounds terrible to me, but I'm glad you had fun.
Our doll of the show, Molly, said yellow heart, green heart. Got car inspected. Dealership doesn't have my plates, though, which is annoying. Oh, yeah. Yeah, they should. They need to get on that. Hopefully they'll mail it to you.
John, you want to get our soprano of the show? Do I say the name that's in the left column? First names are OK. Like, that's OK. And I should say the one in clips. I just don't know the format. Yes. OK. Soprano of the show. Debo? Debo? Yep. Debo. Yep. Yep. Says green heart. Mended my choir robe.
Amazing. Our shark of the show, Chris, says connection check. My connection was to prepare for my mother-in-law's arrival. Green checkmark. She left for home this past Monday. Excellent. You survived. Hooray. Our fish pair of the show, Fishy Kai, says green circle.
We managed to get all the school supplies and schedules and clothes and et cetera in time. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. I'm so glad I get to do this one because I always hear it. On the show. I did. The ah of the show. Ah. Says Red X.
Despite the extra week, I've been super busy and I didn't get around to getting my doom piles undoomed. But that's on the docket for tonight. I still love Oz when he did the voice recording thing. It was just like. Yes. That was so fun. The bohem screen. That's what it is. That's what it's called.
Yes. Go ahead. The nameless of the show. Nameless says connection check green circle. I got the job offer. Yes. We're so happy for you. After what felt like forever. I finally got word yesterday that I have been select that they have selected me for the role. Party face. Also, Mrs.
Nameless and I had a great time on our anniversary trip that we couldn't find time to fit in a meeting with our favorite unicorn. Yeah, I kept looking for you at our event that we were at, but I'm so glad you had an amazing time in Portland.
I was also so glad that you were able to celebrate Conduit's like third year anniversary, you know, in Portland. That's such a good time. I'm standing by. That's why. OK. OK. Our checklist enthusiast of the show, Mike, said Green Check actually finished the planning process for the St.
Jude campaign. Hey, St. Jude campaigns. St. Jude campaigns. I launched it at Coindaddy.me. Let's let's just that's a weird. OK, so Coindaddy is the name for. So if you get one dollar donated to the fundraiser, you get the challenge coin.
And so Coindaddy is people that will go around and find someone that has no donations made in their fundraiser and donates at least a dollar so that they will get a coin. So that's what the Coindaddy is. Oh, OK. So wait, I just donate a dollar to the Coindaddy campaign. That's what I do.
Well, I mean, no, you it's OK. Visit Coindaddy.me and find out. I'm trying. I'm trying to figure out what this is doing. OK. Was there one more? Yes. Yes. I'll do the last one. Artist of the show. Carly. Yes. Yellow Square. I haven't been applying to as many jobs as I should.
I currently have a temp job and the contract has been extended a few times, but won't last forever. You got this. You got this, Carly. So this month is Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. And since our first relay for St. Jude campaign in 2019, we have raised over four million dollars as a community.
We want to add even more to that total. And every one of our listeners can be a part of helping us achieve that. The first St. Jude led clinical trial to open in resource limited countries was recently announced. In May 2025, St. Jude announced GloboTrack.
A clinical trial for children up to three years old who have brain tumors with specific genetic changes. St. Jude is partnering with doctors worldwide to recruit patients in the U.S. as well as in Egypt, India, Jordan, Brazil, and Peru.
As part of the trial, patients will have a biopsy of their cancer taken to be reviewed at St. Jude. Conducting global trials is important because pediatric cancer is not isolated to the U.S. Making progress means partnering with doctors internationally to help young patients everywhere.
GloboTrack is about finding the best treatment for patients, something St. Jude is committed to on a global scale, says St. Jude lead Dr. Daniel Morera. We're inviting the Relay community to continue the incredible generosity shown over the last seven years.
And once again, make a donation to support the life-saving mission of St. Jude. Please go to stjude.org slash Relay to make a donation today.
You can also set up a fundraiser of your own and see the amazing incentives available to donors this year, including if you raise $1, you will get the challenge relay action. You will get six. No, three.
Three two-sided Relay Challenge coins with images of all six hosts that are doing the podcast-a-thon this year. It's really, really cool. Plus, learn how to give with a donor-advised fund, DAF, or check to see if your employer will match your online donation. And remember to mark your calendars.
The podcast-a-thon will be on Friday, September 19th on the Relay YouTube channel starting at 12 p.m. Eastern. Help give them more tomorrows. Go to stjude.org slash Relay to donate or start your own fundraiser today. We love St. Jude. We do. I am in the process of making my donation right now.
I am hitting checkout. This will be my second donation for St. Jude this year. And I am going to say the best host of the show. And I'm just going to leave that like that. Like that. Wow. You always come out fighting. Even for the kids. For the kids. Yep.
So I will leave that for Kathy to have to deal with. Yep. Donation made. Y'all know me. I'm from Tennessee. And the best thing to ever come out of Tennessee was St. Jude. The second best thing to come out of Tennessee is a smoked bologna sandwich.
And the third best thing to come out of Tennessee is the University of Tennessee. St. Jude is definitely number one. And I am once again very jealous of all of the people around me who get to go and do this amazing thing. For the third year in a row.
I threw my hat in to say if you need anything let me know. And then immediately got shut down. Not because they didn't want me there. But because I think I'm actually traveling. That same week. You are. Every year. You're like I want to do this. And then you are always traveling.
So this is on you dude. Yeah. One day I won't be able to travel anymore. And then I will make the trek to Memphis. And be able to contribute to the fun and the amazingness that is the Relay podcast-a-thon that happens. That I've been following for years and years and years.
Even before I was a host. And again this is one of those things that I'm very much like. I see no downsides to this. So why not throw your hat in the ring. Even a dollar. As someone who works. Who has. You know. I have my own non-profit. And I think I've told people this in the past.
When you send a bunch of money all at once. That is great. And that is appreciated. And that is fantastic. However there is an option here that I think that people are probably sleeping on. And that is setting up that monthly giving. When people can rely on an amount of money coming monthly.
That gives you the ability to handle things that pop up out of nowhere. So that reduces the amount that you have to save for. Oh what happens when we don't raise a bajillion dollars. Like Relay has done consistently. And like when times get hard. Those big donations.
Like you have to save all that and tuck it away. Those monthly donations help make you more confident in what you're capable of doing. Day to day. Week to week. Month to month. So I don't know anything about AllSAC's financials. But what I do know is I've talked to a bunch of non-profits.
And all of them say the same thing. They would much rather have $5 a month than $60 a year. Because it gives them what they know that they can operate with every single time. Even with the fees. Even with the penalties. Yes. Agreed. Donate today. And then maybe next month donate some more.
Or just set up monthly giving. Because you can do this. Yep. This is your show Jay. Oh I thought there was a second half to the ad read. No. That's it. Help give them more tomorrows. Go to stju.org slash Relay to donate or start your own fundraiser today. Thanks. Awesome people. So.
We're here to talk about pee. I just have to say. This app gives me so much joy. Not just because of how helpful and amazing it is. But the name just being pee. It makes me smile every time. And it's silly. And I love it. I mean it's not silly the app. But like it's silly my reaction to every time.
I'm like I'm using pee. Thanks. I'm glad you like it. I was going to ask. John. You mentioned that like obviously there's science backed by it. But you were kind of just making it to make it. And then you were like actually this is pretty good. Like was there.
Was it like all of a sudden your friends were like hey what's that app. You know that's really good. Or did you notice like your own like hydration habits improving. Like what was that that verifier for you. Oh I made the app originally just for myself. Because I was getting headaches quite a bit.
Like even since I was a kid I would get headaches. And I kind of thought it was because I wasn't drinking enough water. And one day I was laying in bed with a headache. And I knew there were a bunch of apps. Where people track how much water they drink.
And I just kind of thought that seemed like a lot of work. And like it wasn't really that helpful. Because you know it changes what your body needs. If you're sweating a lot. If you're you know walking outside. And it's hot out versus staying inside. And not really doing much.
You have different water needs. And so I was laying in bed with a headache. And I thought what if I just make something. Where I tell it when I pee. And it reminds me to drink water. When it's been a long time since I peed. So yeah that was that's where it came from. It's fantastic.
Because I had that. I had the same experience of. Oh let me track my water. Because I drink a lot of water. Some of previous episodes. I've talked a little bit about this. How my anxiety is actually seems to be tied to how hydrated I am. And when I'm fully hydrated. I don't have anxiety.
And so I was like oh let me try tracking my water. You're right. It was so annoying. It was so frustrating. Because it's like how much did I actually drink? Like did I just take a sip? Did I take a gulp? Like what. How am I. How am I tracking this? Like what.
What are you talking about? And sometimes I'll have multiple. So I have a water bottle that lives at my desk. And a water bottle that lives by the couch. For when I'm working from the couch. And like all of these pieces. And so I can't just like oh finish this water bottle.
And then when it's done you know. And so using this app has helped make sure that I am doing what I need to do to not be anxious. And it's easy. I use the Apple Watch complication. Super easy to just go in and tap. I also really appreciate the oh hey I logged.
I went pee you know 30 minutes ago or 60 minutes ago. I use that all the time because I'll be like oh yeah I forgot to push the button. But it's easy enough to just like that still reminds me. And I still could be like oh yeah I did actually go pee. And I it's just so easy.
And I love an app that is simple. I don't have to fidget with. I don't have to feel overwhelmed. I don't have to like do any complicated setup to make it work. It just does what it needs to do. And it has really really helped me make sure that I am doing what I need to do to stay healthy.
Thanks I'm glad to hear that. And yeah the one of the biggest thing like that that 30 minutes ago and 60 minutes ago and being able to enter the time. It's not something I originally had in there.
But one of the biggest issues that people would contact me about is that they would get frustrated because they would forget. And then there wasn't really a good way to catch up. Yeah. You know so that's that's where that came from.
But you mentioned a really important thing about water tracking too that it's not always just water. A lot of the I've learned a lot about hydration since making this app. And you know the anxiety thing is is real because there's there's a hormone that your body makes when it needs to retain water.
And that hormone also does things like influencing your blood pressure and and other things about your body. So yeah the benefits of hydration are huge and even though I made it for headaches.
I've heard from so many people who use it for preventing kidney stones preventing UTIs you know things like that. There's so many things that that help you know your make you so much healthier when you're drinking more water and all the water.
It's not always coming from just drinking water to you get so many water molecules from all kinds of food. And so this is a way that you factor that all in. But it's it's meant to be the simplest habit to adopt to actually get an effective measurement of your hydration. Yes.
One of the things that I've been more and more impressed by is how much you've you've crammed. I think I think I even mentioned that of like hey like I found some new feature. I just found another new feature since I last checked settings.
Which again I don't ever need to check settings to log my P. Now you can add notes to your P. Oh. Yeah that's been in there actually for for a while at least a few years now. But I rearranged the settings recently because it was getting kind of confusing.
And and there's always there's so much more I want to do with the app. But but yeah the notes is actually mostly like a kind of a medical feature where there are people that will use it for different reasons.
And some people want to keep track of things like the color or urgency or the amount or you know any any variety of different things. So I've had a lot of different requests for different types of fields and things from users over the years.
But I added the notes field as a way to you know let people add whatever they want. And then you know I might add some other more specific fields that are optional later.
But yeah I'm glad you I'm glad you appreciate all the different little things because I've really tried to you know make it a fully featured app where you know it really kind of becomes part of your life.
And and you get a lot of benefit from it like I don't know if you've seen the location feature where you can save the location with every P and then you get a map of basically like where you've been in your life. Yeah travels and everything.
Funny enough there are things like that that I like I have a I have a friend who has type 1 diabetes and he developed kind of a similar Android app for himself that connected to his Dexcom his insulin.
 Track reader and it was one of those things where he could if he was feeling off he could go back and he could look through it and be like oh yeah I was over here and like right after we ate here I had like an insulin spike or I had like my blood my blood sugar dropped really badly over here in this area.
And it allowed him to start building around habits. Obviously like you know we talked about like a shy bladder and things like you know things like that or even things that might pop up. And just to be like yo the bathrooms in this one really really nice. Yeah. I do that. I definitely do that.
Make note of the bathroom. Or if I forgot this is the problem too is if you if you forget to log it the app is only getting your location when you hit that button basically. So if you do 30 minutes or 60 minutes ago it doesn't end up getting the location. Oh yeah.
So then I'll put a note like oh how is it this place there's something in the notes. But the notes is a subscriber one of the subscriber features.
There are some features that are subscribers only but I do have a promotion in the app where if you if you have to if you add two friends with the friends feature then you get access to the subscriber features for free. I don't know if note sharing is a feature that I want.
That's oh that's not a yeah there's no no sure. All the data is private. I you know designed it in a way where it does get backed up to your private to your cloud kit account or your iCloud account. Yeah. But I don't have any way to access that data. It's not on a server that I control.
It goes into your iCloud account. Amazing. For some reason I thought I had subscribed already but I didn't and I'm like well I need to go in and do that even though I do have two friends that I share with. I was like nope I need to because I thought I already had and surprise I did not.
So that's fixed. Change that. Thank you. Thank you. The thing I was going to bring up was I am actually kind of in a place where I need to access some some like time series data for work.
So you don't understand how tempted I've been to just like part of my day job is like giving talks about stuff about data. So I was like yo let's look at my P records. I feel like there's there's got to be an easier way to to spread that data or to talk about that data in a way.
But I do I do love the privacy aspect of it of like again I don't need I don't need Amazon or Google knowing the location to which where IP or the frequency. Because I feel like I feel like I feel like that will get abused.
But also I do like the fact that you know hey if you need those records if you need to send something to your doctor like that's a thing that you can just export really quick and then email them. Like it isn't it's it's it's as easy or as hard to share the data as it needs to be.
It's not it's not overly complicated and it's it's not just like every single P that you log is being sent to like 100 places. So what other types of apps do you do like how did you get started with developing how did you get started with you know making these things.
We heard a little bit about how you started with P but what about developing as a whole. Well I've been I this I've been interested in you know software development for a long time and actually the first I didn't know how to make iPhone apps yet when I made the first version of P. P.
It was actually a Ruby on Rails app. It was a web app. So I started with that and then I built I like was just learning how to build iOS apps. And this was back in 2016. So the apps actually been around since 2015.
So the apps been around for almost 10 years now even though I started it I put it out there. It was very early version and then it you know it was kind of just out there. I didn't really work on it much because I was working on other projects.
But then I was getting more and more email from people that you know it was really helping them. So then I decided later to you know take it a bit more seriously and actually build it out more. But along the way I have built some other apps.
And through building the Apple Watch app specifically I learned a lot about just developing for the Apple Watch. I started Apple Watch development even with the first Apple Watch in 2015. So that's something I've always tried to you know be good at and build my skills on.
So I have another app that's actually a health related app and it's called Beat Watcher. And so that one is like an always on heart rate monitor for the Apple Watch. So originally I made it as a like a stress monitoring app. And the way that it works is you pick a heart rate like let's say 110 BPM.
And then you set it to that and you hit start and you leave the app. And it just runs in the background. And it keeps the heart rate monitor on on your Apple Watch. And anytime immediately when your heart rate goes above the threshold to above 110 in this case.
It vibrates and plays if you have the sound on it plays a noise to indicate your heart rate went above that. And then that makes you aware you can realize oh maybe I just got a stressful email or something. You know what's going on what just changed.
And you can you know take a step back think about it and you know try to reduce your heart rate. But that's one I just it was like a fun little project I made and I put it out there and then I started hearing from people who were who had different medical conditions who were using it.
And then I you know actually built it out a little bit more. It's still a very simple app like that but but people use that with different medical conditions because the alternative is some kind of specialty device.
You know that's not an Apple Watch and I've heard from people who bought Apple Watches just to be able to you know have that real time heart rate monitoring with with be watcher. Yeah no that's got to be super helpful.
There's so many layers involved with and I'm I'm sure they're going on right now during the Apple event you know with Apple Watch of like how how how many health saving things are part of the Apple Watch.
But the fact that like it's it's still not perfect and being able to give an opportunity for you to come in and be like hey we're going to do this. And make it work and be able to support people in what they're doing.
I feel like that has got to be really not refreshing but like really nice to to hear from people saying hey this is working. This is great. I love this type of a type of a situation. There's also just the preferred style like I just realized this as you mentioned you'd made other apps.
I was like let me go find these other apps. I have used Juice Watt for like. At least a year. Really. Longer than that probably. Again it's just I don't keep my watch on me but I literally just typed in Juice Watt and it was like open.
And I was like what do you mean open? What is Juice Watt? John what is Juice Watt? Juice Watt is an app. I originally made it because I had an Aura ring. I think this was in like 2018. And it would send a notification when the ring was done charging.
And I thought well that'd be nice to have for the Apple Watch. You know so you would leave the watch on a charger and then it would you'd get a notification on your phone when it's done charging. And since then Apple has added that to the you know as like a built-in feature.
But it wasn't at the time. So that was the original reason I built it. But then it also puts a gauge a complication on the watch face that shows your iPhone's battery level.
And that's been really helpful to people who I've heard from nurses and people who work in restaurants and people that are just you know on their feet a lot and have to leave a phone plugged in in another room. Yeah.
And you can kind of monitor it from your wrist and see it'll show a little lightning bolt when it's charging or if it stops charging for some reason. It'll show you know what the current battery level is.
And then you can also put your Apple Watch and iPhone charge level on the same complication which is just kind of nice to have sometimes you know to save some complication space. And again there are other apps that do that but I tried to just make a very simple app that did it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
There's nothing. With no apps. Definitely. Yeah.
 Nothing wrong with with easy simple basic that works like if it works and does what you need it to do it doesn't need extra things which I feel like is a especially in this world where you know you can now play games on your Netflix and and all of these random things that come out that are just like but I like just knowing.
Hey if I need to do X I go to Y type of thing. I think that's really there's something to be said about that simplicity and keeping it not overwhelming for the user said from somebody who easily gets overwhelmed with fancy apps and things that you're doing. So yeah I love it. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. What else do you have. Thank you. What else do you have on your. Like what else is coming down the pipe other than amazing P updates. Well actually with P specifically I've been trying to focus more on marketing. It's just me doing these apps.
I'm building them and kind of just doing everything. Yeah. And so with P specifically I'm pretty happy with the percentage of people who actually pay for it. I'm really happy with the retention and the like app store reviews and ratings and the feedback I get.
So it makes me realize that it's not an app for everybody but for the people that do like the concept and get it. They really love it. Yeah. And there are also all these apps out there that are for tracking water intake and I just think that I want to get the app in front of more people.
That's why I started buying some podcast ads. Yeah. You know through relay. And so that's really what I'm I even though there's so much I want to do developing the app itself. I've been trying to just force myself to spend more time marketing it.
And I also heard from I think I forgot to mention this earlier but around a few years ago I heard from a professor who has spent most of his career researching hydration.
And he contacted me basically to tell me that he had found my app and that P tracking like he has research that he's done that shows that P tracking is a great way to measure hydration for most people. So that kind of gave me a lot more confidence to push forward with it.
That's that's incredible getting that validation from people that this is their job has got to be even like obviously I'm sure people telling you hey I love this app is is still incredible but having somebody that like yeah you're right. This is this is great.
This is you know what needs needs to happen I feel like is really special. I yeah it makes me think it's like actually the better alternative to the water tracking apps which makes me more motivated to really try to get it out there in front of people more. Yeah.
One of the things that I feel like your apps do is one like they've solved your problems but they solve your problems and like the lowest stress way.
And in in that is there I mean is there any advice maybe that you can give to people you know I guess relay listeners conduit listeners who might be dealing with like I have a problem and like trying to solve the problem brings on stress.
Because I mean like that's that's the thing that I've seen with this more than anything is it like I struggle with drinking water. And for me like I don't think of the P app as a like oh you only logged three this time you should be drinking more water. Yeah. Yeah.
It's just a like subtle like oh hey yeah I probably should go drink some more water and then I immediately get up and go drink water and like say oh hey I've done the thing without like guilting myself into it because the overall feeling of it was stress free.
So yeah again like I said I would love for you just to speak on the idea of like do you do you consider solving problems like in the least stress free way or I guess most stress free way something that you do intentionally or did that just kind of happen.
 Um well with P specifically I definitely was trying to think of something that would be simple and easy to keep up with um and that would actually provide useful feedback um and it just you know I I think it was just kind of like a simple idea and I tried it and it worked um I've tried other ideas in the past you know for different things that that haven't worked but um I think it's just like anything I build I try to keep it.
 I keep it pretty simple and focused um and even though like for example P has a lot of these extra features uh I try to keep it simple on the surface and then you know if people want to dive in deeper they can um but I like the idea of you know just kind of having an app that does something well in a focused way without ads um and so I think that's kind of been my philosophy when it comes to building apps but honestly like you had said um the apps that I've made are all things I've really wanted to build for myself and that I've wanted myself and uh and I want those to just be simple nice things to use.
Incredible.
 Yeah I love I love this idea too about the mindset that you're going into it with the with the no apps that you're like hey between like making making it just present but not overwhelming with you know the type of work that you're doing with the app so like going in logging it done you can do other stuff there's other things to you know do but you keeping that basic core um and you're not having to worry about like stressful with ads which I'm sure we all know how annoying they can be but also being able to easily support the app through um subscribing with the advanced features um but there's also I noticed there's it's really there's a kindness to it so like when you get that reminder of you know you haven't gone pee in a while it's not uh don't forget for your health you totally need to do this and there's no annoying like palette that says and just have it play please don't but there's also not a oh I'm really disappointed in you on Tuesday of this week you had fewer peas than you normally do like there's no like recounting of how bad you were one day or another which I feel like sometimes health apps tend to do because they're like oh this is something that you know we need to remind you that oh you haven't worked out this week or or make sure you're eating the right number of calories or anything like that this this has that level of almost kindness and support which I really I really appreciate thanks yeah the I mean the calendar does have like you know if you look at the calendar which is where it kind of color codes the different days um it does turn red and you know sometimes people get mad about how it's red and and uh or has the the face with the x's on the eyes you know yeah yeah it's the reminders like five hours or more but I try to just keep it like fun and like like a kind of jokey yeah so it doesn't come across hopefully as mean you know I don't want it to be annoying or mean and I know from hearing from users that a lot of people do get really annoyed with the notifications but you know I just tell them hey maybe hydration isn't for you right maybe you should pee more yeah yeah I I it's all subtle and like you still have to kind of go in there so yes you know I it's been three and a half hours um no 3.
6 hours now since I've peed last because getting ready for podcasts and and all of that and it has the oh little stressful face but it's not like and it will come in and do that reminder every half hour which is the perfect in my opinion that perfect balance of like okay I know you're busy but hey don't forget type of a situation um and the ability to postpone the the reminder is also helpful like I can't go pee right now like this is not a time that is okay uh and so being able to to tap the reminder of like you know remind me in a little bit instead um is is really nice and yes the little like tracking if you're if you're going into the app but the fact that it's not I I don't need a daily like check-in of like hey this is how many times you peed if I want to see that I can go find it but it's not that default which I feel like happens a lot and that's really really helpful I love it I'm not gonna lie I do kind of wish that the the colors were a little friendlier for me but I know that that's a personal problem and that's not like that's like hey I should actually oh good oh I've actually thought about making them uh you know customizable oh yeah that's like one of the things because I know people love themes and stuff like that so uh it is something I've thought about you know especially or there are issues with um kind of accessibility issues where uh some of the the colors when you're um like if it's in grayscale or something they're hard to distinguish or you know potentially um with color blindness but um I've you know I've considered that for sure um as something I I do want to adjust um you know there are a lot of things I I definitely want to improve on in the app lots of things to the list I feel like your developers are always developing a b d a b d p always be developing p I'm so funny maybe maybe that's a good kind of wrap-up question um again as as the three developers here um because Kathy Kathy you've written code we've yep same definitely same dude got you writing some code I love it um one of the things that we we do bump into is the like I don't want to say scope creep or feature creep but it is the desire to either learn more apply what we've learned to do do something in the realm of let's oh I have this app here I could just and then now we know like 20 things happen and here we are and it's like oh we did all this stuff and here's here's how it is now and now it sucks and I don't want to use it anymore like we are biggest critics but we are also kind of like the biggest cause of maybe frustration um how do you prevent yourself from maybe scope creeping yourself or feature creeping yourself on this app or other apps that you have uh I think one way is just um really looking at what people are asking for uh in the app and you know what people really want out of it um it's tempting to build things that I want in the app and sometimes that aligns with what users want um but also I think another thing has just been looking at the app in the bigger picture and thinking about how I can spend time uh not developing the app and actually um trying to get it in front of more people and um you know hopefully grow the app because I think it really is um a way that I can make a positive impact on the world and um so it it makes me think that you know rather than putting um you know as many hours as I have in the past into developing the app I should really focus on um you know getting it out there more and um you know I also spend a lot of time you know if people email me um or you know they can actually send me an iMessage uh from the app for support or questions or feedback uh so I try to make a priority to talk to people that are using it I maybe this is why you're a successful app developer and I'm just a person that builds things for myself for fun because I'm immediately like you're like listening to my users what no like like they don't know what I want but thank you so much for um taking time are there are there any new letters of the alphabet that you plan on conquering um in the future I don't want to I don't want to spoil any any plans but I don't think so and the original name was not p um it was actually so uh it was p like p e e uh-huh and then ampersand c so like p and c and the idea was you you log your p's and then you see how hydrated you are um and uh I originally called it that um and uh people didn't want to use an app that had the word p in the name uh because it would come up on notifications it would show up under widgets it would show up you know under the app name and even though you can provide an alternate icon in ios um there isn't a way to change that name it's you know it's one name only for the app yeah and there's no way to dynamically let a user change that name um so uh it was my friend conrad actually who had that idea uh to change it to just the letter p um because it's a little more stealth and it's you know it can kind of be its own thing um I can't quite seem to get it to you know be number one for that when you just search the letter p in the app store yet but um it's just in there as p water app if anybody ever wants to search for it yeah I feel like the search though it doesn't I always have a problem where I will type one letter and it doesn't actually search it's like okay what else are you doing like you got to type other things and I'm like no that's literally the word that I like what are you talking about so yeah I can imagine that that's got to be slightly frustrating but I love it's so much fun it's such a fun idea and I it's just I love it we love whimsy whimsy is definitely you get bonus points from whimsy around here yes um so so no no new apps no nothing nothing new to just being awesome with the regular one hey I with the good app 100 on board with that thank you and I really appreciate you having me on I'm absolutely I'm also on board with uh the accountability thing that we do at the end of these topics but before we do that this episode of conduit is brought to you by claude from anthropic claude is a next generation ai assistant built by anthropic and trained
