From Relay FM, you're listening to Conduit. The show we Condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Condu with the show that I don't know it's it's due by Friday, especially when you're back to work, reconciling all your differences.
This episode is brought to you by all of the wonderful people who go to Relay.fm slash Conduit or as we have lovely hijacked a certain URL called give us your fricken money.com. That actually does work. Actually, it's freaking money. No, it's flipping money. Give us your flipping money.com.
I don't know, Kathy owns the domain go to Relay.fm slash Condu.com become a member today. You get access to the pre-impotial banner also a co-working session in the off weeks with myself and Kathy. But you hear me talking a lot. My guest has gone very quiet and that's because Kathy is not here.
She's doing St. Jude stuff, I believe. But with me for the first time ever in the almost decade that I've been recording and doing podcasts and I'm sure to no one's first time introduction. The one and only Marlon man. Hey, Marlon. No pressure. Hi, Jay. Thank you for having me on.
Marlon, I was going to ask you to introduce yourself and what do you do. But enough people know that about you. So I have a different question. Okay. How would I disagree? But how would three of your co hosts introduce you? Three of my co hosts introduce me. Oh, probably someone I enjoy having.
I speak in first person as one of my co hosts. Somebody I'm happy to have around because it makes me look smarter. I don't know. They're all different. They all, you know, it's like Anna Karenina. They're all broken in different ways. Here's a situation you don't want to be in in life.
You don't want me in a situation where the easiest person you have to work with is John Syracuse. Going somewhere very dark when that's the easiest person you do. I want to see what his like recording pre-like template looks like because I bet that's a that's a lot. He's got a lot of rules.
But anyways, yeah, thank you. I do podcast things I write things. I operate actively above and below many radars. And I just to get up every day and see how it goes. I don't know. I don't. I used to have grander things to say about myself. Now I feel like everything is so stupid.
This is the problem with parasocial relationships though because I'm. Yeah, because I sit here and I know that I have listened to you for years. And so I wasn't trying. I wasn't. I seem like I was fishing for compliments. That's not I didn't mean no, not at all.
It's it's a it's a hard to realize like this is the first time I'm talking to you though I've heard you several times though we have a very similar friend group like. It's not it's not you that I'm worried about Jay Jay.
If you and I got into some kind of a little like like you look like you grab me by the lapels and pulled me into some kind of a little alcove and we got to go skip three levels of of La Dida and and hat tipping. And we could straight into the real shit. I'd be super into it. It's just I.
I have learned to become more self conscious than I would like about how anything can be interpreted in the world. And I think we're at a point right now where people's interest in interpreting what people. Saying what they think they're saying has become really overwhelming to me.
I love what I do and I'll tell you okay you're right. Okay, you want to act like we're in the alcove now. Okay. Okay, so you grabbed me by the lapels and I didn't mind because it was consent. And now we're in the alcove we're skipping all that we're going straight to the real stuff.
I'm a writer who does podcasts and I'm fascinated by the unexpected connections between the things in our world. And how teasing out those connections and discovering the electricity between them can be a life affirming and very assertive way to conduct yourself in the modern world.
I love that you introduce yourself as a writer who does podcasts and not a podcast or who writes you see the distinction because if I say it the other people are going to go where's your book. But you know what you don't see you don't see 95% of the writing that I do because you don't need to.
Right. You know what we're saying like yeah.
Yeah, anyhow that's me and hi everybody I used to be Merlin man and and your boss probably has a name for something they do with email that has absolutely nothing to do with something I'm credited with inventing but I'm very happy to be here everybody I know loves Jay.
You're everybody's friend and so I'm thrilled to get to be here with you. I'm sorry I don't get to be yelled up I'm Mrs. unicorn soup but maybe on another day. Oh, I'll be back. Oh absolutely. I was told by the. Yes, telling people what they're doing wrong. Oh absolutely. I mean Jay.
Why do you hate Disney? Jay? Why do you always have to bring up sports references? Jay? Why are you doing this recording that way? It's always that's all I hear. It's always Jay. Why are you? Yeah, no, I understand. Yeah, yeah, nobody ever has house wall though.
Well, I got I got to stick to my notes here. The best part is. Yeah, I like this one. I like this one that says underscore a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a yeah. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. That is. Don't worry. I'm not gonna blow up your spot. No, that that's coming later.
So we talked about that that coworking session last week in our coworking session. I was sick. I had the flu. It wasn't great. No, um, so yeah, I got to be on bed rest hanging out in the Zoom chat while Kathy talked about keyboards. We actually talked about 3D printing.
Um, I think we're going to talk more about 3D printing later. Um, but if you want to, if you want to join that again, go to, oh, yeah, that's the other URL we have. I'm a super conductor dot com letter I letter M letter A super conductor dot com become a member.
Um, the really dot FM slash conduit slash join is that your URL. I think you can do that. Um, if people get wallpaper, they do get wallpaper. They get they get the bonus show. They get all that stuff.
They get the departures and the, um, I, I can never figure out what Kathy's other show that she does is called. So I just always call it something else. I'm going to call it trace back this week. They have a lot of nouns with a circle for an icon and I can keep up with all.
Well, I mean, the, the interesting thing is for conduit. It's, it's just a dad joke. It's the world's worst dad joke ever. It literally is the, um, I think it might be, I think it might be a pun. It, no, it's, we just believe it. You can do it. That's what that's why I called it upon.
Yeah, it's playing words. Wow. There was a, um, there was a motivational speaker and sales guy in the 70s named Zig Ziglar. Uh, my mother had his book and I read it many times because I was a lonely boy and he had a book called See with the top. I imagine it's still available.
And if you became a, an enthusiast of Zig Ziglar, uh, you can, you wouldn't seem to speak, especially. You could buy this thing and call it around to it. And it was a little wooden, wooden coin-ish thing that said, uh, it said to it. So you had around to it.
And that way you could say, you no longer have the excuse for saying I'm going to get around to it around. Now you have, you see how funny that is. There's a lot of drinking in the 70s, Jay.
I think a lot of being a salesperson in the 70s was about being able to seem like a high functioning alcoholic instead of just an alcoholic. And then you take people out and show them houses. That's how it was what we did from what I'm concerned in that like the story of millennials as well.
Um, which one is those? Uh, the millennials are the 30 year old ones. Are they the ones to use exclamation points and don't like, uh, don't like other punctuation? Is that millennials? Yeah, we use thumbs up and then we get, we wonder why our younger siblings get mad at us.
Oh, do you say stay safe? Is that you guys? Stay safe? Oh, like when, like when there's a tornado in Zaire. And then you say, you say, hey, you guys just watching what's happening. We definitely don't say you guys because they're, they're more than just guys here.
That's, that's, that's definitely we're that group. We're that group that will yell at you every time you throw guys. I see. I feel like that's something that people still, yeah, I know Jeff Jeff Probe stopped saying it. Um, they got, they got probed that can get anybody.
I said folks in y'all, I'm following the cyclone. I just want to say stay safe. Oh, you know, thanks Zaire. Thanks you. We were going to walk straight into the deadly cyclone. But then a wine mom sent us a note with an emoji that said stay safe. So safe. We shall stay. Yeah, you do your show.
I'm just going to hang out here. You talk. Oh, I like this. Well, no, it's time for the connection check. So, uh, boo, boo, boo. Yeah. Well, that's actually, yes. I feel that's, so we used to, we used to do a zap. And it used to be like the most heartfelt zap you've ever had in your life.
Um, Kathy stopped me after team. And then, um, then we automated the zap. And then we just kind of got rid of it. Um, that's smart. So my connection check from the last episode was to do a trip report, because I had to go to Jacksonville. You know, Jackson, you remind this. Listen, I do.
Can you remind this listener what you're talking about? Connection checks. These are the things that we assigned ourselves from the last two weeks. Oh, yeah. We're going to get done. Um, the best part of this trip report for me was I immediately did it after the show.
Um, but the important part was I got $500 back from doing that trip report. And that's $500. I got back. So like, why am I, you know, of course I'm going to do it. Um, but I remember to do it.
Hey, Marlon, did you do anything of a note interest or whimsy? What did you learn? Where did you learn from that? Uh, I learned that, hey, if you just tell yourself you're going to do it and then followed by immediately doing it, you don't have to think about it for two weeks.
Did it feel any different than other times? It actually did. And that was, that was kind of the, that was, that was the pain point though. No, the reason, the reason this whole trip report thing was like, normally I just do it, but I had to use Uber. I had to use Uber for the first time in a while.
Normally I use lift and I use lift purely because I can export all of my trips and put in a request for one versus doing each of them one piece one. Yeah. Uber doesn't allow that anymore unless you want like the ugliest CSV file, which again on any other day, I'm all about it.
Oh, you can go get this. Yeah, exactly. Use that Fs, SFDC and just just get all of in there. But when you still want SFDC, yeah, I'm on LADC. Oh, man. LADC. Much further south. Yeah, you have the time zone problem though with that though.
 I have so many problems, Jay, I can't even begin to tell you, but that must have felt and so, but the here's the beauty part is it wasn't a poor thing you procrastinated a long time and then did it was something you realized you had me at procrastinated could to cook you took right right off the bat.
You went and you did it. It wasn't difficult. You didn't die. Yeah, and on top of that, it actually gave me time to do my real job, which is being a manager, which I'm still coming to care for. Imagine that. Yeah. Cause that's new. That's the thing for me.
I don't, I don't know how I'm doing, but my team says it's well. I'm trying to think of stuff. You know, I think sometimes, gosh, I'm sorry. If you ever have me back on and I wouldn't, but if you ever have me back on, I'll be better prepared for how to do the show. I've a lot of this stuff.
I'm, I'm very rarely particularly proud of something I've done, but I can tell you that if I am proud of it, it is almost uniformly something that would be difficult to explain to someone else or the import of which would seem much less significant to someone else.
And, and that's maybe why I haven't sat down and tried to do this because even if I figured out two or three candidates for what I've done in the last two weeks, the describing of them would be tedious. And I, but I think there's something to learn from that.
Oh, you're going to have something that you're going to have a horrible time reading the conductor's connections then because they are very much that. Well, I can roll any direction, but what I'm, what I'm, yeah, I'll follow anything and I can, of course, I can always make things up. I'm a man.
But, but the a lot of times I feel some quiet, not pleasure, but satisfaction with myself.
If I manage to not do something that I was trying not to do or it's not even just like, I don't see that I'm like, I didn't found myself, you know, obsessing less over something or I bought it a lot of, but like sometimes.
There's a, there's a, there's a wonderful joke that I can't tell in its original form, but I'll tell it in a close enough form. So, you know, when I was coming up in Cincinnati, Ohio, we wouldn't tell ethnic jokes because we were from Ohio and we wouldn't do things like that.
So, we were allowed to tell dumb Charlie jokes. Now, here's the thing. Dumb Charlie is a stand-in in the 1970s for an entire country in Europe who used to be the butt of jokes and it wasn't particularly funny, but that was, that was a kind of joke.
So, there's a dumb Charlie joke where a guy walks into a room and dumb Charlie is holding two hands overflowing with horse poop. And Charlie says to everybody, hey everybody, look what I almost stepped in. And I feel like that's a lot of the world right now.
I feel like the world is squeezing very tightly around some freshly minted horse crap, holding it up in front of them and in the most, you know, inside or intelligent, plugged into the discourse way going, look what I almost stepped in.
And it's separate issue whether that's the most, you know, whole something to do in the world. But on the other hand, there is something to be learned, you know, the real ninja move in that is to never pick up the horse crap but to just quietly walk around it.
Which doesn't score you a ton of points on Instagram, I assume. But sometimes if I've managed to avoid the kinds of situations that tend to make my life less good, I do feel just like quietly acknowledged, hey you got that one tighter.
 You know, sometimes it involves like, you know, avoiding an unnecessary, you know, argument with somebody not falling a lot of my thinking right now for better for worse is around that sort of look what I almost stepped in issue just the acrimony, the way that people treat each other, the way that the so whatever only ways of finding community anymore is to find something we can briefly be angry about together.
Yeah, I think rationally well, I'd love to talk about that because I've got about 40 lines on it right here. That that's what but in so doing but then I also don't benefit from then saying asking people to throw me a party because I wasn't a jerk.
But that's why I say some of my favorite stuff is this stuff that's either difficult to explain or not that interesting, but like in my journey to become less of a total homemade piece of crap.
I'm I'll notice sometimes when I was able to avoid an unnecessary bit of acrimony or or just a lot letting myself be dragged into the latest round of community negativity because that so rarely leads me someplace I'm very enthused about it doesn't feel a particularly creative direction.
It kind of feels like you know we're all just kind of huddling around the the great you know camping out on the street hoping that we make it another night and so we you know anyways look what I almost stepped in is what I'm saying.
No, I like that and I mean I've talked about this on the show a little bit of just like me completely getting it's not getting off social media for anything. I'm not I'm not trying to make a stance. I'm not trying to do any of that stuff. Right right right right. My blog.
We're so mobbed up with social media that it seems like we're supposed to make a statement about quitting social media. Yeah, it's bananas. Yeah. I can't just go out there and be a person without it being part of a larger arm to both project you have to share with people.
Well, no, because that's my job is often share things I do with people but talking to you is talking listeners. Oh, yeah, that's again, I assume that no one is listening to this. I'm going to draw on the wallpaper. I'm taking away the wallpaper for one week.
You get your wallpaper when you show me that you know how to use it responsibly. Do a connection and then you get wallpaper. That's what we get. Speaking of people who did connections, let's let's let's burn through these. Just go to the music for this. No, unfortunately.
Our tech podcast listener of the show, Pillix says connection check green square. I did a teeny bit of work on the mod. Good job, Pillix. Do you want to do the next one? What? What in the hell are you talking about? I'm not looking at this. I'm not. I thought it was a guest in my co-host.
You can be. Yeah, usually we have designated co-hosts. Oh, we're going to change a lot. Wait, we're stopped right now. We're retooling a whole bunch of this. Oh, let's go. Now, let me pull down here. I'm going down. I'm clicking. Oh, I see. Oh, so some of these are real.
They're not all just blah, blah text. Yeah. So we're out. I'm going to just try and I know I see your pink. Okay. Here I go. Okay. This is from, oh, this is our soprano of the show. We call it.
The connection check is decided against a post-easter mini trip after I realized that right after Easter is Patriots Day, the Boston Marathon and School Vacation Week in New England, and traveling can be pretty annoying because of that.
Instead, we are planning to try out some new to us restaurants. Our fish pair of the show, Fishy Guys said connection check, green circle. I didn't do J's patented minimum workout. I don't remember what that is. I think it's get up, like walk to the bathroom and walk back to bed.
But I did join a gym. I actually went a few times and exercise while I was there. Good job. Okay. Robotics engineer of the show. Am I having an event? I feel like I feel like these might be some good. Is this a test? Is this a neurological exam? This is like better than what I expected.
So it's great. No, it's great. Connolly check, green circle. What? So this is robotics engineer of the show, Aiden. Right. So you can take a connection check, green square, blue automobile. The new mechanic was, the new mechanic was much more, just not an ounce of context in there.
The new mechanic was much more reasonably priced. So I got them to do most of the work. Plus, I got them to put on my summer tires as well. Did we then have a weekend long ice storm? Yes. But it's not like I drove then anyway, so it's fine. Thank you, Aiden. Yeah.
The context is Aiden got, needs to take his card of the mechanic. And then he did. And then he said he was going to go to another mechanic to which I said, don't be procrastinating about. Is this part of the work session? No, this was, it'll make sense.
It'll make sense when we get to the end of the show. And then we're going to read a similar table where they talk about what they're going to do in the next two weeks. If this is entrapment, you have to tell me. No, no, no, you don't have to show up and don't worry. I'm not a cop. We didn't miss.
We smell anything because I'll do it. We miss someone. We miss the awe of the show. The awe of the show. It says connect the check. I thought that was a placeholder because you got all these eyes in there. No, that's actually their name. Is that a real thing? Yes.
I thought that was you doing blah blah information like testing Json results. What are you doing here? Yeah, the show. Sorry. Sorry. I screwed that up. Yeah. Red telephone. Okay. Connection check. Red telephone. Yeah. I did not make the phone call. The procrastination grim then got me again.
Oh, man. That's okay. Next time. We do the nameless of the show. Oh, my God. The nameless of the show. Thank you. The nameless connection. Connection check calling. Green circle calls made appointments book. Yay. Adulting. Nameless is one of our people who's listening live as well. Hi, nameless.
And just to shout out nameless. Nameless is like done way too many things. But on top of that, get his master's degree like. Wow. That's cool. Through this, this show. Life is hard. Life is hard. Nameless. Hang in there. Akuna Matata. Our identical to one of the show Aaron says. Green circle.
Pervacation ideas. I did start talking about. Dr. Grinna. That's actually where this idea kind of came from. Was like. Too early calling show like a type of a nation type. Oh, that would be awesome. I'd be totally into that. I wanted to be an NPR radio host growing up. Oh, my God.
I did race war as do something because I don't know what happened. I would love to hear a lot more race war as that guy is so good at what he does. He was great on talking the nation. And then what else was he great in? He was great in a documentary I watched recently. Oh, he's great in the.
Akuna Ken Burns's brother Rick has a wonderful documentary series on New York with a wonderful episode about Robert Moses. Race war is his great in that. Sorry. Name check and race war as big fan. I like it. But yeah, this is this was meant to be like the call in portion of the show. Yeah.
So yeah, our identical twin of the show Aaron says. I don't know if I call it in my day was. Perfect. I love it. I started putting a list together for some high level ideas. I was hoping to do more with that, but also I did book a camping trip for August. Good job, Aaron.
You want to get the last one? Sure. Carle of all trades of the show. Carl says. I'm going to check out the connection check. Colin green check ish. I am ready to run the coding contest on Thursday.
There are more I could have done to there's more I could have done to prepare, but they are nice to have things. You got nice to have things not necessary things. Yeah, I couldn't read that as well. I probably put that poorly. I'm sorry. Thank you, Carl. And congratulations.
I'm being told that I missed one. I'm going to have to go to the next one. I'm going to have to go to the next one. I'm going to have to go to the next one. I'm going to have to go to the next one. I'm going to have to go to the next one. I'm going to have to go to the next one.
I'm going to have to go to the next one. I'm going to have to go to the next one. I'm going to have to go to the next one. I'm going to have to go to the next one. I'm going to have to go to the next one. I'm going to have to go to the next one. I'm going to have to go to the next one.
I'm going to have to go to the next one. And I'm using it exclusively for 13 days. Now supplementing with tick tick because I need a simpler day to day taskless but still likening notion for overall planning and making sure nothing is falling through the cracks.
You said a lot of buzzwords and it's not even like a... I'm trying to find the right fit for some kind of a tool that supports the stuff you want to do with data management. Is that the idea? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Awesome. Well, we don't have a sponsor. So I'm not bitter at all.
But, you know, it's fine. People who normally sponsor our show, sponsor the show. You know how I treat you well. So make it happen. Should we make one up? You want to make one up or just... Let's say this episode is brought to you by Dubai Friday. Dubai Friday show. Oh, no, no, no. Come on, no, no.
Dubai Friday is the show that you thought you were going to listen to because they meet weekly and they give each other tasks to do. Isn't there one that we could both like that's not one of ours? Over time, you watched that lesson. I watched that lesson. I don't watch TV. So, Dubai Friday.
I think it's the Dubai Friday for supporting conduit. Ah! Yeah, that works. No, that was also a shout out to Ah! Well, that means... It's getting a lot of stuff. Is this... The real talk, Jay, is this what it's like to listen to one of my podcasts? Because I bet it kind of is. Yeah, actually. Okay.
All right, cool. Cool. So there's a lot of layers of signification. Yeah, there's a lot of... There's a lot of... A lot of systems, a lot of lore. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I mean, we have entire... I think you saw on the doc. We have an entire like productivity system we created. That's cool. Yeah.
I mean, it's not working. You know, honestly, it works really well. It's called the tire method. It's when someone asks you to do something you say, no, I'm too tired. Oh, okay. That's pretty good. But tired is actually an acronym. It's time intuition, resources, and energy.
So either I don't have the time for it. I think it stands for tire is really excellent. Oh, that's good. That's good. That's merch right there. I'm glad we got that. So is that all... Are there other conductors' connections? We need to address anything else.
Hey, in the time we've been talking, have we had any other calls? Nope. That's it for now. On to the main thing, which was something that you brought up in our free show. Yes. Well, it's two things. I don't understand what's happening. It's two things that happened.
One was a thing that you were talking about on another show that you did called Over Tired, where you were... You were in the process of talking about a mental health check. And then you said that you were kind of thinking of it more of an emotional health check.
I wanted to actually look at that from an emotional product productive kind of lens. I think that, again, we talk a lot about the things that we do.
We actually have been on this kick lately, where Kathy has been fighting a little bit of stress, burn out and things, but also adding things to the plate that are supposed to be joyous occasions, but maybe not so much. Yeah, that's one topic.
The other topic was earlier you asked me about one thing that I do and how that impacts other things that I do. And the thing that I wanted to say, but I knew it would take another 45 minutes of us going through it, was, yes, however I do so dang much, that it becomes a muddy mess of just anxiety.
So, forgive me. Number one I wrote down here is emotional health. The second one, what was the context for us talking about that? We were talking about... You're doing one thing to do another thing. I'm sorry, I missed that. I was preparing...
I was talking about how I structured data and stuff, and you said, oh, how does that impact you and other things that you do? Right. And then we started really going hard on like three printing, but... Oh, yeah, yeah, and the whole learning from what you learn. Yeah, that's a lot of stuff.
Which one sounds better for you and we'll save the other one for the... Whatever your listeners would enjoy. I'm happy to go anywhere. Let's do the second one only because I feel like I can actually keep up with you on that one. The emotional productivity thing is like... I don't know. Oh, no.
Jay, I'm nothing to keep up with. Dear me, I'll say that. No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry I'm how I am. You know, I've been like this forever. I'll be with you any other way. Hmm. Hmm. I'm not sure I believe that. And so what is the name of this topic? Learning to learn. I mean, lessons from lessons.
A dancing to learning. Adapting to adapt. I don't know. Like I don't know. Usually we just call it... What part of the show? Was that part of the show? People were here. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, okay. Usually we just have like bracket bracket, topic bracket bracket, and then we just go from there.
But to be honest, like the idea of taking like the things I'm learning from one area and applying them into another thing. Right, right, right, right. That is a thing that I'm thinking about a lot lately, specifically because I'm giving a talk about it next week in Austin.
And it's called a community manager's guide to package management, or a package manager's guide to community management. I don't think you know this, but I run a nonprofit called Black Python Devs. It's a nonprofit for Black Python developers around the world.
We just hit like a thousand members in our discord. We raised $30,000 last year to help put on Python conferences, meetups, user groups across the US, Africa, parts of South America. And I am the founder and I did it because everyone told me that it would be too hard to do.
I also created my own static site generator. So I use Markdown and Front Matter and all that stuff. And now I have people in parts of Africa and the US and other places helping me maintain that.
And I just created a new open source project called Front Matter Check that is literally just a limter for Front Matter because that doesn't exist and that's not one google account today I'll put it in the Air Octane project which hopefully is a good focus team. We're soon here in Alexa's desert.
We could aussi here in addition to what the growth system has been doing so far. collecting data for you. So, the data being Marchae which is a planned transition my data's been done currently.
 I don't think it's precisely important of your life, I genuinely feel like if I tried to stop and document all of those things as I'm 30, 40 slides into a presentation that I have to give, I feel anxious because I don't think of it as I was doing this so I was like, okay, I'm a little bit lost in the weeds.
So you've got a presentation coming up that's related to the Python thing that you do and who's the presentation to and what's it for? It's a Python conference, it's for PyTex. What does that mean? It comes to a Python conference. People who use Python programming language. Okay, so. That's it.
And then live in a row, you get a general kind of conference. Okay. Oh, it's like a user group.
 It's like they're one big gathering that they do where there'll be several hundred of them versus like, And then your thing is you're gonna get up there and like you have a point of view for doing stuff with Python that would be useful to these people and you're gonna pitch them on like a big idea related to that.
Yes. Okay. What's the big idea? Well, the big idea is that the two things of like creating Python packages and creating Python communities are really just one in the same, the same skill set and in fact, it's hard to have, I bet it's hard to have at least one of those without the other.
I don't know if they're equal. Like it seems to me like the package part. I think I'm just like Docker-ish things. Yeah.
So yeah, but like if you're gonna have this thing that's all just this wrapped up, you know, a bunch of components of things, there's probably not that many projects that you would even want one person to do on their own requires a community, right?
Are you familiar with either grid finity or multi-board? So similar to that.
Like a Python package would basically be like the grid finity system. Hey, I've created this thing to use. That's standard. Yeah, it's like a standard. It's a standard way of implementing a thing. Like, Vrinder Engine for me is a standard way that I can create websites. So that's what I do.
So you do wanna have this idea of building a community around that, but you also have this idea of like, I'm afraid to build community because people scary, or I'm afraid to be a package manager, because that's not just 3D printing.
That is developing a system in which other people can use that will like radically change how they 3D work. People are gonna rely on what you make. Yeah, yeah.
But on top of that, that also plays in well with my job as being a part of developer relations, where Brett and I do the same thing, Asterisk, Brett's rules kinda got weird. But, I've just got a new boss. Yeah, I heard about that. Thanks.
But the challenge for me is often, I have to go into communities in which I'm often not a part of, and I have to assimilate. I have to come in and belong. I have to understand how they operate, how they communicate, how they move, and then I have to contribute.
And I get paid to do that, which is great. I love that part of my job. The downside is that everyone thinks that, everyone thinks that you build multi-board the same way you build gridfinity, and that's just not true.
And everyone thinks that just because you built gridfinity one time means that you could build something else with relative ease and just repeat the steps, and also not true.
And I think about this a little bit for you, because I know you've done things in the past, and a lot of people will often go, well, you just do thing again. And it's like, that's not how it works.
I learned from the first thing I did in doing thing again, but I'm not really going to just do it again. Why would I do it again? So this is what was the question having to do with your presentation? No, it's more just a kind of an open conversation piece for you. Yeah.
Gosh, well, I would find that very daunting, because the community part of it would be, not because I dislike people, but because, well, all the usual reasons, like I think I misunderstood a lot of what it means to, I don't even love that term, manage.
But to be a person who's a, even just an organizer inside of a group, that takes a really special set of skills.
 I've been hearing a long time ago, speaking again of salespeople, that, you know, well, you know, how are you running the thing where there are people who are great practitioners, that may not be such great managers, and you've got other people who are really, especially good, they can manage or sell anything.
And I know there's a lot of gradations to all those sorts of things, but it seems like, so is the thrust, as I say, the takeaway of this talk is going to be, is that there's a recommendation for how to conduct this that pays honor to the community part and to the packages part.
Like, what is it? Where do you think that's going in terms of what you'll say? I think the, kind of the big takeaway here is kind of what you said, like, regardless of if you're doing A or B, it's hard.
And there is no lack of understanding in that, or there is no lack of empathy in the like, I know that you're doing the hard thing.
 And then there are some very practical like tips that I have just learned from doing this for so many years now of, you know, obviously, you want to shout to the world, but you probably don't want to shout to the world on 17 different social media sites because one that's going to be very bad for your mental health, but then to like, you've got to manage all of that stuff.
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, geez, I, hmm, I'm not sure how much I have to, it sounds like you've got a good approach for it. I think, I need to say something smart at this point.
 I think sometimes if I, if I were going to try and analyze stuff I missed that I could have caught earlier in life, one of those things would be that, well, this is a little bit of a cliche, but it's an instrumental cliche for me, which is that I don't mean make a strong man out of this, but I think management, a manager is different from a boss is different from a mentor, is different from a coordinator, is different from like, those have different kinds of connotations and not just that like a boss is what you'd call somebody on like, I love Lucy and like a coordinator or something, you know, you'd call somebody at an asked session in Marin or something, but really much more to this idea though of like, well, the job or the challenge, the situation, whatever it is that causes us to need or want to collaborate with other people that varies so much from person to person, but one thing that tends not to change is that is how motivation is so different for different people.
When we say motivation, I feel like that has a slight connotation of, you know, on the one hand, it sounds a little like talking about motivational speech and like how do you get your sales numbers up and like second prize of steak knives and that kind of stuff?
And I don't necessarily mean it that way.
I mean, there's deeper motivations to why we choose to bother or not. Like how much we choose to show up for something. And so there are motivations that are, I think, less difficult to understand.
Like, hey, I've got a deadline and this needs to get done or, you know, again, I've committed to something and that needs to happen, but even if it's not that dire, I think a mature member of a team goes, hey, I know there's stuff I'm not great at.
And not only are there other people who are good at it but who enjoy doing that, you know, I'm not just gonna hand them all this literal and emotional labor. Like that's how we, that's how, you know, you don't need six cyclopses on your X-Men.
Like you gotta have a different set up of X-Day of different kinds of people. That's what makes the team interesting. That's what makes the dream.
But that's, I think one thing that's so ineffable and when we try to like go guns blazing and charging into how to be a good manager about something, is that, you know, there's a certain cany-ness about what makes people wanna do something, let alone do it well, that can be very elusive.
And I know it's elusive for me, but it strikes me that, you know, when we say, are we talking about community, we're talking about team, what we're talking about here.
 Like if this is not everybody thinks this is a good idea and we just need to align the direction that we're walking and that's one kind of thing, I bet there's unique challenges to what you're trying to do that vary even as your group grows or as the cultural diversity, the heterogeneity of the people who are contributing, one of the people who is stuck in that terrible cyclone, you know, down in another country.
Like they're participating. It must be difficult to, as that evolves, to understand how to harness and best utilize people's motivations for things. I like that. I'm motivation, you got nothing. I like that.
And I have a specific question for you then, because I think that this is something that I've just noticed just over the time that I've been listening to some of your shows. You, I mean, for good reason, you don't do, in my opinion, any two shows that are the same.
They might have similar similarities amongst them, two people usually talking, you know, just backing forth, kind of while loose with it, less of a plan, kind of a plan, but we'll get there when we get there.
But every show hits a different part of, I would say like the complete idea of what, of who, not even who Merlin is, but who Merlin allows people to perceive in the public eye, because when I look at like a back to work or I look at it like California King versus... Oh my God, you know about it.
Thank you. Oh my God, I'm so happy that you know that show. Thank you. And then like those in comparison to do by Friday in comparison to...
For example, like a talk I did, talks I did 10 years ago that could, you know, sort of go in the scale of the different amounts of mania on my part to like becoming kind of actually sort of heavy sometimes, right? But imagine if someone listened to just one of those podcasts and said, I have a...
I feel fortunate they listened to just one. Well, but if they said, I have a complete knowledge of who Merlin is based off of... You do. Friday. Like, like that's the pain that I get when I try to, when I try to look at like, how do I bring, I don't wanna say bring my whole self into the thing.
Yeah, I get it. But how do I... It's not like your whole self doesn't belong everywhere. Exactly, but how do I also create a realistic picture of here's the best way to work with me. Here's the best way to communicate. Here's the best way to... Here's what to expect from this.
But more importantly, here is the wall that you're not seeing that you can't see over, that you can't get around. Like, here's the boundary in this, you know, quote unquote, parasocial relationship that we have that I need people to respect.
Cause I mean, this is an active thing that is happening now where I have podcast people who are in the Python community and they see what I do in the Python community and they wonder why I don't talk about that stuff on conduit and I go, because... Oh, right.
Cause fewer people would listen and half of those people don't care, but then at the same time... No, no, I think I see what you're talking about.
Yeah, it's, there's, there's, there really, I think with relatively few examples and certainly very few examples that most of us could try to emulate, you can't be everything to everybody all the time. And you need your central product.
Yes, your product, like what, what? Like, whether or not you're building a community, you're building a package. Like, we have this desire to, if I'm gonna do this show, you know, I put on this performance. I am Jay, the person who is on conduit.
The person that hates Disney with a fiery passion, the only good thing to ever come out of it was an Emperor's New Groove and the nightmare before Christmas. And I guess technically Toy Story, now that that's been retconned. But like, there's, some of that is a bit.
And some of that I need, like, it's, it's based in reality and it's based in trueness. But also, I don't want to be like hanging out with my kid at a baseball game and someone go, oh, you're Jay Miller. Oh, you love baseball, but you hate Disney.
Let's talk about why you hate Disney for five minutes while my daughter's like, what the hell, like, yeah. What's going on? Daddy, why is this weird person talking about why you hate Elsa so much? Like, I'm, yeah, right. You know, I do.
I think it sounds like one thing you're, I don't completely follow, but I think it sounds like part of what you're saying is, I mean, there's a word that I, like, that I aspire to.
It sounds like you're talking to someone's about integrity where it's, there's, you know, there's, when you are doing stuff in front of other people, which is now something a lot of us do all the time, you know, whether that's on Instagram or to talk or whatever.
Like, I got, okay, here's my short version. My short answer to that, and again, I don't, I'm a little bit lost, but I think I understand what you're saying, because, you know, what women, right? Like, you know, do I contradict myself? I contain multitudes, you know, that kind of idea.
I think sometimes a way to think of it is, if we wanted to be somewhat, you culturally mercantile about it to, to make a point or to, and I'm not just trying to make this about presentations, but whether or not you realize, as long as we realize, we have something to say about something.
Boy, that's real helpful, Merlin. Yeah, but like sometimes like, when, when, like, I realized, I didn't even realize until we started talking that there's two or three things that I really do want to say somewhere, maybe not here, but I was visiting a little bit.
When we both were here early, does have me thinking, as I'm sitting here right now, I'm just going to say this. So just because I'm confused by a lot of what you're saying this show, and this is one part I can handle, and so just give me a sec here.
I realized that there's a lot of stuff I feel more stronger than I realized, and things, I realized that there's things where like I started to write a little bit of a snippet about something, again, see also, all that writing is happening, whether or not it's published.
It's the point is the point is the process.
 It's not the product, but I've got these little bits of things I want to talk about, like how the role of anger and helplessness in creating modern contemporary community, thinking about the parts of ourselves that we reserve for ourselves and withhold, I think that's kind of related to what you're talking about.
 I don't mean to turn this into a tip and trick thing, but I think one way is to think about, well, whether it is your presentation on behalf of your very cool sounding group to talk about Python packages, whether it is trying to talk to one listener on this show, who might be having a particularly bad 10-day spell, you know?
Sometimes we don't even realize we have a point.
There may be a point. I happen to feel that people who start out thinking they have a big point and then just keep saying the same point over and over, tend not to be the people I find the most interesting. I like watching or listening to people figure it out in front of me.
It pleases me much to do that, but you can't figure everything about everything now at the same time, in front of everybody, all the time, and expect it to go over well.
 And so I think one way to think about it, if you wanted to think, and that's why I say sort of culturally mercantile, you know, I don't think about it this way, but if I were going to go out and try to teach some seminar on effective presentations, you know, there's all kinds of things I could say to a stranger about presentations, you know, good rule of thumb, have a big one big point and three sub points, have one question and three answers, have one statement and three supports, you know, 45 minutes getting it out, there's all kinds of things like that.
But there's also this idea of like, well, what can I bring of myself to this? And what are the parts of me that probably not just for convenience or for some kind of vaguely hypocritical reason, are the parts of me that are not really well suited to where I am right now?
And would in fact take away from the point that I'm trying to make.
And I think that's part of being an effective speaker, right? We may not love to see every time some kind of politician gets up there and seems genial, but like, boy, do you have any idea how hard it is to try and not be hated by everybody at the same time?
And so you have to say these kinds of reversion to the mean type things.
I think there's a place there ought to be for fortunate. There'll be a place for us in the work that we do. I think it's just advisable to figure out what I'm thinking of golf clubs. That's a terrible example.
But something where you've got our toolbox, for example, like you've got to figure out what tool works best in this situation. And that might be something where I don't know what that room looks like when you go and do your presentation.
But like if you think about the different kinds of the vibe in the room, what is the, what's the makeup of the room? Has the, has the setup of the chairs changed since you were there earlier? How does all that feed into what parts of you are going to come out, even like a plan presentation?
And I think there's a kind of artfulness to that.
But with that said, all of that still exists independently and separately. Mostly from who we are in our day to day, where that's a lot more challenging. And requires a lot more stuff where you don't bring out the whole Swiss Army knife every single time you open the toolbox. I like that.
Which which part? Specifically, figuring out which part of you to bring to the making the point. Yes. That makes sense. It makes sense to me. I think there is this show in itself.
By the way, this is like, I think you notice this like episode like Kathy and I have been doing the show every other week, like for a few years. And there has, there's been a lot of change.
Just how the shows progress, how we've progressed as human beings, like, like, you know, kids are growing up and stuff and then all those things. If you're lucky. Yes. And I have this, this constant desire.
And I think that there may be others around you that have it as well that are, are very much of people enjoy me. The more people enjoy the more that I bring myself to the picture, that's awesome. But I think that that comes at a cost.
And funny enough, like when we pitched this show to the Beards, Mike was like, I love how real and personal and emotional it is. And then Steven was like, be careful with that.
 Just as they like not, not saying someone's going to like start stalking you, but like the, the emotional labor that comes from doing things that you like and wanting to bring your whole self to them, kind of bringing it back to the initial thing of like, I do a thing one way and how does that impact other things that I do.
Wanting to do that intentionally, whether it's, you know, I write databases this way. So this is how I do the databases over here. Or I use my notebook here because I love how textile notebooks are even though, yeah, yeah.
Like you've got, you've got, you've got, even if you don't know a reason, you, if somebody pressed you on it, you might be able to find a reason.
But the example I used to use back in the day with the old butcher, like somebody who's worked in the same butcher shop for 40 years and just knows what a pound of roast beef weighs without needing to look at the scale. It's no indictment against scales.
It's no indictment against having less expertise. What it's an indictment against is thinking that you can, you can like, just if you try real hard for like a Liberty weekend, you can become as experienced as something as somebody who's done it for 40 years. Well, the process is what it's about.
You know, I love, as I, more of my friends get older and become a little more reflective about it, I think more of us are open to the idea that the process is the process, the process of what we do, the process is the writing, the process is the music.
It's not something that we, we suffer through to get to it. But no, eventually you embrace the process, whatever the process is. It's just that it's not the kind of thing you can just put up on a white board and have people understand and, and grok with time for coffee and cookies after.
Can I, can I read you a quote from my slides? This is your show. You can do anything. I'm just glad I'm here. Thank you. This is a quote from the multi board community, funny enough. And they were talking about, Hey, multi board, the thing that's like creativity.
Multi board is the, is this the hexagon one? Yes. It's the hexagon one that you hang up on the wall and stuff. And I, I actually, you're listeners know what that means. It doesn't matter. It's a community of 3D printing, notary. That's all the context you need there.
This quote, this quote says it's from, from Justin. Hey, Justin, Justin, thanks. First, I want to thank you for this update. And this update was coming from them saying, Hey, look, we haven't, we haven't talked about what we're doing in a while.
Like we've just, we've just been like letting things happen. This was like a couple of weeks ago. So I want to thank you for this update, seeing things so quiet and static for the past several months has gotten me nervous at times.
If I should be investing my efforts into this ecosystem, as, as I read that, like a part of me, like, almost wanted to cry because there is like this Kathy and I come in, we do this show. And sometimes it is literally the best thing that came out of that week for us.
But it was just another Tuesday for everyone else. There was nothing new to talk about, nothing great that happened. Doing, doing, you know, Python stuff, all I did was bump versions. All I did was say, go from version 2.3 to 2.4. That's the only work that I could muster to put in that week.
And there's a level of everybody only gets to see that one little piece. But what I'm doing is I'm cutting piece after piece after piece, doing little by little by little in so many areas. And that it leaves me in many ways unfulfilled.
And it leaves other people who are dependent on the things that I'm creating or just want to enjoy the things that I'm creating. It leaves them unsatisfied. And that is, that is a place that I'm struggling a little bit. You're concerned here about like you're doing your best.
Maybe you don't know if you hit it out of the park, but you're worried that you're disappointing people. Is that it? I'm worried that eventually things get stale. I'm worried that eventually, you know, exciting. Everything is exciting until it's not the first 3D print you make.
You know, your first booty, your first benchy is great. The fifth booty and benchy, you're just like, okay, I did, I did the thing. 100 episodes in it, conduit, you know, four years of doing this show. It's still exciting for me. It's still great. And I still love it. And I still do it.
But there's always that inkling of a thought that, you know, someone is writing. I want to thank you for this episode. Seeing things not change or be static for the past several months has made me nervous about should I be investing my efforts into this? Yeah. So, um, okay.
So are you, are you, are you, are you involved in the hexagon community? I mean, I've printed out stuff. That's really it. I just got an email on a song. What are you reading me? What were you reading? Just now, what is that, what is that from and about? That was from their forum.
And that was just due to the lack of updates. But okay. Okay. So in that case, that's somebody who is saying, um, okay. So this is a community we all like the thing we're doing. Um, and that person is saying that their concern is that there hasn't been enough activity.
And so they're worried whether it's still a going concern. Yeah. Okay. Or things haven't changed. You haven't, you haven't developed any new pieces to this.
What is, what does that mean to you when someone says, something like that? It, it means, and in some ways, it means that I'm, I'm either boring them, um, or that, okay. So you are involved in the making hexagon. Sorry. Sorry. No.
If, if someone said that to me about something that I was making, I would feel, oh, I see. I would, yeah. I would feel a little, a little beat up by that. Yeah. Sure. Sure. Yeah.
This was just something that as I read, I was reading it as I was reflecting on, hey, I've been doing a thing for four years now. Yeah. I feel you, man. I've been doing this, you know, I've been programming for over a decade. I've been, you know, doing all these things. You got it.
You got it going on, man. Well, it's not even a, you got it going on. It's a, you've done a lot. And now you're slowing down or the peers is if you're slowing down. And a lot of that is like, yeah, I'm not. When you control that, you control that.
Well, I mean, you could, but who'd want to? I mean, I don't know. Yeah, I got it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's complicated. And you know, sometimes the, the soul has to be self satisfying. It's really difficult.
For some reason, I heard, I forget where I heard this probably on a documentary, that I don't know if this is true, but whether or not it's true, it's a good story.
Supposedly, latent is career, Ted Williams shows up in the stadium and he hears, I've heard this in this story told in different ways about different domains, not just baseball.
But supposedly Ted Williams hears somebody doing batting practice and he instantly knows there's something special about that person just from how it sounds when he hits the ball. And it was Hank Aaron. It turned out to be true.
Sometimes we know, well, sometimes you know before the ball crosses the plate. Sometimes you know you've blown it usually. But sometimes you know, oh man, I can tell I think there's a good chance I'm really going to get a piece of this.
I might get a little too far down toward my hands and foul out. But like there's something that tells me from the number of times I've had a ball pitched at me and I've hit it that I have a pretty good idea before crosses the plate. And you could be right wrong.
Who knows? But isn't this part of becoming a professional baseball player is developing these kinds of things. And just that idea of Ted Williams, I bet you Hank Aaron knew pretty well when he hit it.
Right under the H and B, he probably had a pretty good idea if that thing was going to be going yard or not. Ted Williams has enough experience to know from the sound of it if Hank nailed it. Now, you know, Hank, like I say, Hank was good for a long time from early on.
And he probably knew sometimes you know, even if you haven't hit it out of the park yet, you know, when you're, you've really made good contact with it. Not all of us have a Ted Williams to hear that. And sometimes that can be a bit of a bummer.
And then you find yourself saying things like, I've had this thing. I've been struggling with for 25 years. And I finally, I think I found a handle for it this week. And nobody gave me an out of boy, right? Yeah. I mean, let's say words.
Isn't that kind of what you're talking about is like, you don't, I mean like it's, and you, but then on, you know, you don't, you don't want to disappoint people. But like also sometimes the most, the stuff that I'm most excited is about this, is the stuff that is the freshest.
I'm always happy to talk about connections because that's what it's all about to me. The way things are kind of connected to each other or at least related to each other.
And I think discovering those things is such a gift to life is, life is going to always stay lively as long as you're able to discover how a thing is like another thing and why that matters. And we all differ in that. It's just for me, that's like my main obsession in life is those kinds of things.
And not just to be cute and have a funny thing to say on the internet, but in the same way as James Burke telling us in his wonderful show, connections, stay the universe changed.
You know, I have to give credit to James Burke for having a huge impact on me, relatively late in my young person years. He was probably in college when I started watching connections over and over.
But, but that ability to say, hey, you know, the ability to recreate complicated patterns on a loom led to punch cards or put differently. We wouldn't have had punch cards if we didn't have programmable looms. Like those sorts of things where you're like, you know, and he's the king of this stuff.
Of course, you know, how interest in like thermoses and vacuums are what led to the space of such a subtle which then takes off behind him, that famous scene.
But, you know, I, to me, I have these, I don't know if they're private exactly, but they're certainly novel things that I realize were put together. A phrase I used to use when I was overtly trying to write for publishing purposes, more is to say, I found some heat.
Why didn't realize it? I was writing about this thing or thinking about this thing and I found something, found something hot this morning. I found something hot thinking about this community of anger thing that's been concerning me. Right? Like, I don't know. I don't know.
I'm not anything about that yet. You may never see anything I write about that. That's not the point. The point is I did something I'm going to be writing about because that's what I do. And there is no add a boy for that. And that's usually okay.
But sometimes something can happen to you or you see it with people, something that'll be really profound that somebody else then comes across and goes, I see what you're talking about.
And not just the fact that young people say, I do realize that, although I do wish more people would realize that. But Alex tell you that I texted them saying I had it happen to me. And I definitely happened to you.
Yes, it takes, it's taken months for some people to, I was, I was on a work call with someone and they were like, oh, well, you just let me know which events you think are important. And I was like, what did you say? I was looking forward to seeing you in Manhattan. You like New York.
I love going up to Manhattan. It's nice, strong. But yeah, I don't know, man. It's, you know, it's, I like what I do. I'm lucky.
I think anything just to wrap this up, I think the fact that the challenge here was making sure that I was one being coherent, just being understandable in some way as I'm talking about these is... Presentation part? The presentation part, yes.
It tells me that I need to continue thinking about this little bit more, but also I appreciate as you went through each of those points, the different perspectives you brought to that.
Just somebody out there, I'll be interesting to think about it in terms of like, is there some sort of, God, who was Bucky when he was the Russian guy, the winner soldier, is there somebody out there that you could activate, not for what you want, but for what they didn't know they wanted?
 I think that's an exciting way to think about it, sometimes when you're doing presentations, sometimes you don't want to give hope to the hopeless, but there are times where you're like, one way to think about it is not just like, well, what'll have to people in this room not hate, but is there somebody who needs to hear this and neither of us knows it yet?
 I think that can be kind of an exciting way to think about it, because then if you put what behind that arrow, and you're excited about what it is you have to say, you're much more likely to see other people excited about it, and to show them an opportunity for, to step into something that they didn't even know was interesting or even available until that day, you never know.
Well, I appreciate that. Hey, you said connections like five times, it sounded to get back to the madness part of the show, and now you have to come up with a connection, and I'll show you how that's done.
What about space shuttles based on thermoses? Is that okay? No, no, no, I'll show you how it's done. Well, you don't have a television, that's right. No, well, no, I have to screen stuff. I just don't want to see it.
I understand, but if I sent you a shell script, would you be able to watch something like adolescence? If I gave it to you and ask you, Eric. I mean, if you gave me adolescence, I could watch it. I just might just take me a while. I would, but I don't have a TV.
Why, let's see, my connection is going to be to finish these slides before I... Sorry, the connection, this is something we would like to do in the next weeks. In the next couple weeks, yes. Next couple weeks, okay.
Yeah, I would like to finish my slides and get a rehearsal in, only because I have to go to Amsterdam this weekend, and then I'm going to be there all next week, and then I come back and I have to give that presentation.
So there's a little bit of stress on getting things done in time, but I'm actually the proof that you can't do it. The timeline's a little tight, as they say.
What about you? What is something that you would like to accomplish? Well, the way I tend to think about this stuff that's been more effective for me, I tend to think about intentionalities. I'm not even sure if that's a real word.
I'm claiming it as a real word, because I remember when I first started working with programmers or scripting people, developers, doing cool fusion, and they used to talk about our app's functionality. And I remember early on that used to really bug me, because I'm kind of a word like obsessive.
And I just functionality, it sounded like one of those words where they're just trying to add like an extra syllable to make it sound like it was more official. Like do you really just mean the function of it? But I started to understand that, no, that is a term of art that's meaningful.
Like the functionality, it is, you could just say, yeah, it's what it does, but it's also sort of what it offers. There's something about the idea of functionality that's not all. So how is an intentionality any different than an intention? I don't know, but it meets meaningful in my brain.
So like every time, not every time, but frequently when I hear people go on and on and on about all these lofty things they're gonna do, and they got these plans, and you know, they're goals and all that kind of stuff.
I have found more use in looking at what I would call an intentionality, which is something like a just a mindful attempt to focus on a slate, alteration in the way that I do see, think, decide, whatever. So a lot of times it's intentionalities for me in the short term.
Not even usually, first of all, is this making any sense so far? So far, huh? Okay, because like, okay, goals, goal suck. I mean, if they work for you, that's great. But if they worked for you, you probably wouldn't need them.
What's your stance on themes? If it helps, that's, that's, well, I mean, like I have this really, this brutal, like weirdly practical test, a unit test almost for all of these things is, okay, so what do you do differently this morning?
And it's like, well, sometimes that's not even a germane question, because it's like, well, eat better.
Well, I guess I could eat better this morning.
It's something I do every day all day, but I think there is something bracing about constantly asking yourself, whether it's a new source of information, a new thing that somebody has demanded, you get very incensed and, you know, concerned and angry about.
All the ways people try to, hmm, maybe unintentionally manipulate each other emotionally and try to get them to feel the way they feel.
Ask yourself, okay, like really, breast tax, what do I do differently this morning? And the funny part is if you've got a goal, it's like, well, it just keeps saving money, that's my goal. And intentionality is something more specific to me.
And that is kind of pre-thinking, the kinds of things that tend to hang me up, or that I feel it could be beneficial that I need to do more. And making, I don't like to overuse the word mindful, but I'll use it once here.
To sort of mindfully decide, this is something I'm going to find myself doing. It's not something I'm going to make myself do. It's not a goal. I don't have a thermometer on the wall with magic markers to show me if I've gold, right? I have an intentionality, which is an on-grown man.
It doesn't matter. I'm a grown person. But I happen to be a grown man, mostly. They're showing me the lie. Yeah, the conduit lore is, as Kathy is very big on the theme system. And I'm not a goal or a theme person. No, I don't have a thing. The thing is, okay, here's another thing.
All right, this is a whole other thing. And I'm not trying to be touchy about this. But we all become so much less interesting if we define everything we say by what we're not saying. Because that is a way to try to entertain the simple.
That is a way to try to bring not very bright people up to speed or to get them to a comfort level where they can think anywhere beyond. They're absolutely wrote first thought about everything. And I have approximately zero time for those sorts of folks. And you hopefully don't notice it.
But there's all kinds of stuff. We're like, one of my intentionalities is just a steer clear of the people who are constantly trying to drive me off a cliff with whatever their particular hang-up is. And I need to steer clear of that.
So one of my intentionalities, for example, not that it's related, but I guess it is, if not connected, is that I try really hard to absorb in a couple of ways, the stuff that's out there in the world.
I try to absorb it in the sense of taking it in and processing it, but I also try to let things bounce off me. You know, a funny thing, it sounds like you've got a kid too. My kid's big now. But sometimes when you're a parent, you have to, if you're not firm, you're kid can't bounce.
You don't want to be a wall against which they crash their skull, but you don't also always want to be somebody throwing pillows everywhere that they might be walking.
But if you can be firm enough to be something they can bounce off of, they'll discover paths in their life that are way more interesting and useful than anything you've picked up along the way. Because by definition, you're already old and have not that much to contribute.
People have to discover who they are. They ought to perhaps always be told who they are. But one of those intentionalities is to absorb it in some way. They'll let things bounce off me. But not bounce off me as in.
That doesn't affect me bad as in like, if you're going to go out and postulate X in whatever fashion, I often feel I can't begin to postulate X until I've also explained why I'm not covering, why Z, Scooby-Doo, sous vide cooking, and Yankee's baseball.
Because in a certain sense, I do feel like there are folks who do feel like, forgive my saying, everything is everything. To say something useful, to say something assertive, to say something affirmative, we have to limit the scope of these things.
You don't have to be a theoretical philosopher or a lab scientist to know this. But it's so difficult sometimes to try to say one powerful thing without couching it alongside 35 other things. And I don't know, it's complicated business. I'm a huge fan of context.
I love the idea of trying to give somebody without telling somebody what something means, giving them a context for understanding how they might choose to situate this alongside other things. That's great for ideas. That's great for criticisms. That's great for all kinds of things in life.
It's just that it also depends a lot on how often you're talking people who get you and you get them. I don't know. Two weeks, I guess. I bow on my clock today. I'm very happy about that.
I got a bunch of stuff on Project List if you want to talk about that stuff, but you got to say something for another. Give me one. Give me one. Jesus Christ. I feel like I asked you, what do I need to do to prepare for this show? And you sent me a template for something. And let's see. Let's see.
Oh yeah, oh my God, tonight's rectif is going to be so freaking good. Oh, I'm trying to figure out the optimal connection to provide power and ethernet, et cetera, to my laptop.
And so I have a running experiment here with two different hubs, four different cables and three different ports on the hub and three different ports on my Mac. So that's the kind of thing that I'm, you know, ladies. You know what I'm saying? No, that's wonderful.
I think you have to tell the story. How did you and the bridge are both performed very well? Yeah, T.S. 4 is pretty solid. That's what I got.
Oh, can I point a personal privilege? Can I also throw out one of my plot technologies I just like to continue trying to get into the ether, if you don't mind, if you don't mind? I'm not going to get super wound up in this stuff, but people have very strong feelings about LLMs in general right now.
And I said something a few weeks ago that I just kind of really stuck with me. And I'm usually not that memorable of a speaker. So that's a big deal if I remember it.
And I found myself saying this thing to Alex on our program that I wish I could talk about the role that using something has in my life without having to talk about it in terms of the technology and the landscape and the ecosystem and everything, you know, that's sort of involved.
I don't know that it's difficult not to. And especially it's difficult not to, if somebody has a certain kind of headline they want to offer. But there's a phrase that I'm trying to use minimally, but that I think about constantly, please stop trying to turn my whole life into a tech headline.
Alternately, please stop trying to turn my life into a political headline. Like you, you, you, you all are okay, not me, but us, right? Something to think about.
Like, hey, what if we had a conversation about this thing but it wasn't about like what's the tech headline? What if you had a conversation about this but it wasn't what's the political headline?
Well, dear me, how could we possibly have any conversation about anything today that isn't about technology or politics? Go look at how much of the discussions that you see in your world are either about technology or politics.
I think that is an interesting model, even if you never share with anyone else. Think about what kind of headline your anecdote is. Think about what kind of headline your story is.
In the sense that, like, you know, I just, I sort of resent the idea of people who have an axe to grind in greater and finding people in greater, greater numbers to constantly find a way to turn almost anything into whatever their particular hang up is or their particular color of their crystal.
You know, and we see people who try to do it unsuccessfully or in smaller numbers, and this they, they look like a nut, right?
If you're the kind of person who's out there in some kind of tinfoil hat mode, always talking about, you know, the, the Rothschilds and the trilateral commission, well, that's okay.
You're a nut because you're trying to always turn something into a conspiracy. Whereas a lot of people who want to turn everything into a tackle headline merely appear very wise.
And I think we need to ask ourselves, what kind of headlines are appropriate for the stories in our life? Not that we need to go out and yell at people about it, but that we need to be aware what the headline is. Not just in the sense of, let's write the headline, you know, as a marketing tactic.
But in the sense of, like, what is this story about? Well, the story is not about data centers. The story is not about copyright problems. The story in this instance is about how I do stuff in my life.
And I don't mean to seem touchy about just that one thing, but it comes up a lot where the sort of, like, single or dual issue people in the world want to, like, dive in and turn everything into another kind of story.
And I think it's, it sucks that it's making us dumb, but it really sucks that it's making us boring. Thank you, thank you for that moment. I'll pay pay you $700,000. Oh, my glass is really gross. Oh, no, I need to clean this. Oh, no, this has coffee sludge. Oh, gross, I've been working out of this.
Oh, no, Jay. I have a curric machine that cost almost $100, and it makes ice coffee, and it might be the death of me. A lot of coffee talk that happens. I think it's going over in your neck of the woods. Make everything a coffee headline, that's what I say.
You didn't have it over there, you all right? I'm doing great. I got to, we got to finish the connections though. We got people. What that mean? People have connections. They want to tell us what they're going to do. You got to go back into that, that mass template.
No, and why don't you, you know, you're so good at this one. I'll just do it. Yeah, we're really good at it. You take care of it. Yeah, perfect. All right, here we go. See, our pathologist of the show, Laura, says, new connection, continue working with the system.
I'd like to see how this combination of notion and tick tick does for me, and I'll stick with it over the next two weeks. Our tech podcast listener, the show, Pillix says, get taxes sorted. Hey, that's, that's important. Or at least get moving on it. For both me and Mrs. Pillix, I think Mrs.
Pillix should be simple. I think we have all the documents. It's just, is that, are the problem, or at least they were last year. Our soprano of the show, Debo, says, work on feature planning for my team's next software release. Ooh, that sounds fun.
Fishfare of the show, Fishy Kai says, I've been dragging my feet about taxes. Hey, it's gonna be a big tax one, probably, for the next two weeks. Gotta do that. Tech, oh, again, Pillix, you don't get to.
The awe of the show, awe, says, my bedroom is gotten out of control, and it's always a good gauge of my mental frazzledness. I need to spend time tidying, clean room, and clean mind. Our robotics engineer, the show Aiden, says, start making plans for a bedroom remodel.
This hole in my wall needs to be patched anyway. So I should see what else I can change while I have everything out of the room. Oh, I love that. That's a good one. Our nameless of the show who also put in chat, oh, shoot, taxes. May want to change, may want to change this connection now.
Says, I just realized that Easter's around the corner. The start of busy season, not only with this holiday, but two conferences in church camp while keeping to a regular responsibilities and a day job. I need to make sure I stay on top of things or I'll drown at work.
I need to schedule regular calls with the Ministry and Department heads and get all the marshals set for any productions and work with volunteers to make sure that everything is prepped and ready to be swapped out last second. More coffees needed. Nameless, you got this.
Our identical twin of the show Aiden says, aim to be a bit more consistent and disciplined with my running where I try to get two to three runs a week at a slower pace. I've been pushing my speed a bit much lately and that might lead to injuries. Yeah, don't get hurt, please.
At our carl of all trades, the show Carl says, next connection because of the recent changes in employment status, make a plan and time of what I need to do to have a new job by August.
Where do you think of all those? I didn't understand a lot of them, but it sounds like a lot of people are thinking critically about improvement opportunities. So, you know, Aloha. Also, was I do it wrong? Did I do it wrong? No, you did it right. I don't know what any of that means.
No, it's almost all jargon. Do you're aware of that, right? Absolutely. Oh, I see what happened. Yeah, I missed like four people. I'm not gonna go through this again. It's still jargon, it's still all jargon. But I think that's part of the appeal, right? It's an ingroup thing.
Yeah, to the folks who, to the folks that I missed, because I don't know how to spread sheet apparently. Yellow, blame Kathy, she wasn't here to do it. Or you can blame me, that's fine too. If you would like to submit a connection, you can do so. You can do so in the relay discord.

I'm gonna ask you this question, Merlin, and you answer it how you feel like you would answer it. Hey, Merlin, do we do it? No, that's not what I said. It's usually how I try to answer questions, just for what it's worse, how I would, how I would answer it. Yeah. That's good.
Merlin, do we do it? Yeah.
