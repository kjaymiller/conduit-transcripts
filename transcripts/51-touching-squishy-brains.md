description: Jay is back and his brain is squishier than ever… In this episode we
  poke and prod and talk about how to use accountability to look at the forest from
  the trees and tell each other "Hey you should stop that thing you’re doing at the
  moment".

From Relay FM, you're listening to Conduot, the show we Condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduot, the show that you never know what you're going to get. This episode is brought to you by Micro.
Blog in fact, and if you want to know what that intro is so funny, you need to become a member of the Relay FM, switch on family. You can do so by going to Relay.fm slash Conduot and becoming a member today.
You can also go to I'm a superconductor, that's letter I, letter M, letter A, superconductor.com and also become a member there. We appreciate it if you do. Oh, I haven't introduced people. I'm Jay, the ominous voice that you might be hearing. I've been gone for a while.
I'm glad to be back, but who hasn't been gone and is laughing in my background of my intro? The wonderful unicorn of the internet, Kathy Campbell. Hey, Kathy. Hi, Jay. I'm so glad I got to talk. Thanks for letting me be a part of the show. I mean, it only took five minutes. I know.
Everything's fine. Kathy, what happened in the discord this week? Oh, wow. So this past fortnight has been bananas, of course, after the announcements that came out with dub, dub, dub, dub, dub, dub, dub, dub, vision pro.
Of course, had conversations as well as all of the new products, discussions about what might be coming in the fall with the phones, you know, all very techy, very important. And we also watched the Reddit breakdown in real time with people doing the research for that.
So it's been a very interesting, interesting couple of weeks.
Yeah, I don't necessarily have many opinions on the dub, dub, dub, dub, type stuff, but the Reddit situation, as someone who has used Reddit to get information on things a lot, it has relied on some of these third party applications that are struggling.
And ultimately now have announced that they're going to be going away. I like, my heart goes up to them because I've used that API. I luckily was not using it in a way that they would ask me for, you know, $20 million. But I also like, I get it.
And I kind of feel, I don't want to say both sides of the situation, but I especially feel the pain that those, those third party developers are experiencing right now. My heart goes out to them. Yeah, for sure. Yeah.
So we also had our co working, almost said co-weeking, our co-working chat last week. Again, if you want to be visit or participate in those, go to I'm a superconductor.com and become a member today.
And in that, we designed and came up with the wonderful application, which we won't tell you because we don't want you to still the name. And built, but if you want to build it for us, you can tell us. Yeah, let us know.
If only we knew some developers that would love for us to give them work, it would be great because we have a wonderful idea for a project management tool that, let's just say, we'll have people jumping for joy. No, they will have them hop for joy.
Come on, you had to go like, go all in on the puns. Well, let's just leapfrog the rest of that conversation and go straight to our shout-outs. All right, first up, thank you for Alex. Thank you for Alex. Thank you for Alex. We give thanks for Alex.
We're joined together as we give thanks to Alex Cox for joining me on the last episode. It was so wonderful to spend time with them and talk about things not robot related, although we kind of brought some robots into that too. But it sounds like the audience also really liked it.
So commented and said, thank you to Alex and myself for a fantastic, honest conversation.
I continue to adore how you normalize squishy brains and neurodiversity and disability by just, you know, having hosts and guests who are real people and are willing to take the risk of talking about real things, a really big risk sometimes. Just come to it, doing is awesome thing again.
That means so much to me. So I know how much work you put into not forcing these conversations, but bringing these conversations to other places in the world.
So the fact that you appreciate it so much just really means a lot to me because we're doing this for the community and for the group and for everyone to get to be better, but also to acknowledge your own squishy brains.
So I'm so happy that we had that episode, but also I'm kind of happy, Jay, that you're back. I mean, I, I agreed with Alex wholeheartedly when they said that Kathy has this uncanny ability to just draw the squishiest of brainy people to, to her like a magnet.
That makes it easy for folks like myself who struggle with neurodiversity and that just being one of the many intersections of things that are going on in life.
And I, I never want to do a show where we have to shy away from the reality that life is hard and that it is hard in different ways for different people.
And I mean, the show that I did before this where Kathy was the, the incredible last guest on the thing I think that made that so amazing was that we, we focused intently on finding the commonality amongst all of the different brain people. And that just continues here.
Like that's, you know, that, I don't think that's ever going to change. And if it does change, then I don't want to be a part of that change. I want to be a part of the, the let's continue to bring amazing people in regardless of their squishiness. Um, they're, they're mental squishiness.
I don't, I don't think we need to test the physical squishiness of people that teams.
 I don't, I mean, I will, I will, I don't, I'm concerned about touching squishy brains mainly because I don't know what, well, first off, you'd have to have, oh, like, oodles of consent, um, but also like being good surgeon or like bringing a surgeon, basically, let's not actually touch the squishy brains with our hands and instead touch up with our minds.
I don't know. Yeah. Kathy, you just dropped something in our, in our notes. I just, I just read this other comment from, um, Erica and sign or true, uh, Canadian correspondent. So the true, the true Canadian correspondent, I'm again, if you want to know what that's about, uh, membership, real talk.
I'd never expected a productivity podcast to be a consistent boon to my mental health, but here we are. And do it on at relay, uh, because this was a massive on thing reminds me and re reminds me that doing only as much as I can manage is not just okay.
It's great, even if it's not as much as I aimed for, uh, at Mrs. Soup and at KJ Miller, that's where you can find us, uh, bring it every fortnight in the latest episode with guest host Alex Cox blew me away such beautiful humanity. I had to listen in chunks because it was so real.
Um, thanks, Udels, Parapals. Thank you. That, I like. I know. I wanted you to read it, uh, because I think you missed it in Macedon, which I totally understand about. I don't too. So yeah, I, yeah, I don't remember how I actually saw it, but I was very happy.
And, um, I wanted to have you read it out because I'm a mean co host. That's the warm, the, the, the cockles of my heart, I think is the phrase. I'm not sure. Um, there was also a shout out to Matthew Bliss, where, um, on LinkedIn, where there was a request for favorite books and podcasts.
And the very first one was, um, based on your interest, may I suggest conduit? Um, so hey, people doing the great work out there. Oh, I'm sorry. That was Jamie Taylor. Shout out to Jamie Taylor, um, co host of the Ask a Brit podcast.
If you know, you know, um, also the host of some other nerd shows. But I, again, it's always great to, to have these moments where you never know where your people are going to see the work that you're doing and how it affects them.
So thank you so much for, uh, all the folks that make us feel awkward by giving us compliments. We love you. Um, and you suck, but we love you. I'm gonna hang up the call. Okay, bye. Just kidding. You can't hang up, Kathy, because it's time for our connection check. Zap! I love the country ones.
I don't even know. The Southern draw. It just, it gets me. Um, Kathy, um, did, did you, did you even lift? I did. I did even lift. Um, it's been absolutely bananas here as we close down the end of school.
Um, but being able to, uh, go and spend time with my kid and just, and go to the gym together and work out and help them in their strength journey, um, because they're an incredible dancer and their flexibility is absolutely off the charts.
But they need to get stronger to be able to do special things with that flexibility. And so the month of June is no dance time. And so being able to have them kind of figure out how to move their body to get a little bit stronger has been a really fun journey.
You know what they say? A family that lives together is not a family that you want to mess with. Exactly, exactly. Jay, what about you? Um, yeah, my connection was to do the minimum and adjust to new commitments.
Um, folks would know we went on this month long like this, this period in between shows, uh, to make sure that our, our editor, Javier, whom we love dearly, um, was able to take a break.
But it was kind of good timing because I was hit with a couple of family issues that had me traveling across the country while also looking at four houses across the country, um, while also trying to do my job while also trying to, um, sell a house while also trying to put on other events.
So there was a lot of things happening. And I had not actually had a full week of work in almost a month and a half, um, when I got back to work. So there was, there was a lot of like, gotta, gotta adjust, gotta like dial things down and, and move things.
And what I will say is I think the amount of work that I've given myself work wise has been top notch, it's been really good. Um, very similar to what Erica mentioned, um, doing only as much as I can manage. Um, but I feel as if things are still a little slippy.
Um, so I'm gonna, I'm gonna give myself a yellow circle only because I don't really know how to quantify whether or not I did the minimum and adjusted to new commitments.
I think I did, but I also think that there were some problems and they, and we'll talk about one of the big problems later on in the show. But about the conductors. Uh, right. Starting off with our panda of the show James connection check green check mark.
My brain remains relatively relaxed and mostly free of thoughts despite some stresses last week courtesy of dub dub 130 hours of Zelda total if we're keeping track, which we are. So proud of you, James. Very proud of you. Um, get your own the Zelda hours. That's, um, it's impressive.
It's impressive. It matches my Diablo hours. Um, the mountain dealer of the show. Oh, low, low, low, low, low, low, low. Uh, by the way, I was shouting low, game every time. So every one of you are talking on, on the episode with Alex. Um, I was excited when you tried it.
I could sense it through the internet. It was, it was there. And I hope Logan gets a fun like ping of excitement every time. But connection check yellow circle got off to a slow start missing several days. We got my workouts in every day by the end. Good job.
I mean, hey, that's, you know, I, I, I want to give it a green one. I respect the yellow because I think at the end, the goal was to start building a habit. And by the end of it, it looks like a habit was forming. So, um, but great, great work either way. Absolutely.
All right, our fish bear of the show, Fishy Kai says connect to check green heart. I did the thing. I created it did create creative. Creative. Creative turns out if I make it easy to start something, I will actually start. Who knew? Wow. What a amazing idea to make easy starts.
Cause then once it started, you just have momentum. I do an episode on momentum one of these days. I think we did. Did we? I don't remember. It's going to.
Our identical twin of the show, Aaron says connection check red square didn't get as much done as I wanted to in the past fortnight on my side project. Some UI design done, but I was aiming to get it mostly implemented. Uh, I mean, I, I hope that everything is still on track.
And I hope that, you know, you're, you're able to bounce back and get, you know, turn that red and do a little bit of yellow until a little bit of green. Yeah, I would almost say that you did do some of it, which would be a yellow square. Yeah. Maybe, but of course, your mileage may vary.
We are not going to tell you or force you into a yellow square, but we will look at you and hype you up and say, um, you did do something.
So I think it should move forward a little bit, but that's just, that's the beautiful part of aiming is even if you aim sometimes you still miss and you just got to keep adjusting until you get it. Yep. Exactly. Our oracle of the show. So says connection check green lettuce.
I am just about keeping my head above water during my very busy month. Just got to keep it going. So proud of you. That's so hard to keep your head up. Uh, and you're doing it. Hooray. I hope, I hope you got some good green lettuce in your takeaway. I mean, Carrie, I mean delivery.
I mean words are hard. And again, if you know, you know, our blue dragon of the show, it's either does blue heart. Didn't work too hard over the first part of summer. And now I'm doing a summer job while living on the beach, living on the beach. That sounds delightful. You should do that.
That's great. I love that. I love this for you. Our train enthusiasts of the show who is also a big time conduit supporter in the discord and is willing to drop the icon before I can even get to it. Uh, real Z says connection check red apple. I don't do either thing.
I need to rethink when and how I do my reminders. I really liked this connection. I mean, I don't like that. That it didn't that you have a red apple, but I do like the fact that it's letting you reevaluate things and make adjustments. I think we can learn from.
I'm not going to call this failures from misses. Maybe I think it's it's special and important to be able to recognize. So well done. Our nameless of the show. Oh, no, they have a name. Sorry. Our nameless of the show name redacted says green circle.
I managed to maintain a fairly consistent sleep routine. Mostly thanks to my puppy waking me up. Wait. Okay. That's a very good puppy. I wanted to not sleep as much. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. I understand. I don't understand. I kind of understand. However, I'm finding myself not using this time.
How I wanted some days, all I did was walk my dog and come right back inside discolors social media. But most of the time I managed to make coffee and change before logging in for work. Also, I got a puppy camera. So my wife can monitor our pup, even when she's at work.
And mocha is spoiled for choice with toys. I mean, this is amazing. This is awesome. That the puppy cam puppy cam life is is best life. So I. I fully endorse and support this. And I totally understand apparently my dog also agrees with that.
I totally understand that like I did the thing I did the thing I was supposed to do. And then right back to doom scrolling or right back to the habit that I don't want. Just progress. Baby steps. Well, maybe, maybe small human steps. Sometimes babies don't even step.
They just kind of scoop and wiggle roll over. Yeah, dog. All right, distracted Colombian of the show. Ron Mone says connection check red circle. I don't make it to the gym because I have to give my ankle one more week of healing before going on a positive note.
I was finally diagnosed with ADHD and the meds I started our life changing. So look. So it looks like I'll be able to work on my last connection and finally focus enough to finish reading my short book. One of us. One of us. Ready. Welcome to the world of medication as that help.
I'm so proud of you for being able to get diagnosed and start the medication. And you can finish the book and be amazing. And healing your ankle is great. I am so excited and I hope you will enjoy going to the gym now. Yes. And our code monkey the show Douglas Douglas says. Yo, circle.
I got my office about halfway organized and then got it all trashed again. As someone who is trying to clean up to demo house to not demo to show my house. While also trying to pack and store slash move. I feel this so much.
I clean and I clean and I clean and I turn around and my child destroys all the work that I've done. Yay, babies. That aren't really babies anymore, but still don't don't remind me. But yes, I get this and you can do it. Just remind yourself and keep just keep cleaning just keep cleaning cleaning.
Oh my goodness. All right. This episode of conduit is brought to you by micro.blog. Blogging is still the easiest way to share stuff on the web and micro.blog is the easiest way to blog. Personal blogging is making a comeback thanks to all of the disruption in social media.
And it just keeps coming to. So if you have always wanted to build your own place on the internet to keep and share the stuff you love, micro.blog is for you. Micro.
blog is the blog you will actually use because we've made it so easy to write short or long blog posts, share photos, keep a log of the books you read and even create your own podcasts. There are so many things you can do with a blog at micro.blog.
It's a great place to host a site dedicated to your special interest or hobby. For an example, one of our conductors, Chris Farrell, Farrell wrote up a blog post about how he is managing 11 projects for two work sites with team members scattered across eight time zones. And it's all on micro.blog.
We will include a link to the blog post in the show notes to check it out. It is mind blowing how I cannot even imagine managing that many people and the blog post was great succinct concise made sense. It was absolutely incredible. Jay, your note that you just type here says, Jay has micro.
blog updates. Yes. So recently I had an issue where I was trying to get my micro.blog to work. And I talked about it here and I was like, luckily they have a wonderful community and some other stuff that I could use even though my micro.blog wasn't working.
And this isn't on them because I was the special one. I was trying to host my own site that micro.blog even lets you do. But I was able to figure it out. I was able to get my micro.blog up and running and I was able to also share how I got it up and running on micro.blog.
And the last bit of that that made it so much wonderful, much more wonderful was that means that now not only when I update my personal blog, it updates my micro.blog automatically.
They also allow cross posting so that I can update folks on LinkedIn, folks on Macedon, folks on Blue Sky and folks on Twitter for a little bit longer. All of the things that I'm talking about and it means I only have to write it once and micro.
blog does all the work for me to share it to all of those other services. Amazing. Absolutely amazing. Micro.blog hosting normally starts at $5 a month, but right now you can get in on their special summer of blogging, introductory offer and have fun sharing your summer for just $1 a month.
Head to micro.blog slash summer to sign up now. Our thanks to micro.blog for their support of the show and all of relay FM. And of course, as with all of the wonderful ads and people who sponsor us and give us advertising, J's not stalling because he totally forgot to do us.
I say thank you in a different language every time and I'm actually going to say it in a language that I know only because we were talking about it in our pre chat and that is Portuguese. So I say, I'll be a God. Amazing.
So Kathy, I teased a little bit about this, this a month in like doing the bare minimum and trying to get back up to speed with things and and doing all the stuff. The challenge that I had was as as things were very, very, very, very sporadic in terms of doing work.
The amount of stuff just kept piling on and I got back home. I sat down at my desk and I said, I have so much to do. I don't even know what it all is. So I need to do the thing that conduit has taught me to do and that is get those brain frogs out of your brain and get them onto a piece of paper.
But what I kept noticing was as I would brain dump, I would write something down and then immediately start working on it, which is not what a brain dump is. So I did the one thing that I thought might help me. I reached out to one of the young golden girls of productivity. Thank you.
Thank you for being a friend. Kathy Campbell. I messaged you and said, hey, I am struggling. I'm trying to brain dump, but I keep getting distracted and I keep getting sidetracked by actually trying to do the things.
Can you help me? Can you lend a hand? And we sat on this call for an hour and a half and we talked, we laughed. But most importantly, I got stuff written down. I didn't get everything written down. I still don't have everything written down.
But I was able to get so much structured and lined out because of the accountability that I had from the unicorn of the internet. Kathy, have you ever done something like that before with other folks? So my mini unicorns and I, we haven't done it in a while because it's been a busy season.
We used to and hopefully we'll again meet on Wednesdays where we work on things. Similar to the co-working time that superconductors get to hang out with, which is one of my favorite parts of a fortnight. And combining the, our brains into one joyous little party for an hour.
But doing it with my unicorns means that I don't necessarily have to keep like data private because we know like we're talking about clients that we're working on together. And we're working on the projects that we're working together. Having brain sharing moments is really helpful.
But also sometimes you need one on one and I have a couple of friends that I do that. Because our brains work similarly, we're able to like help redirect when we need extra motivation.
And it's really, it's really helpful to just be able to have a moment to brain dump with friends because you are sitting and you're able to a be vulnerable and acknowledge what's going on with your own brain.
But then you also are able to have somebody help process things that you might be having difficulty with. So being able to sit there and be like, OK, I am being blocked right now because all I can think about is getting ready to pack for a weekend trip.
It's Tuesday and I just can't concentrate on the things that need to be done because I'm thinking about what I want to do instead. And being able to, you know, have a friend to say, hey, look, can you keep me on task? Whether it's like video sharing and they'll sit and watch you on your computer.
And when you like stop moving your mouse or tap off to something else, then we like, hey, what you doing? What's going on there? And you're like, oh, yeah, oops, I got distracted by Pinterest or something else.
And you're able to kind of help guide your brain into what's needed in a way that can be really helpful and healthy. If you have people that you can trust. And so it's important to have trusted people too. Yeah, I think the biggest portion of that is being able to be vulnerable.
I know that there's a phrase that I like to use. That usually the term underrepresented is like, oh, like it's their fault, but like no, that's how that works. With historically excluded groups of folks, there is often this fear of showing weakness or showing vulnerability.
And both of us kind of belonging to those groups in many ways, it's nice to have a place where we can show that, show that vulnerability. And it's not weakness. It is just that it's vulnerability. It's like, again, I play a lot of video games.
But not every Pokemon is great against every other Pokemon. Like some they have strengths in because of those strengths. They're also just areas that are going to be harder. There's going to be battles that are going to be harder to win. And that translates to life.
You know, you might be really good at doing these types of things, but really bad when it comes to these types of things. I personally feel like I'm really great at just doing the thing. The thing that hurts me most is when I have to sit down and plan to do the thing.
The more planning involved, the harder it is for me to execute correctly, whereas if I just go, oh, deadline, we got five minutes, got to do the thing, going to get up there, do the thing, going to be done, going to be great. Awesome.
So for me to sit down and just be like, whoa, there's a whole bunch of stuff I have to do the thing that I'm weak at doing.
If I went, you know, the conversation or how I would explain that to my boss is probably very different than, you know, the conversation that I would have with Kathy, who totally just gets me like it was just great. You should have friends that just totally get you. I agree. I agree. It's.
I am also the type of person that wants to just do things, not plan. And I have a client where we'll have a meeting and we're going through, you know, the stuff that needs to be done. And I'll be like, oh, we're going to do blah, blah, blah. And he's like, Kathy, stop doing.
We're planning right now. And I'm like, but I don't want to plan. This isn't the doing face. I just want to get it done. It'll take like half an hour, except it never actually takes just a half an hour because humans as a rule are terrible at estimating.
Well, I know that there's like this idea of like planning to plan or in developer speak. There's a phrase called bike shedding where like, oh, we have this problem. And the problem involves a bike.
And we spend more time planning what the bike shed looks like than actually like storing the bike or getting on the bike and writing it. I feel like that is the weakness that I have of like, if I start planning is I get really good at just doing the planning.
And then it's like making those transitions. So maybe it's not even that like the challenge is is identifying the time of like, okay, it is this time. That means you do this and only this. And then that time has to have a start and an end.
And the more space you give for interruptions of those things, the less effective that that time really is. But I love that that I'm not alone in that you also have other friends, which breaks my heart, but I'm also glad that you have other friends. I'm sorry. It's okay. No, don't be sorry.
But you have friends that you are willing to say like, hey, you have permission to yell at me and tell me that it's not doing time. It's planning time. Or as the thing would say, it's clobbering time. We got a clobber these plants. Big happened. It's clobbering time. That needs to be on the time.
I don't think I spoke clobbering correctly, but that's fine. No, you did not. Listen, I've been having a very hard week with that whole spelling thing. I spelled someone's name Sebastian. So wrong. I could not identify that it was meant to be Sebastian. I'm sure that crab was very upset with you.
Yes, yes, he was. He was very, very sad. Very, very sad. Have you seen the new movie? No, you're not a Disney movie. I don't watch movies. Yes, especially to watch Disney movies. Well, actually, has the important person in your household seen it? Yes. That's all I've ever seen.
One of the things that I wanted to ask because this kind of intersects into your love of things, robots and isms, but especially robots. There are so many tools that work to be that other person in the room with you helping you to accomplish things.
Do you think that these can be effective, but then also for you, do you think that they could be effective? I think it depends on the brain space and what level of squishiness it's doing. Here we go. It's touching brains again. I know we're touching brains.
Touch, touch, touch, squish, squish, squish. Because there's sometimes that certain things will work that other days definitely, definitely will not work.
And I have to be in the right mindset and give myself permission that if I'm not in the right brain space to do something that may be worked yesterday, that that's okay and to try something else.
It's a good thing there's so much productivity stuff out there because there's always something new to try. I think that the challenge that I have with it is something that we touched on earlier, touch, touch, touch, squish, squish, squish. I need someone with the ability to tell me no.
I'm very good at that. I tell you no. Less so myself, but I get to tell other people to say no. AI is just by design really bad at the no, at the no part. I mean, you have some tools that are like, I will hide this from you. I will try to catch your attention with distractions of other things.
But the only time it tells you no is when it like you actually wanted to give you an answer and then it misjudges your question and goes, as an AI, I am not capable. It's not even telling you no. It's just telling you like, I'm sorry Dave, I can't do that. That's more of the sentiment that it has.
That's where I need in many ways the ability for it to say, I understand that that's what you want to do. But that now is not the time for that. And again, I know that people have tools. I know that they're like distraction apps that you can use and things like that.
I remember one of my favorites being, what was the tree one? The one where you plan a tree? Oh, yeah. That one was so great because it was like, I'm not going to tell you no, but you're going to kill this tree if you do something else. And I was like, but I don't want to have like that.
And funny, it's a little virtual tree. It doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things. But things like that were there was a power in that of it's like, you have the ability. I can't stop you. But there is an immediate consequence to going against what you are set out to do.
I totally just like blacked out in what you just said. I have no idea what just happened. Oh my gosh. Real time brain. Like I didn't follow anything that you just said. So someone needs to poke Kathy's brain. Check for squishiness.
I didn't have any caffeine today, but I've been not having as much caffeine lately. And that's fine. But I think maybe today I need some in order to get it to process. Maybe I need to bring them with something.
Is that like an intentional like we're trying to cut back on the caffeine or just kind of been a pattern? It's just kind of been a pattern mainly because it's so hot. And I don't like making the iced coffee myself because it's always like not as good as other people make it.
But it's just been absolutely ridiculously overwhelmingly way too hot here. And the thought of drinking coffee is just like me. I totally get that. I mean, there are other caffeinated beverages. Some that are even cold. I know. I have a couple of monsters in the fridge.
So I might grab one of those. I... That actually makes me think of a point that you... I think you do really well. Which is... showcasing the... the forest from the trees, I guess. Which, you know, the old thing... You miss the forest from the trees or something.
You can't tell the forest from the trees. Like when you're in the thick of it, which makes me... TikTok has destroyed my brain because I immediately went backyard against the thick of it. Yeah. I did too. I did too. Even though my brain is broken. So good.
When you're in growth in a task or when you're in growth with your... the issues or the problems that you have, it is hard to remember that in many ways, as long as you don't have one of those giant, like... mushroom forest things where it's all really just one organism.
Like, if one tree dies in the forest, the forest is still there. Like, you can cut that tree down and the forest still exists. What happens is when you start cutting down a bunch of trees in the forest that becomes a problem.
Or, as the banana problem happened, where bananas used to taste really good and look amazing, there was a bacteria that just annihilated an entire... like an entire like type of banana. And nobody gets those bananas anymore. Yeah. Fun fact, that's what the banana flavor in candy was like.
It tastes like... Yeah. So like having the ability to have someone take a step back and look at your overall forest and go, huh, hey, I know you're really fascinated with this one problem right now, this one tree. But the rest of the forest is on fire. Can you go address that right now? Yeah.
Or there's literally no water in the riverbed. Can you figure that out? Like, why? Why? That's not how you think it should be? Yeah. I just... Ugh. Yeah. It's always helpful to have friends that can do that. Or enemies.
I mean, to be fair, it probably could be helpful to have an enemy be your productivity co-working partner person too, because it'd be really mean. I like to think of them as rivals. Ooh. And I will say I have rivals that don't realize that they're rivals. And it's all love.
But at the same time, I am looking at your success going, I want this. Yes. Yes. Yes. And it's probably not healthy. However, it is effective. Right. I mean, look. Like, James, time to start the enemies to lovers productivity podcasts. Yes. Enemies to lovers to rivals to friends. Maybe.
I don't know. We're like enemies to... Nope. Crash and burn. We're going to... I went... We'll workshop it. We'll work on that. Oh, good call, Sky. They replied with their Rectives podcast app. And that's the podcast image. And yeah, that's pretty accurate. I love that. Perfect. Oh, my gosh.
Well, we have carried on for a while. And I know that a part of what we do is older ourselves accountable. And I still have a bunch of work that I need to get done. So let's go ahead and proceed to our next sponsor. This episode of Condoet is brought to you by Factor.

Now, the last factor, Adrien, I gave my experience. Jay, what was your experience with the factor meals? I was thoroughly impressed.
I think that the challenge with a lot of meal prep, kits and meal kit things is definitely that balance of how good is the pre-cooked meal versus how much work do I have to do to make my meal? And that is something that I think factor does really well.
The fact that I don't have to sit there and pull out knives and cut and mix and chop and do things, that I can just heat this meal up, is really, really helpful, especially when you have a kid that is super picky and they're not going to eat anything, so then you just make them mac and cheese.
And then you have to be like, oh, but I have to now spend this time cooking a separate meal for myself. No, I don't. I just have to put a factor meal in the microwave, heat it up.
And it tastes just as good as if I had spent all that other time working to put it together and, you know, stressing and possibly cutting off one of my fingernails, which has only happened the one time. I didn't have to do that. I didn't have to go through that.
And it was such a great thing when you're thinking about it from the perspective. And then also just being able to sometimes just grab a smoothie when you don't want to cook or grabbing something super, super small.
I think that factor has kind of nailed the convenience versus flavor than diagram of things. Absolutely agreed. This June, get factor and enjoy eating well without the hassle. Simply choose your meals and enjoy fresh flavor packed meals delivered to your door. Ready in just two minutes.

So I think my my connection is going to be simple. And I'm going to, I guess it's not super simple, but I am going to take the things to goodwill. Okay. We have like five or six bags of clothes that we've gone through and are ready to get rid of. And they have been sitting by my front door.
They haven't even made it to my trunk, but they have been sitting at my front door for about two months now. It's not going to be very difficult. It's it won't take a long time. I just need some accountability to get the bags from my house to the car to goodwill.
And so I am calling upon my conductors to check in with me to see if I can get the frickin stuff to the frickin goodwill. I feel this so much because we have bags of things that were supposed to be sent to goodwill so long ago. And we just just it has not happened. So I you're not alone in this.

Like two hours out of the day, putting things away, packing things up, setting them down and then like getting them figured out and situated. That's that's going to be my goal for this next conduit. Amazing. What about those people that we love so much that talk to us? Our amazing conductors.
