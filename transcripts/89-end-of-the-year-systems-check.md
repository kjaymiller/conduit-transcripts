From RelayFM, you're listening to Conduit, the show we Condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that takes all of the system checks we've done for the last year. Put some into AI and then does a super systems check.
Wow, I did not approve the use of AI for this. I was not about to read all the transcripts, which were also AI generated just to come up with another thing. This episode is brought to you by E-Camp.
I'm Jay and as you've heard with me is my wonderful co-host who I think this is the last episode you'll hear both of us at the same time. Until the first year, hold on. We did do on, oh yeah, yeah. So this is our last joint one until 2025. Yeah, but it's got the cable hey, Kathy. Hey, I'm excited.
So next episode, Jay's running off to do the Jay things that Jay does, but I have a very special guest already. I'm so mad that you guys the guest that I wanted to get. Ha ha, suck it. I almost did a thing just in spite of that and I was like, now I can't do that.
What? What were you? What were you almost going to do? I will tell you, I since last week in the co-working, we and our superconductor friends discussed new jobs and holding out on what Jay talked to Kathy's mom about while we were in London.
There was, I was going to see if I could weasel away into like, hey, how do I get Kathy's mom on the show? Considering my mom is going to also be with me, that's going to be very difficult. The whole reason that I can't be on the show. I was like, that's probably with her.
So spoiler alert next episode. Do we want to do it? No. Okay, well, I'm not going to, okay, fine, I won't give it away. However, because of the specialty of that host and the scheduling, the show will not be recorded live. It will be recorded the same day.
So please continue to send in your connections for that day. But it will not be recorded live. I believe that is the same for the show that I'm doing as well. I believe we are recording on the same day.
But we're recording a little bit later than we usually would and it won't be, it just won't be live streamed. Yeah. Okay, so this is the last live show until 2025. Which if you're listening to this in your podcast app of choice, you already missed it.
That doesn't matter because it's our recording pass. But I guess we can talk about this a little bit because we don't give official things very often. But this sort of readout stuff. But the show records live every fortnight on Tuesdays at 10 a.m. Pacific time.
Which also is the same time as our co-working space. I guess I'm just kind of going into, you know, the, the next part. So we're, we'll just listen, I'm going to take a leak. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, those are at the same time. 10 a.m. Pacific time is the magic, magic time on Tuesday.
So if you are a superconductor, that is the time to know because you can listen to us live in most, most of the time live in the discord or on our co-working sessions. Yeah. And speaking of the discord, Kathy, what, what happened this last conduit in the discord? Yeah.
The thing that you have been waiting for or not been waiting for if you had no idea it was coming. So every year, Justin, creator of the amazing app affirmations, puts out a call where you have a, there's a Google form that you can submit songs for the most epic break room playlist ever.
And he submits the, like, sends out the link. So we'll include a link in the show notes with a, you know, a caveat of like this was submitted. It's, it's chaos. It's joyful. It's a little bit of everybody, like in Hashtag Break Room, sharing the love for songs that they enjoy.
It does actually seem pretty interesting, but it's pretty. Yeah. Yeah. I'm already puppies on here. Okay. I already approved. Yeah. There's such a wide range of songs and artists and albums and whatnot and it's pretty fun. It's pretty fun.
So if you want to, you know, discover some new music or listen to some classics that you forgot about or just kind of get the vibe of what the discord is. We'll put the links in the show notes and we hope you enjoy. Yeah. It is, it is a thing. I'm still scrolling there.
There are a lot of songs on here. Yes. And part of that is because our favorite panda of the show James submitted five songs each day. There are 11, it's 11 hours of unique, very diverse jams. Yeah. My submissions, by the way, were Christmas songs from the Insync Christmas album. So you're welcome.
I saw those and I was like, that might be Kathy. Yep. It was. Yeah. So if all of that sounds like fun, hey, it is. We have fun in the relay discord and you should join. And you'll not only get access to that, you know, wonderful discord, but if you join by going to I'm a super conductor.
com, you'll be supporting Condo it. And a little bit, but for each systems check episode, we always invite all of the brand new folks to the podcast in and we do a little bit more explaining than we usually do. But for now, it's time for the shout outs. Shout outs to Aaron. I'm not going to say it.
The identical twin of the show Aaron says I'm not going to lie. Mostly picked out a holiday named a bug J. Yep. Yep. Yep. That's what people do here. They do things directly to fight the cramudge in me. Yep. Yep. With love. We do it with love.
And then last episode we talked about our soprano of the show, Debo's. And then we talked about the fact that the oven was broken for more than a year, but it turns out they have a really nice convection toaster oven that they've used, which like really, that makes so much more sense.
I was a little concerned that it was like just microwave survival in the kitchen for a year, which you know what, that's also okay because it's yeah. Yeah, but thank you, Debo, for for letting us know a little bit what the situation was. I appreciate it.
And then it is time for our connection check where at the end of every show, we give ourselves a thing that we hope to accomplish by the next show. And we check on them at the beginning of the show.
So Kathy, what was your connection? My connection last fortnight was to clean up and fix up my bedside table. I did this. I did this about two and a half hours ago, because I had not had the motivation, but this is exactly what these types of things are.
These connections, they can be as big or as small as you want them to be. And really it's just a little bit of motivation, a little bit of inspiration, a little bit of, I was going to say affirmation, but clearly my brain is still on Justin's stuff, but the inspiration. No, not perspiration.
Accountability, which is not a nation, but that's fine. Accountabilitation. Yeah. No, awesome. And yes, I do love the, oh crap, what was my connection? Oh, let me do that really quick, because a lot of connections don't take a lot of time, but sometimes they take a lot of mental energy to do them.
And having a deadline, even an artificially set deadline can make the difference between getting a thing done and that thing just kind of lingering on for years, some cases. Yeah, agreed. So my mind was to use AI to do things that are not important.
Look, I'm not here to say that like AI is going to change the world. I'm also here to say that like most of the like destroying the world is done prior to you typing in the prompt to chat GPT. So the destruction has been done. Also, I'm not going to lie.
I found out that my boss is the number one user of AI at our company, which means nine times out of 10, the stuff that I'm sending to them is not being read by them.
And they specifically said it is like they're taking emails, they're taking documents, executive summaries and all these things, feeding them through AI and getting summaries of the summaries.
So at that point, I was like fair gay, like the AI is going to be talking to each other for the rest of time. Thanks robots. Yeah, well, and I will this isn't Roboism because I do have my concerns about things like how these these things were trained.
I also think I can put myself in Frederico the teaching shoes who Frederico has openly said that he feels like his data was was taken from him, but also that's not going to prevent him from using them in a way that he feels is ethical to his industry.
I have kind of taken a similar approach where like my usage of it is not my consent and how it was trained. I do hope that one day we can start training on purely, you know, completely open source grounds to my knowledge.
Some people said that that's what they thought they were doing and they were wrong. But ultimately there are some things that I have to do in my job that are just they are literally CYA, which stands for cover your after parts. And that like that type of stuff is hey, I did this thing.
We had these conversations. These conversations need to be wrapped up into a nice little summary and then shot out just in case someone two years from now goes, who was it that made that decision and why I can go here's a document.
And that document can answer the question and I have done that and I've done that to the point where I honestly can't show you because some of it is like proprietary for work.
 But what I've done is I've taken these weekly summaries that I have to write and I have basically taken all of all of the slack messaging inside of our very public known to be very public section and I've told people that this is happening so there is some like hey, if you don't consent to these messages being used speak now forever hold your peace and no one spoke now.
So pieces being held forever. And I basically say, hey, create a summary of what happened this week using these conversations. And it does a fantastic job that saves me hours of time of trying to figure it out.
And then in the end, I take those summaries, I send it back to the people and I go, hey, make any corrections. There are almost always corrections that need to be made that being said, I don't have to be the person to make them. So this is a check mark in my book.
I have, I have used AI for things that are not important and also it gave me an opportunity to delegate one of my biggest pain in the butt tasks on to the people that in reality should be doing it anyway since it's me summarizing their words. Yeah, yeah, I can get that. I get it. I get it.
It was also used significantly in the preparation of this show. But again, that was just there's a lot of reading. It's me. I don't read. I wasn't about to read like three hours of conduit dress. No, that's a very good point. Yeah. What about our conductors? Yeah.
So starting with our artists of the show, connection, Carly, who says green circle, I survived my first week at my new job because yes, we have had several conductors get new jobs in the last four night. And I'm so happy and proud of all of them.
Yes, hearing, hearing Carly jump in like, I'm not going to, I'm not going to talk about all the things that happen when they happen, but Carly jumped into let us know that new job unlocked and there was much rejoicing and celebrating in the the co working space.
Our checklist enthusiasts of the show Mike says yellow heart replace my broken hard drive and recover the data from back place. I have a new hard drive and restored. Most of the data, but the data transfers take a while. Yes, they do. Kathy, I actually deleted a bunch of data off of the cloud.
Nothing, nothing of conduit, but I was paying like an extra $10 a month for data that I was just like, I'm never going to use this data and no one's holding me to it. I'm going to save myself $10 a month. That's great. Yeah, super smart. Save that $10. Speaking of new job, oh wait, just kidding.
I scrolled too far. Our soprano of the show, Debo connection check green heart ordered a new oven. Hurray. Yay. Artek podcast listener of the show, Pillix says green apple. I worked on pod shift. I applied for jobs and well, I don't need to do that anymore because I now have a job.
Congratulations, Pillix. I didn't figure out the oil change in order the mechanic, but I won't need my car as much next week so it can wait. No, that's not get your oil changed, find a mechanic. You don't want to have issues getting to work or something because of the car being a problem.
And even if you work from home, you don't want to lose time working from home while dealing with a car that's messed up. So no, you're not off the hook on getting the oil change or the mechanic. No, he didn't say he didn't say that he wasn't going to do it.
Just not as like, oh, hi, he's also in the live show calling you out. You guys even so then you just have a broken car sitting there, probably getting more broke. I'm okay with you public with taking public transportation. By the way, Pillix is in our live chat and says, I'm going to take the bus.
Again, that's perfectly fine. Do the responsible thing and get your car checked up on because lingering problems can cause other lingering problems. And you might need your car in an emergency or for some other reason. And then you won't have access to it. Sure.
Anyways, our chief swifty of the show Andrew says green checkmark. I am making progress on connecting my workflow for actions and files. I found a few challenges with hookmark being Mac OS only.
However, Claude from Anthropic has been a huge asset as a coding buddy for Apple script array for Claude. That is my that is my large language model companion of choice as well. That and Lama or Jim not Jim and I Lama 3 point to which I run locally on my computer.
Our shark of the show one pair of shoes says last connection was to kitten proof my office green heart. I made a lot of improvements, but I can tell this is going to need some iterations. These kiddies are smart. Yes.
And until they are full grown cats and they lose all their little sharp kitten bits for the still sharp but slightly less sharp kitten bits than they continue to be an annoyance. But they're so cute. So it's worth it. That's worth it.
Our fish bear of the show fishy guy says green heart for some reason. I was very productive this past conduit household admin list is much smaller well done. I like it. Our car of all trades of the show Carl says connection check green chicken yellow is a awesome beaver. Beaver. It's so small.
I can't see it. I started a replay of study value of resulta. It's my optometrist thing. So too. Hmm. Hey, you don't listen. We're going to call you out. Go do take care of yourself. Like you're complaining to pellets for taking care of his car. My prescription hasn't changed.
Just my text is really, really small. But Jay is a video game tempris for suggesting timberborne. I also gladly as a professional video game judge be happy to play test errands game. The one that'll have Jay and Kathy in it. As for work and job hunting.
I should look for a job to apply to mostly as practice at job searching because I'm not good at that. That is true. The job hunt. I'm sure the folks that just found jobs can tell you the job hunt is in many ways its own full time job and like most jobs they require skills. But as for games.
I just posted on all the places that I have found a new game. Well, it's an old game. It came out last year called bro Tato. That is like a hey, you've got to walk around attacking the things.
But it's such a like I can turn my brain off game and just walk around and hit the little things and be so happy. And when I lose I go, ah, and then I start the game over. Kathy, does that remind you of any other games that I would normally play where I can just turn off my brain? Weird.
You know, there's one that you haven't mentioned in a while. I forget what it's called. It's been so long that I'm just not sure. Yeah. No, it's definitely a companion to my Tetris addiction, which is still very much there. I play.
I don't play every day, but I play probably three to four times a week still. The ah of the show says yellow book. I had 500 plus pages of documentation to read for work. My goal was to read half of it, which I did not do. But frankly, I have no idea why I thought I could.
I did, however, find some good training videos on the subject and did a solid training session with my manager. So I feel I have a decent grasp. Well done. I like it. A robotics engineer of the show Aiden says green heart still have a few things to figure out, but things are continuing a pace.
That's another good $10 word right there. A piece. Good word. Our identical twin of the show Aaron Glendorbread McLeod. That says green circle. I got a vampire enemy type implemented and working also found an entirely unrelated bug while testing and managed to fix it. Well done.
The vampire enemy type should be Jay and he sucks the fun out of. I mean, that is pretty on brand. The name was of the show nameless says yellow circle. I got sidetracked and did not work on my lesson plans, but I did think about them. Frames did not get bought. I don't have a reason for why not.
It's okay. You don't have to. They just didn't happen and that is also okay. And finally, our Oracle of the show. So says connection check yellow heart. I've not been doing so well at going swimming three days a week as my health is still not 100%.
But I've been managing once or twice a week and that is start absolutely. I love that. Little as you can little bit as at a time. This episode of conduit is brought to you by Ecam. Ecam live is the leading video production and live streaming studio built for Mac.
Ecam does all aspects of video, not just live streaming. It's perfect for simplifying your workflow. It's easy enough to get started quickly, but powerful enough that you can create just about anything with video. You can do it all with the Ecam app. Now, Jay, I'm pretty sure you still use Ecam.
Absolutely. I'm a big fan of Ecam. I actually just recommended Ecam to someone who was interested in getting into streaming, but not interested in doing all of the little streaming bit stuff. But I actually used Ecam was it two weeks ago right after our last episode of conduit.
And it's not that I don't use it all the time. It's just lately I haven't been able to use it all the time because I'm working on a slightly sensitive topic or thing at work where I'm not allowed to share things publicly.
So I have less, less things that I could actually live stream, but the nonprofit that I started Black Python devs is now doing monthly meetups and their virtual because we have people all over the world.
And we were recording these straight from discord in through Ecam into files to make it really easy for me to go back and edit. And I think the thing that's really interesting about this is that normally I would have so many different audio interfaces that I'm having to record at one time.
But the nice thing is that's just my streaming setup. So I was like it made the process super easy. All I had to do was select the discord app. I moved it to full screen. That way it was at the full resolution.
And then I just had all of the normal audio interfaces that I would normally have if I were doing something like this open. And it just kind of worked.
So I think if you're, if you want something that's super, super custom and all of these other wild things like Ecam does that, but more than anything else, Ecam. Simply works. And that's probably like the best advertisement that I can give is that it just works. Yeah.
And it's so easy for people to learn on like I've used it a few times where I'm just like I have no idea what I'm doing. And then I go in and it's just like, oh, the default, the understanding it all just, it just makes sense. And that's really, really nice to have that work.
Whether you're streaming, recording, podcasting or presenting everything's there in Ecam, including support from multiple cameras and screen sharing and a live camera switcher lets you direct the show in real time.
Stand out from the crowd with high quality video at logos, titles, low earthers and graphics. Share your screen, drop in video clicks, bring on interview guests, use a green screen. And so much more Ecam live does it all.

So I have been on the fence about if I should get a Mac mini and like that is I mean if I won one that just makes life easier. I don't have to I have to think about it as much. But yeah, like this would just be super easy. That would make that would make a lot of decisions very easy for me.
Okay, I did everything except for the the last thing which is the secret code which I have to go back and read to get the secret code. So that's that. But I'm glad that we're talking about tools because Kathy we've done two years of connection checks.
Yeah, and it's been kind of wild, wild west out here. No, we'll Smith. I feel like we we should wrap these into what I am calling the teenage mutant ninja techniques of conduit. I'm kidding. I did have a only lightly. Yeah, I did have an acronym that did make TNMT which made me really happy.
One of them was a stretch, but yeah. But in this I wanted us to do our regular connection check after we compare them to or after we look back at our connection checks throughout the year. And when I say throughout the year, I mean basically from.
Oh, no, did it cut you cut one off from episode 62, which was our winter. No, our fall of 2023. All the way up until today. So episode 62 it messed up and it didn't it didn't include this in my shorter summary. So this one to be a little bit longer.
Actually, before we do that, Kathy, what is a systems check in why are we doing this? I got a great question. So on the show in conduit, we tend to not try and do too much like specific.
Hey, we're going to discuss and talk about like these specific tools or we're going to recommend X Y Z for getting things done. Please don't hate me, David, all it. The problem with that is every person is different. Every individual is going to have different needs, different requirements, etc.
And we want to support the individuals to make the individual choices that work best for them and getting their work done or not getting a work done if you need to rest.
But the idea that coming on to a productivity podcast and picking it you like doing everything because this is going to make you productive is something that we we have not necessarily fought against, but definitely it's not it's not what the show is about.
However, once a quarter, we do like to come and just be like, hey, here's what we're doing share with us with what you're doing. Use it to get some ideas, but still know that how you do your work and the system that you do and use is individual.
And trying new toys and tools is great, but also not necessarily necessary. And so whatever works for you as long as it continues to work is the way that it should be. Yeah, I think more than anything productivity is there's a reason we call it personal productivity because personal.
Not, you know, you shouldn't be afraid you should be afraid to share it. I think it's more just a. Hey, in the moment you're doing a thing. Why are you doing that thing? I don't know. But if I come into a conversation after hearing someone say I use.
I'm a law blog task or this that focus then I like if I'm immediately checked out for that reason, then you know I'm in the wrong for that. I should be thinking about like, okay, what's going to help.
You know, myself for this other person, the most in what they're already doing because at the biggest thing that I think we've learned just over years and years of carrying about being our best selves. And you know that we can possibly be is that it doesn't come with gigantic changes to things.
Usually it's it's the optimizations are in very small adjustments. Yeah, one of and it's so funny that the timing of this worked out really well. So we have one of the channels in the discord is called hashtag systems and themes. And this is kind of the productivity channel of. Side of things.
And one of our one of the discordians Nick was like, hey, what do you call it when you have a productivity system in place that you just completely ignore.
It was really timed perfectly because it allowed this kind of discussion to discuss like what is up with your system that it needs to be flexible. It needs to be moldable. It needs to adjust and make changes as things happen. But it also needs to be allow you to forgive yourself.
And and be willing to understand that no matter how much time and energy you put into the scaffolding of the system. If it does not work for your brain or if it's far too complicated stuff is not going to get done. Yeah.
And that will be a thing that I talk about for my new system is just having room for forgiveness. But we'll we'll get to the. Kathy, did you want to go first? Did you want me to go first? Well, you we started this with you saying how much time you put into things.
So I'm kind of thinking that you should go first just because you put in all of that energy. Oh, it's fine. Hey, I did most of the work. So episode 62. This was the fall of 2023. It was a simpler time. I was using a plotter notebook with prioritized task lists.
I just switched to spark mail for personal email. I had moved from to do us to things for task management. And I was using bike for outlining and planning. And I was trying to especially focus on delegating and collaborative work. This is interesting.
Now that I'm coming back through this, I was like, oh, yeah. I still use my plotter notebook, but I use my plotter notebook more for meeting notes than actual like tasks. Which I think the next systems check talks about why for that. I still use spark for personal email.
I have really no reason other than spark just works. It works. I have multiple inboxes. I like how spark combines the inboxes in some ways and keeps them separate in other ways, which is really nice. It molds to my brain in a decent way. And it's an app that I had used and not used over some time.
But now that I actively have multiple inboxes, it's easy enough. It's an easy enough lift that I don't want to think about email too much. And to be honest, I don't use half of the features that spark comes with. It does have some AI. Like, let me write that for you features. Not going to lie.
I use them a lot, especially when I don't really care. Yeah. A.I. has become the I don't care like solution of, oh, I need to write a letter about the trash pickup or something. Hey, I write a letter about the trash pickup or hey, my daughter is going to be out of school because she's sick.
Write a letter to the school saying my daughter has a fever and I won't be there and she won't be there for the next week. Like, yeah, I don't want to have to think about it. I just do it. It's smooth from to do us to things. Yeah, I have not used I've looked at to do this, but I have not used it.
I've looked at thing. Well, I haven't looked at things at all lately. So both of those are just kind of not being used at all for anything. And then using bike for outlining and planning. Yeah, I haven't done that either. Not not for any lack of of reason.
Just honestly, I uninstalled bike recently because I was like, you're not using it. And I wanted I wanted a reason that like if I went and reached for it and it wasn't there, then I would be like, okay, cool. I don't get it. That make it.
But just having it sitting there, I'm like, I'll get to it eventually. And then the last one was focus on delegating and collaborative work. The delegation stuff is definitely there.
I'm about to make a bunch of announcements saying that, you know, in my nonprofit, there are going to be more people making bigger decisions. Making more and more off of my plate so that I can focus on other things. But also, even even with work, I'm the collaborative work is definitely there.
The delegation is is not entirely there. It was there for a long point. And then we had a round of layoffs that hit. And at that point, basically all the people that I was delegating work to were unfortunately laid off. Oh no. Luckily, the managers who assigned that work were also laid off.
The problem just went away magically. Amazing. How's it work? Yeah.
 All right, Kathy from episode 62, the full switch to omnifocus for task management, doing morning pages daily, having a more creative bullet journal for productivity and artistic expression, implementing a weekly reset routine on Sundays that includes brain dumps, task review, paper processing, setting up weekly spreads and self care and celebration.
Wow. You remember writing any of that. I do actually I do go me. Yeah. So. Okay, can you can we go off? Can you read them one by one? The fully fully switched to omnifocus for task management. Yes, that is 100% here.
I use it mainly for my repeating tasks, things that happen weekly or monthly to come in and run. During the you and me. I am excited to say.
Every blog hireخر group in my convenience, there was another message I presented initially to come in and remind me eight or if I am out and about and something is the address. I'm like elegant. I'll Police to come in and remind me a while if I'm out and about. And something is like, It's working.
Ish. Doing morning pages daily. Yeah, I haven't done morning pages in a very long time. I'm scared to look at my notebook and even see when the last day that I wrote anything is.
What are morning pages for those? So morning pages are just kind of like a journaling practice in the book, the artist's day. It discuss like morning pages for writers to come and write like five pages of work of like just writing whatever comes to mind.
Coming in and just like spilling whatever thoughts are in your head. I did it. I was like a number of pages, but kind of a timeframe, which gave myself permission to be to write more or less depending on kind of what my energy for the day was.
And this also adds into it like if I want to write more I can. Or if I'm done and I don't want to write anything also good. However, I have not done them in a very very long time. What about your more creative bullet journal for what was it? Let's see for both productivity and artistic expression.
Yeah, so I've actually been doing a lot more of this. So I do a fun like cover page for the month, which has like a theme. And I write the month really pretty. And on one page and the other page has like a full calendar. Nothing's written on each of the calendar days.
Like it's just like one, two, three, four, five. Like they're just numbered. And just kind of it gives me an opportunity to kind of be creative in a way that doesn't matter.
And then I'm also doing mood trackers and then a highlight list where I just then kind of writing down what happened that day that I want to remember. And then the mood tracker to just kind of so it's like little drawings that are then color coded for my mood over for the overall day.
November is leaves. And December will be ornaments because I've already set up my December spreads. See, I was I was wondering about that in the there are times where I will look at old bullet journals.
And I don't look at it for like what was that task that one time it was more of like where was I? Where was my head at? Yeah. What was I was I thinking about and kind of those things.
What I think about like those monthly spreads, if you can do a nice little design, you add a couple of things that are top of mind that you got to get done that month. And you have, you know, some trackers set up for things that you felt like in that moment were really important.
I feel like that's just a great way to like go back and just go at the beginning of this month. This is where my head was at. Yes, yes. And that's kind of what I want to. In this form, we'll talk about it for future plan that the last couple months have been a good practice of it. Okay.
And then the big one. What about the weekly reset? Yeah. So I did it like once. But I had a, let me rephrase, I did it like once in the way that that was laid out. However, I have started doing things Friday afternoons. So I have a weekly meeting.
It's almost every Friday at two o'clock, which means it's over by three. And after that, I don't want to do anything. I am, I am pretty much done for the day. But instead of like feeling guilty and going off to rest or do anything else, I've started kind of doing my setup things.
And like whatever that afternoon. So I haven't, I need, I want, there is no need. I want to start doing my official reset on Friday afternoons.
What I have been doing is just setting up the weekly pages, but I want to start kind of doing my review over what happened for the week because I'm kind of forgetting. The way my brain works is I pretty much forget when something's done. Like as soon as something's done, I like it leaves my brain.
And I, I want to do better at remembering not just the bad things that happened, but the good things as well. So that I can try and grow to be a better, a better version of myself, which is ultimately what systems are for. I also cleaned up and like made it a tighter version of the reset.
So there's just, there's fewer things to look at, but also definitely keeping in the celebration part of things because it's important to celebrate.
So having heard that from from episode 62, how, how would you describe the Kathy Campbell of that time? Who little did she know how burnt out the next year would bring her?
And the acknowledgement and realization of what was going to come meant that the prep work that she had done was not going to be the foundational idea of what was is going to be needed.
Does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah. I, I think that for myself, I, I feel like a lot of the groundwork was put in place to go ahead and do the things that I'm doing now. As the next episode will talk about I, I changed jobs like shortly after, after this.
I think actually when we recorded this, I was, I hadn't started interviewing yet, but I was about to start viewing for the role that I'm in now.
So I, I think that there was a lot here that was kind of foundational to how I would do things, especially going into a role where a little bit more was expected of me. And I, yeah, I don't think that I don't think I had it wrong.
I think that I just didn't know what was about to happen, kind of like what you were saying. Yeah. Yeah. And that's, that's, that's a hard part about, you know, any sort of planning that you do.
And it's also something that has definitely affected my mental space is that you don't know what the future is going to bring. Which in and of itself is not necessarily a bad thing.
But when you have gone through trauma, it's, it's, it's, I'm not going to say normal, but it's understandable to have moments of being scared to do too much planning. Because the world's going to come and laugh at you and be like, ha, ha, ha, you thought that you were going to do XYZ.
But guess what? Just kidding. Well, let's see if you held on to these things in episode 69, which was the winter. Nice. Systems check. Kathy, let's start with you. You continue bullet, bullet journaling and you switched a weekly spreads instead of daily ones. Yeah.
You're still using omnifocus for task management. You joined a monthly stationary subscription box for planning supplies. And you set up your weekly spreads on Thursday with calendar items, a gratitude space, trackers for spending and exercise meals.
And then you begin working on maintaining morning routines and managing busy season with tax clients and dance competitions. Let's start with the monthly stationary subscription boxes. That's still a thing. Yeah, it is. And it's really fun.
This most recent one has like really pretty kind of like sage, great. It's called Archer. It's the Archer and Olive.
I think it's, it's like $15 a month, but it comes with two different types of washi tape pages of stickers and like colored paper and something extra depending on the month and this month that has these little like birds, little like chickadees, I think.
It's just really pretty, but it also helps make it not too difficult to put too much thought or energy into what the design is, but still making it pretty. So I don't feel overwhelmed with, oh my gosh, I need to like make sure that the drawings are perfect.
Like I'll just slap some stickers or washi tape on and it makes me really pretty like it makes it look really pretty, but still, but not too much effort or energy put into it. I like that. I was looking at getting some washi tape and some stickers. I think I was going to look at like Yoseka.
I like Yoseka style. Yeah. And also that's where like a lot of hope and each of stuff is there, but they have like some washi tape rolls and things like that, or I could just get everything at one time. Yeah. That's awesome.
And then the weekly spreads on Thursdays, it sounds like you kind of you touched on that a little bit already, right? Yeah, but I don't do so I do I'm moving him to Fridays, because that's a little bit later, but I'm I also have simplified them. So I don't have weekly trackers.
I don't have some of the like the gratitude or things that I put in in that it's basically just what my schedule is. So it just has each day and then it kind of has just like the schedule of the day. And what what that does is it helps me mentally remind myself what's coming up the next week.
And then I do tend to have a little bit of space for like to write things down, but that's not the priority. I like it. Yeah. Well, we're not done with you yet. Oh, darn it.
The morning routines, you talked a little bit about like your morning routine before that was like your morning pages, but like the morning routine, how did that work out? Yeah, no, it didn't. It didn't. It just didn't.
And the last part was managing the busy season with tax clients and dance competitions. Yeah, little did I know that the this would be my last tax season to do a lot of tax things. And so it's kind of. Yeah. Did I did I. I mean, not maybe I don't know.
So I've moved over into different areas of in my clients companies that I'm managing and it includes not doing text stuff anymore. So we have. I've moved it off to. Like other people to do the stuff. So I get to do more exciting things. That's pretty cool. It's pretty dope.
Well, there's still the dance competitions. And dance competitions. Definitely. We just had our first one last week and I forgot how tired it makes me. So this will be fun. So for me. Yeah, I talked about new job and the restrictions that came with the new job.
Not being able to use many of the apps that I had already paid for and used. Being forced to use different certain tools. Yep. Adapting to companies data protection policies, which I will say were probably not as bad as I made them out to be. And then new hardware.
I got my moonlander keyboard, my iris keyboard. And then using my HoBinichi tech, uh, Tacho, which is open. It's here. And a new mouse. And then, yeah, struggling the balancing new job demands and community management. I'll start with that one.
It again, it's still been a struggle this year, Black Python devs did so good. So proud. We raised close to like $30,000. We sponsored, I think in the end, like 15 or 16 events across the US and Africa. We helped get people to really important conferences for like the first time in their career.
We were just we just found out that we were recognized in one of the communities as like a community service award nominee. We did not win, but we were nominated. So that's great. We held our own leadership summit, which was like the first time we had we had done our own type of event of that size.
Like there were so many things that happened. And the feedback that I got was that I am very hard to work with because I do not. I am I am great at saying I need help. I am very bad at trusting people to the thing. And being very transparent about timelines and things like that.
So I am working to fix that by putting people in between me and some of those decisions so that they can be in charge of that. And I can focus on things that in reality should be on my plate as kind of the executive person on in the community.
Regarding the hardware, I still I still love my keyboards. Both of them I use both of them regularly. I take one of them with me on trips in which I get some goofy looks at first and then people are like, people are like, at least you're not packing an iMac. Oh, yeah, absolutely not.
And on the bright side, people are like, hey, Jake, you take notes because you actually look comfortable while the rest of us are like over here lurched over our laptops. And I'm like, yes, yes, I will.
My hope in each of you, Tacho, is probably the biggest let down of 2024 in my world of productivity. I started out so strong. And then there's a bunch of blank pages and then I got back to it and there's like about a month.
But I think out of the hundreds of pages in here, I would say maybe a quarter of them were populated with content. And there's two thoughts here. There is the like sustainability person in me that was like, this could have been much lighter.
Like you you cut down like you use way more paper than you needed to for this.
There's also a part of me that was like as much as I complained about, you know, oh, I let I switched from my plotter to the open EG because it was like, oh, if I if I have a page or two missing in those days, that says something.
Well, what does it say when there's like a month missing or like, hey, you you wrote in this two times throughout all of June, like that that probably says a little too much. So I did switch over to the Hoanichi cousin for next year.
And I got a larger size and the biggest difference is that the pages are not named so they're not labeled. So I would have to go in and label them. I still get all the calendars. I still get all the other stuff. And I get I got the cover for it.
But more than anything, I fought with with the Hoanichi this year because like I wanted to have a space to put meeting notes and things like that. And I felt like they weren't there. So I was still using my plotter for meeting notes. But then I had my Hoanichi over here.
So I was walking around to notebooks most of the time. In fact, I have my plotter on my desk on the right hand side and my Hoanichi on my desk on the left hand side. So switching to the cousin, I'm hoping that I will. I'm not going to tell myself the lie that I'm going to write in it every day.
But I'm hoping two things will happen. I'm hoping that one I'll have my notes in with my daily pages. I also think that I can utilize some of the weekly planner stuff for a lot of this. And maybe switch to like a weekly planning format instead of a like daily one.
And then also just use those blank pages to kind of be the space in between. And then that'll allow me to play around a little bit with some washi tape and stickers sheets and stuff like that. Because I really do want to get to that point.
I do think that there's something about making your notebook nice and and being happy about it and continuing moving there. Yeah. It makes you want to use it more. Yeah. The major changes with work is a challenge still.
Luckily set up was came in and like so a lot of the tools that I had I was able to use set up to like just keep using them on both devices. I did go and I actually looked for some other devices that were not attached to my iCloud account.
And so in the end I wound up making some different choices on both devices to like fit the setup for a work compatible workflow that I can also take with me to the you know my personal machine. I think that like that's where like tools like ecam and stuff like that came super important.
But that's also why I know the upgrade folks in this last this current episode that came out this week. They were talking a lot about this like hey the Mac got it right about the app store that like it shouldn't be the it can't be the only place where you get your stuff.
I think that now having gone through this period of like 90% of the tools that I use are not on the app store or if they are on the app store there's a way to install them pay for them get them licensed that isn't the app store.
And had they been only on the app store it would have been absolute deal breaker and that I could not use them. Yeah yeah that's a that's a really good point a good way to think about it. I think if I had to wrap up the winter systems check version of J I would I would say like.
I think that's a good point for me to wrap up the winter systems that I use on the like in the middle of it just and just flat in the middle of it again I'm just starting a new job.
I'm not sure what to expect I'm going to go with the flow I'm going to roll with the punches and do the things that I need to do to just make it happen. Yeah I mean same like like I said before you the the future us didn't know what was coming and it's it's poor naive me a share.
Funny well I will kick it off for myself then for episode 76 which was the summer update the summer of no no the summer travel. Yes summer travel absolutely I'm not even going to look at this I will just say episode 76 version of J was tired of traveling because this prob this was in July.
This was probably like right before London and at that time I had already traveled probably five six times that year and it's like I I feel like people are like oh but traveling is so nice and I'm like.
It is when you get to enjoy the travel that's happening most of my travel was going into another room and like talking to nerds which again I like talking to nerds that's what I do I am one of them this is fine.
There there was a lot of things that I would have loved to have done more like going and hanging out with conductors and going to baseball games and things like that by the by this time that's already come and gone and now it's just like I gotta go do this again.
But for that one I was I already noticed the challenges in my Hobanichi. I was back on to do this for some things managing like six active projects at a time and I had basically resigned myself I created an iCloud account for work which is something that they they authorized.
So lead to download drafts and nothing else not have iCloud sync and like just have drafts on my computer because I don't think people realize like I am reading these notes in drafts right now.
I probably could have copy and pasted them and put them in our doc there was just a lot of it so I was like I feel like it would have been harder to follow but like I have 1222 drafts and I actually audit by drafts so I go through.
That's just in the inbox I have another 1300 drafts in the archive wow 2300 drafts total sitting there and this is this is on my personal machine so this is like my personal life is attached to my phone and my laptop there are 2300 drafts that have been created that span all the way back from.
Let's see let's see here October of 2017 wow and most of these are like blog posts but that's okay but that's that's fine so like drafts was like the thing that I couldn't get around I was like I need I need a place to just jot a thing down and then know that I could go back to it later.
 But other than that yeah like I said a lot of the same going back to to do us to do us was the choice purely because to do us didn't require and I cloud account and the unified account meant that I could access tasks on my personal and my work machine which was great they also started playing around with this calendar view thing which I I understand that I am not going to do that.
The promise of it there was a connection that I made a while back that was like I really want to try this time blocking thing it was purely to see if like this calendar thing would even like work for me that's whether it didn't.
The like the value in daily pages for like accomplishment tracking and stuff I don't think I've talked about this enough.
 There are some days when I write in my hope in eG purely because something happened something probably good or bad or whatever you know something happened that was worth writing down sometimes it feels really plain like sweeping in laundry and playing video games and then watching some games and being upset by those games this was.
 January 28th so I'm trying to think of what games will be on in January 28th probably the playoffs yeah probably the playoffs for small yeah but then there are other days that are just like hey I did this workshop also I have this New York meetup coming up and I'm on my first rotation and like a whole bunch of other stuff usually usually.
 When I do get heavy into my notebook it means that there's a lot happening and there's a lot happening that I probably want to go back to and think about some more even if let's be honest do I ever go back to these notebooks afterwards actually I do usually about two or three years later so it's like oh I did do that didn't I but yeah that's that's it for me.
So Kathy let's let's do them together I'm going to read off the things that you said you did and then get your opinion on on what that episode of Kathy looked like okay then we'll go through the pieces that are a little different.
Okay so you continued using the bullet journal system you're using notebook therapy notebook for weekly spreads that's okay so that's a change.
 You created artistic monthly layouts you started using the lychem 1917 for meeting notes you're still using omnifocus successfully and act when you're actively maintaining it okay so maybe that's a question in there and then you're using the Spotify premium for work music and ambiance and planning adaptations for your upcoming trip to Taiwan.
Yeah, where that happened what I didn't but I did what was episode 76 Kathy like 76 Kathy sounds like you know that's a good one. Good vintage. Yeah, 76. Oh excellent good good good year good year.
I there was so much optimism in 76 Kathy so much hope for what that summer was going to be it didn't it wasn't bad but I didn't I wasn't expecting what was going to.
Again you know that the it's the hope that kills you like what was going what was coming in the future was gonna was was starting to weigh down the travel was great it was fun but also. Was going to start layering in that foundation of burnout that was coming.
And then the imposter syndrome also not a great not a great five. Becoming the imposter syndrome if you don't mind no no.
It specifically with okay so this past like going to Taiwan without like being who I am in that I don't really have a blog you know this show doesn't talk a whole lot about you know tech.
 In specific tech and that sort of stuff like I'm not a tech guru and yet I'm going to the show and I'm and I'm listening to people talk and and things that I don't understand but I also I'm like okay this is this interesting yes absolutely I'm so glad that I was able to go I'm glad I learned so many different things including the fact that I am never going to remember a bunch of tech things like that's what I'm going to do.
It's just not how my brain is going to work and again that's okay that's okay. The relay 10 and podcast the thon both had these am I good enough to be here type of a thing.
 Just just working through it and I think this was also a sign of kind of my burnout coming of the amount of energy that I took to do the simple tasks of being myself and doing what I'm wanting to do and being a part of of the groups that I'm in and just being so impressed with these friends and what they're they're able to successfully do and how they're able to.
To be as incredible as they are and and not like and just being like am I a part of that to I guess I am it just just just definitely. Yeah it's been it's been a journey less less less summer 76 Kathy. Had had the the start of what the future was going to bring.
I think from the outside looking in there was a ton of jealousy I wanted to enjoy all of the things that you got to enjoy I wanted to go to Taiwan so badly I absolutely like I believe I remember telling Stephen like Stephen how dare you not invite me to.
 Memphis like I'm a Tennessee and through there and in the end I wouldn't have been able to go anyway right which was such a bummer and like it was one of the things that like I told we again we had these layoffs and we had a new shake up and all this other stuff and in that moment I told my new boss I'm not traveling next year as much as I did this year like don't even pretend.
 And that that is an option like if if my schedule this year or next year looks like it did this year I'm gone I'm out I can't I told them that I couldn't when I joined they pushed me to do it anyway I understand that there is some travel that has to happen I'm not even done traveling this year I have to go again I have to go back up to Toronto for before the end of the year so like there there is this position of like I'm going to be.
 I'm ready for that next stage of my career that doesn't have me on a plane every single month and I need I need that to happen because there are going to be things in my personal life and I consider conduit as a part of my personal life a little bit more than my professional life that all of the things in relay I want to be a part of but I feel like I don't have the space to do them.
And a lot of a lot of like next year's plans are hopefully making space to be able to do them. Yeah I think that's a great that's a great idea it's a great thought.
So yeah I think the only thing that was there was relatively new here fine for looking you had some notebooks you have like multiple notebooks going on what was that about.
Yeah so I changed or so that I have been using this notebook therapy book from December for my monthly spreads and things but using the lychstrom for my meeting notes I've actually switched and I think the net there's one more systems check to to review right.
Yep we got one one last or no this is we've got one this is winter so if we did summer so fall right we've got another one we got 82 yeah yeah 82 so in 82 I'll talk a little bit about kind of the notebook changes that happened but what that the time.
Using the meeting notes I definitely needed more notes note taking for things and it's still kind of in play specifically for the I used it a lot for the book good beta testing notes as well as.
 Writing down things for the game show planning so it's it's kind of more longer term planning things and using my sidekick nook pad for meeting notes because they're usually just a weekly they're done throw them away I don't need to keep them and so the use of having it on just a sheet of paper in a notebook that I take out means that I don't feel a lot of.
And overwhelming obligation to keep things if that makes sense yeah interesting and then you've last piece on this you mentioned Omni focus was successful when you were actively maintaining it but did yeah yeah is there trouble in paradise yeah if you don't use it it doesn't work fair that's fair.
Awesome welcome for that deep deep emotional thing.
Oh don't worry it's my turn um 82 82 let's see this wasn't longer ago this was three months ago we're on 88 or 89 right now yeah so I realize that shortly after that it's like every seven or eight episodes yeah weird how that works yeah you know especially when you actually stick to the schedule.
 Yes so I made significant changes to my development workflow I switched from VS code to just using the command line using a laquerty and the of them I implemented some tools from Brett Brett Terpstra who was a guest on conduit in between that time I switched to a unified theme across all these applications using cat poochine.
 And I returned to using my hope in each of you to show more consistently though I still wish to have more blank pages yeah yeah that that that's like a week um this was this was I'm doing this thing at work where like I'm on this team and it's called medical and like you don't have to worry about any what that means but everyone has like this oh it's so metallic.
Like oh it's like a metal band you know whatever I played drums from medical. So we do this thing where we have like we have some artwork that we use and when we give our weekly updates we do them in the form of like a metal album so all of the previous weekly updates are on the back.
So I'm trying to. That's incredible if I were going to give 82 and out of song title it would be rebirth because there was the changes that I made still still doing so it's still there I'm still in the command line although I'm not using a laquerty I'm using West term which again.
Doesn't really matter I'm still in my command line I'm doing a lot of command line work I've actually implemented more tools to make the command line a better you know experience for me. Some of Brett's tools I didn't mind of using a ton of them but I am using some of them and as we'll get to.
And then this in our current update we will we'll I'm using even more and some of them were inspired by Brett.
Capuchin is still the hotness across all of my stuff I love it I'm going to speak to yes I have a I have a very aqua and pink over Nici Tacho that I love because I like you things yeah like I like you things they make me I use them so like.
 The the Capuchin theme being kind of like neon like the greens and purples and pinks and stuff I love it my it matches pretty well with my Hovinechi although my cousin is like a tan and blue it's like tan and powder blue so still it's still subtle and soft but I like it yeah I am I was really happy with this change and I'm glad that I didn't get.
I'm going to give up on it yeah and that I am continuing to push and do more I'm proud of you yep so what about you let's see. Kathy how would you describe someone who is using new capture tools due to business changes implementing a sidekick notepad and between your keyboard and your monitor and.
Now they're just talking on and on and on about that sidekick notepad they're really interested in that sidekick notepad.
Including a right side for weekly priorities and a left side for notes and capture continuing your bullet journal and your notebook therapy notebook and then recognizing that you might need to clean up your omnifocus a little bit.
Yeah yeah definitely again optimistic optimistic past me hoping for the future the stress of the changes that came into you know how my work was definitely significant level of stress there was a lot of unknowns in that period which definitely helped contribute to the burnout but.
I with all of the changes I made the mistake of thinking that just making small tweaks to how I was working would make me successful enough with getting things done the way that I needed to and truth and matter is not not quite there not not quite accurate and so being being more aware of kind of.
 What was was going to come but the tools the tools the tools are fulfilling the needs that the tools need to fulfill that for for words I think is interesting you mentioned you mentioned some it also caught something in here of saying like emphasizing changing systems only when something isn't working and.
And I feel like that is that wraps up so well kind of the like Kathy is the embodiment of conduit as a whole thing of like this isn't this isn't content creation this is like. It's not like I'm just emphasizing a change because something isn't working.
 Yeah yeah and and it's important it's difficult to be able to acknowledge and recognize when things aren't working and and that level of forgiveness that you have to give yourself of like hey it's okay to make mistakes it's okay for something to not work the way that you wanted it to or that you aren't working the way that you thought that you'd be able to.
And being able to to think really live with that and be okay with that and accept and acknowledge that it's okay. What's okay to make mistakes I know I know weird. Oh it's okay.
Well that leads us to our exist our current systems check but I want to wrap up the notes here with what the key themes throughout the year. Yeah. We're identified as as told to us by Claude both dealt with adapting systems around travel. Which I think is fair.
Yeah you even said so I just tried about it. Yeah. There was a gradual finding of balance between digital and analog tools.
I feel like we went back I think we went like reverse order where you you started very much like Omni Focus and then like one notebook and then one notebook became like five notebooks but Omni Focus is still there.
And then I was like notebook over everything else and then it was like and then this one digital thing that I couldn't use after all and it was like oh well now it's it's digital systems but it's digital tooling not necessarily digital productivity that I had to change.
And then emphasize changing systems based on actual needs rather than novelty yet we just talked about that but while maintaining core tools Kathy with Omni Focus and bullet journaling and myself with my very sparsely populated Hovenechi.
While experimenting with supplementary capture methods and I okay there's there is a type of service that I believe in the very early days we were very well I was very into you were very not into. Remember when we used to use craft for everything. Yes, yes I do. Man that was a choice.
So I bumped into a video for an app called Memento and I was like oh what's this and I was like no don't do it don't do it. And then I sent it to a friend of ours shout out to Jeff Severance Gunsle and I was like Jeff look at this I was like this has to be the dumbest thing I've ever seen.
And he just kind of shared a laugh about it and then just kept it going. So I was like oh that's that's funny.
 Especially because like are the way that we do things now is is different like it makes so much more sense to keep everything in our Google drive because that's where we load our files for a heavy air to edit like why would we why would we split it there's no need to when there's tools involved in the folders that we need to do the things that we need to do.
 I also think that there's like this added benefit of when you have a thing that is tied to other pieces of the system like for those that don't know like we have a Google sheet that tracks all of our of the show names that we it also pulls in the cut the connections and it's so nice to have all of that stuff working together.
 And that was just not a thing that we were going to get in a service unless we had unless we like redesigned all of it and then the people that were helping us with the tooling like they would have to learn the new tooling they would have to learn how to do all these new things it was just like you know what let's just let's just work with what we've got here let's work inside of this space.
And we'll work through the limitations will work is at one point I was like trying to automate the stuff and I was like you know what a right click and duplicate is fine.
Yeah yeah there's there is it cool to add some automations yeah sure it can be great when it but that's the problem is it has to work and if you're spending so much more time trying to make it work instead of just doing it then maybe it's not the best.
Yeah oh speaking of this was the focused on practical solutions. That was like that was the last piece of that. Yeah.
Yeah going in and and just instead of doing it for the Graham or doing it for whatever like what is the easiest way yeah doing it for the talk what is the easiest way to get something done with the least amount of like hiccups or roadblocks or I don't I don't know other other things here.
Other barriers yes yes Kathy what how did you how did you feel about the last year of connections before you you wrap up giving us your much much shorter and much easier to track.
Connections or connections but systems systems yeah I think it's been it's been a rough year as a whole and I think the systems kind of laid that out it was a pretty wild.
Like ride of changes in small increments that if I look at it as a whole oh yeah that's how I was you know that's how it was last year but.
It's it's all in the sense of making changes that work that make it how the the year in my days so whatever ranges that the individual days all the way to the full year can can try and be as not just productive but as easy and happy as possible.
 Yeah I I think it's you know just as we talked about earlier the like going through the notebook just for the sake of going through it to see like what happened I think this was a great exercise of like I wanted to do these things like oh yeah I was using this and you know what this did not work out well.
 Yeah I think having a look at that night and you know Kathy we were talking about my connection from the last week was like using AI for things that are not important I think that these are the things that I do get a little bit excited about when we talk about like AI in a way that is relatively useful is hey make it easier for me to reflect on what happened.
 Make it easier for me to take a look and go like if if it ended every question with how did that make you feel like I'm not saying it replaces my therapist but like I don't think that I could accurately explain all of the changes that happened in my system as well as this did to my therapist I think they were just like talk about it for the last year I'd be like well let me tell you that some sense of the same thing.
 So just a little bit of that extra added context in the form of like hey I'm going to need you to go through the words that I said the hours and hours of words that I spent talking about things that was another thing that I wanted to do was like what would happen if I gave it every single transcript from condo it just be like describe condo it.
I think it would be like what are y'all doing right. It's weird but no I think that going through the last year has been really really cathartic in some ways of being like J you didn't you weren't lost you you might have been slightly insane but like you weren't it wasn't it was tough.
 And you were able to adjust through the toughness you were able to make those adjustments you were able to reflect on like okay these things were happening and you were able to speak up and advocate for yourself I think that's one of the big things that we talk about with this is like you have to be able and willing to advocate for yourself and it comes some things.
But we've got one last connection or not connect you put on connections.
This is the systems check for the year but unlike we usually do in which it would take an entire hour we're going to go through the TMNT of it all Kathy starting with you tools what tools are you using tools I'm using omnifocus or at least I should be using it more often.
But omnifocus is for the repeats the the long term longer term reminders that I don't have the individual pieces of it my bullet journal and the notebook therapy book used for my weekly planning my review and like kind of tracking for the month my sidekick no pad for the notes meaning notes.
Quick to do is that like it I just need to remember because I'm in a meeting I need to write it down real quick I could add them to omnifocus but there's something about handwriting it that works with my brain a little bit easier.
And that's that's it really those are those are the main capture tracking tasky type thing tools that I'm using.
 For me tools are as I mentioned before I'm using was term and zealage but these are just terrible yeah exactly these are these are terminal tools that are just continuing along me being more like deeper and deeper into the command line and building command line things I'm actively building a couple of you know projects that are they weren't meant to be they weren't meant to take on this mind of their own but they did.
Which means that I have to find a team of maintainers for them because I don't want to be just me yeah which will be super super important. The thing of that I haven't really like this is a kind of a looking ahead because I just started playing around with this recently.
Just taking control and taking ownership of a lot of this stuff that I'm putting on the internet again like I don't look at analytics for my personal blog I don't look at analytics for conduit because I don't know that didn't really matter to me.
I'd still be doing the show even if two people were listening like so if in pylix we're listening in our live chat now and I think I saw it in earlier. But I I want I've been looking I have these two raspberry pies sitting here on my desk and I'm like I want to eat.
And they're not moldy no they're not. Hi, somebody. That was like what? Like no Kathy they're like. That was a good one though took me a second but it was a good one. I've debated getting the new Mac mini I have an old Mac mini I could technically use that old Mac mini I just it's just old.
But I I'm considering having like my own little personal server type thing that I run a lot of stuff on. And these are things like bookmarks these are you know I want to be able to have a singular place right now I have like.
Code on one machine code on another machine those those two bits of code are. Not the same in a way that's kind of annoying. And. Some I spend like a lot of time just going all right let me try to get everything on the same page.
But if I had a centralized device if I had a home code server type thing which is very common. I started using tail scale again and that would give me the ability to. Just have one just a singular place where all the things exist. I would probably also invest heavily into back place.
Yeah that would that would be kind of the next thought and it would be great because then I could just record conduit from there it's always set up I'm always you know it's always ready to go. And I would just need to like.
Open it up from time to time and go hey start the show and then do the thing but even then that's tools that's tools let's go to mentality. Kathy how that was your mentors going. Yeah okay yeah let's let's. It's it's getting better so that's part of why I wanted to start doing the mood tracker.
Because again if you if you think too hard about it. All like all I will remember are the vibes of the bad vibes. Okay and how tired or exhausted or burn out or whatever the feeling is. But I'm looking at my mood tracker for November because it today is November 26 so I've got 25 days done.
And there's a lot of the pink color which are smiley faces like. If I was. Thinking harder. Like if I if I just thought about the past month in particular I would think oh my gosh it was terrible because I had a couple of really really bad days.
But overall they weren't that bad that's just kind of what the energy is sticking in my head and I don't love that. I don't love that I want to try and. Get some real data to better help kind of that that mental mental space so.
Those are the tool like that's part of the system that I'm building to try and. Get better at it. Where my brain is. Have you have you played around with the journal app that apple. But out. I had it kind kind of. I don't really why.
I'm just looking at it and one one of the things I do like is that it does kind of bundle a bunch of things so they. I recently went we had a day at the park at the ballpark. And I had a great time and I got some photos of myself and in J.N. like throwing a baseball out on the field.
I was like being able to play catch on the field which was just like this cool moment for both me. J.N. had a fun time. I don't think she knows how much it really meant for like me personally like to be there with her and to be there with Brittany and like doing a thing and.
It was one of those things that I didn't really spend a lot of time. Thinking about. And then I opened the journal app and it was like the first thing that was there and I was like hey do you want to save this as a thing and I was like. You know what I kind of do.
And I'm just kind of looking at all the stuff that was there. And I was like oh this is nice this is fun. I should do this more often I should use this app more often to just spoiler alert for.
So I'm just going to put my connection and the thing I do like about this more than anything is that it does have that like.
Hey how are you feeling right now there is a like you can log mindful entries you can do a mindfulness thing and include it in there and that's like an integration between the health app and stuff.
Yeah not to not to say that you're the paper version is is like better or worse I just think that there's. There are oftentimes we're like if I were to look back and been like October how was October I was like I was sick half the time it was a gross I didn't like it.
And then I'm like oh let me go through some of these photos and they were like well. You know hey you have that phone call and then you did that other thing and then you like you know you went to get to go to the baseball park and that was really cool.
And like you did all this stuff that I wouldn't have thought about it would honestly it would have been hard for me to even if I logged it in my Hovenechi it probably would have been hard for me to think of the like.
It would have taken longer to find the individual pieces that made it as cause it was and again a lot of that is just the fact that I don't use it like that I probably should it would have been great if I did. But I don't know I think that's a that's a that's a good idea maybe.
Yes, spoiler alert for for my connection that I'm not going to talk about so nevermind. La la la la moving on. Okay my mentality was was basically just that. I'm at a point now where it's like can't be bothered.
Let's see I am excited about what I'm doing I'm indifferent about where I'm going and ultimately next year is a next year we'll have to be pivotal for my career.
I mean pivot like pivotable like in there there has to be a pivot in some way well there it will be a pivot in some way either in a direction that I am currently moving in with the slight adjustment or in a new direction.
I'm again just the amount of travel that I did this year on things that I necessarily didn't want to do was just too much it was too high and I need to choose that I want to I want to be available to do. St.
Jude things I want to be available to do you know hey magic trip to Taiwan let's go right like I want I. I will be your translator for all of the things technological to just like what are the talking about it's not important.
But yeah I want to have more of that new joys Kathy what's a new joy that you have.
 So I've been using the finch app and this might go under tools to but it is what do they what do they call it what it's a like it's an app that's kind of meant to be like self carrying and like supportive and helpful for things but also a little bit of a social media little bit of gamification a little bit of a little bit of everything first off it's very cute.
You get this you do like little creature like a bird little bird that that goes on reminds me to drink water and goes on adventures and and connects with friends and stuff.
And even though sometimes I'm like just cheating myself way through it like oh yeah I totally washed my face today yeah it does have some good reminders and it's it's. Giving my some ideas on how to be nicer to myself if that makes sense.
I mean when this app looks adorable it's so freaking cute right I was like it's it's kind of overboard on the cuteness I don't know.
Like there's nothing wrong with that no no not at all I'm I was like wow this was a choice this is this is the new they knew their target market yeah I almost said like 19 year old Japanese.
I don't think that's the actual market but I'm sure that the call by a market is very happy there they're very there that's really cool I like that my new joy is my new 3d printer.
I got the Kathy I'm not going to lie to you there was a moment when you message me and you said hey the add the advertising dollars came in yeah like I stopped and I was like do I buy a third 3d printer.
I am so happy with this printer it's the bamboo labs a one it prints in multiple colors in fact don't tell one of our neighbors like Jans like bestie that lives in our neighborhood but she's a big Pokemon fan.
So I 3d printed her a Pokeball shaped advent calendar that I've been putting I've been putting together like it's it's super corny I'm gonna I'm sending you a photo of it now it is. Do do do.
But inside of them inside of each of the little containers there will be a little 3d printed Pokemon in each one of the containers and I'm I'm just like I have.
I get I used to shrug off the like oh you know 3d printers are for like printing toys and you're putting more plastics into the world even though these are plant based plastics.
And they are made out of recycled materials but there is like a whole lot of like this is a toy this isn't or this is a waste but like to me it it feels very much like a joy machine where I can spend 4 or 5 passive hours while I'm doing.
So I can do something else and then all of a sudden there's this new thing that exists that someone can be really excited about. That's awesome. So yeah I'm really happy with my my new toy my new joy the bamboo a1 3d printer. Kathy the sad one what are what are the trepidations do you have.
I okay so my job career. Main client transition stuff things it's there's a lot of new things a lot of of changes coming in. I'm that imposter syndrome's hidden real good but I know I can do these things like that's not it's not a problem. I believe in this.
I know I can do it and but it's still stressful so I'm I don't know what my work life looks like in the next year and that's a little stressful but I'm going to do my best. I trust that you can do it. My trepidation is I feel like I'm not saving any money.
Like now I feel like my life is getting expensive. We've had some layoffs that have hit I've dodged all the layoffs so far but I also worry that if I were to not dodge a layoff. The I don't think I would be it wouldn't be catastrophic but it would be detrimental to our lifestyle.
So I definitely think that there's like a hey we should probably be we should be putting some money back just in case like we should be not we shouldn't be getting comfortable with where we are currently because I think where we are currently is probably not the most sustainable place to be.
Yeah I can see that. Safe thing to do. Yeah well Kathy this was a very long systems check but I like it for once a year this is fine. Yeah I'm okay with it. I hope other people enjoy this.
I would also encourage people to think about where you've been throughout the year break it down into the seasons. If you want to look at our systems checks is your guideline like use that to look at where you're going where you've been.
There's a part of me that I don't know how we would do it Kathy but I really really want to go through like all of the connections for the last year and be like here's how things went.
Wow for myself not for everyone else I'm not going to be looking at pillix and being like how many times was there. Yeah I like that idea that can be fun. Yeah but no this is this is great this is this has been a great last normal episode of the year. Yeah chaos is coming.
Chaos is coming but before the chaos we've got one last round together of connections for the year so. Kathy what's your connection my connection is going to be to try out the apple journaling app.
I'm going to see it with this does was that we're going to be yours to yes yeah yeah well that's your fault for having me go first so. No I think that's okay I think that is a great one.
I am going to say when you won't hear from me for a few weeks several weeks due to travel and stuff listeners of the show so the next one will be just Kathy at our amazing guest but I am.
You can do the same thing especially since we're not talking about it no because I feel like the way that I would do it is I'm going to use it like once a week and then use it to kind of recap all the things that happen that week but I would like to. I would like to finish the.
MVP of the app that we're not app of the little tool that I'm making because for real I wanted to get it done two weeks ago and it didn't it just didn't happen.
 Well yeah that's the exact thing that these are meant are meant to be yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep what about our conductors yeah so our artists of the show Carly's new connection is to keep working I can't think of anything else and really you're you're adjusting to a new job that absolutely is an acceptable option to do.
And our checklist enthusiasts of the show Mike says start brainstorming the yearly theme for next year Kathy will it be the year of joy to. No no won't be for me either no no well weird are soprano of the show debos as next connection schedule tree pruning tree. Well that.

Our chief safety of the show Andrew says new connection key my effort on workflow while remembering that it will never be finished or perfected it simply needs to be adapting and progressing got to keep the tires on and rolling that is a really really good reminder.
That there's some things that don't get finished and that is absolutely okay and and and it's not a failure at all. Yes our shark of the show one pair shoes says my connection for next time is to write a blog post about why I went.
Cross country to adopt to cats I get asked why a lot I went that far for getting.
 There's a story there and no there not out of cats in the shelters where I live I mean I remember asking those exact same questions but also I was told that like oh hey there's this letter of like hairless kittens that is cheaper than usual but I would have to drive to like Arkansas to go pick them up to pick one up and I was like you want a kitty absolutely and I want to name him Grimlin or something that I can look at and go well at least I'm not as ugly as you.
Oh wow that is that is that is a very you statement honestly that is very very. That's almost the reason I wanted to plug.
Oh my goodness if pugs weren't like pugs have like it's a very interesting problems that we won't go into here but I have a lot of health issues I was like what was like well it could be worse like it looked like that.
Our fish bear of the show fishy guys says get my sleep back onto into a reasonable schedule oh yeah goodness yes good luck.
 Yeah our car of all trades the show Carl says I'm guessing this is finally get around to changing the breaks of my wife's car and maybe pillacks is oil in his car which probably will end up looking like that one episode of Malcolm in the middle also start looking for people to help me judge a state level code coding contest I'm running in April as a part of a larger organization.
