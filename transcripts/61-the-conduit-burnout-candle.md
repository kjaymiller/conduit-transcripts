From Relay FM, you're listening to Conduit. The show we conduo our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that will never give you up, will never let you down. This episode is brought to you by Micro.blog.
I'm Jay, I'm back, it's been great, and with me is the person that ain't ever left, except for those other few times where she actually did leave. The one Kathy Campbell, hey, Kathy. Hi, Jay, I missed you.
I had a lot of fun, but I also had a lot of, it wasn't fear of missing out, but fear of being left out, I guess, of the fantastic conversations that you had.
And I am glad to be back, even if I am getting on a plane again in a week, but it shouldn't involve, it shouldn't interfere with our regularly scheduled programming. So we should be good. Excellent. Excellent.
Speaking of regularly scheduled things, Kathy, what happened in our regularly scheduled daily time in the discord? So this past week has been all Halloween, all the time, as we are recording this, it is October 31st, because we record two days ahead of the day that it goes out.
We've got all sorts of chaos and tapes going on in the discord, which is, in my opinion, the best way to celebrate any holiday is with other friends and nerds. And our server banner is hilarious because Stephen, co-founder, Stephen went in and it's a thing.
It's a choice that was made, including using the word art generator on the internet. And yeah, it's beautiful. But if you're not a member of the discord, you can't see it. And I'm sorry, and sad, but maybe next time.
And in our also scheduled, this is actually a more regularly scheduled thing, our co-working session that we do in the off weeks. We and our superconductor friends talked about some new things that I bought while I was away.
One of them, in particular, being the Meta-Sill, which is a metal pencil with metal lead that writes any races like a regular pencil. We also talked about the conversion between 10 miles or 10,000 kilometers. That is inaccurate. But totally the same thing. Totally the same thing.
Conversions are hard. I don't know if you can hear this. Probably not. But I have my Meta-Sill pencil with me right now. I was going to ask. Shut up yesterday. What do you think so far? I really like it. It's got a really solid tip. I got one for Mini Soup as well, and they were so excited.
Minus pink, of course. And I've added it into my daily planning stuff, which is a whole different conversation for our systems track that's going to happen next week. Oh yeah. Our next episode. I mean, not next week. But yeah, it's a happy end of October. Yeah, I do appreciate the smoothness of it.
It's firm but smooth, which is so nice. It's not scratchy, which is really nice. And it races really easily, even through highlighter, which is nice. And yeah, I'm very pleased. I'm very pleased. Don't worry. There will be a link in the show notes to the option, the location that I got it.
It will also help you spell it correctly, which will then allow you to do a search in Amazon or your favorite pencil place of choice. I don't know. Just do a Google search and you'll find it. Yep.
And if all that conversation sounds like fun, or if you have better self-control than we do, where you can hear people talk about fun things that they got and not immediately want to rush out and buy them for yourself, you should join us in our next co-working session. We do them in the off weeks.
So whenever there is an a conduit, there's a fun little conversation we're having with our friends. And you can join us by becoming a super conductor. That's what we call the people that give us money because we think they're super and they think they're conductors because they are.
But if you want to learn more about that, visit letter i letter m letter a super conductor dot com and become a member today. That's I'm a super conductor dot com. Don't don't spell the word letter out. That would be a problem. No, that would be weird.
Yeah, but it is letter i letter m letter a super conductor dot com and become a member today. Hey, hey, Kathy, hey, Kathy. Hey, hey, Jay. I know how much you love shouting. So why don't you give some shout outs? Wow.
Does that say something about me as a person that I get angry? Is that what you're employing? I'm really confused. But either way, huge shout out to Erica for being such an incredible guest host. Erica, how dare you be so amazing. Right.
She just, I mean, came in like the professional that she is, but brought such wonderful energy. And we have been so lucky with all of our guest hosts on this show. As much as I love our relationship, it's nice to add a little bit of extra extra little zing when I can't have my J.
I'm not touching that topic. Yeah, yeah, good idea. But yeah, what about you? What do you have to shout about? So I wanted to shout all of my shout outs. However, the media training and how to use a microphone just refuses to let me. So I'm going to say it in the most stern voice possible.
Shout out to Roboism and Overtired for being amazing shows and letting me join them for their regularly scheduled programming. Both of the episodes are out now. As always, Overtired does talk about mental health and things. And also language.
So if you're sensitive to those things, maybe you don't listen or you don't listen in the car with your kids. But how dare you not have already listened to it? I'm angry. I'm just kidding. I can't even do an angry shout out. Right.
But you know, shout out to Alex for inviting me to be on Roboism while Kathy was away. And then to Brett Terpstra and Christina Warren for guessing on Overtired and maybe teasing a new co-hot. No, we're not starting. We're not perpetuating the myth that I am replacing anybody on that show.
I cannot do that. I am physically incapable of producing at that quality on such a regular basis. Yeah. Good. Because I'd hate for you to leave me for real. I mean, just because I would go and do another show to Sophie, I have to give up one. Although that is what happened last time. Yeah. Yeah.
Enough about that. It's time for connection checks. Zap. Hi, Kathy. You had to redo some cables. I did. It was real bad. But I did it. I did it on Sunday. So not even like last minute. I've got a big green check mark for me because it's done.
I can put my feet up without like getting them tangled in cables. I also, so I had purchased an external, like hub just for power because I have like my MagSafe charger and my Apple Watch charger that don't need to be connected to the computer. They just need power. So I went through. I did that.
I also moved over my ring light to be powered in that. So all to all, all to all. I don't know. All in all. All in all. There we go. All in all, feeling real good. I also did clean my desk or at least three quarters of it. So feeling really great about that. Nice.
What about you? So I'm trying to, I had to do computer stuff, folks. And now my computer's all in a tizzy. I'm trying to add the emoji on. And my brain is used to doing it one way. And it's not working right now. I had a green check mark. I wanted to do a green check mark followed by orange circle.
So in the time that I was gone, I had, I've given two conference talks and I have one more to go. The two that I gave went really well. And the connection check that I had was for the one that I just gave last week. It was called Python versus Hip Hop. It is one that I am absolutely.
I was so excited to give. It went very, very well. And I got a lot of good compliments. I have people that are asking me to present it at another conference as well. Like all the good things happened. And now I have arguably the biggest presentation of my career coming up next week.
And it's actually like an open discussion style thing, which has me a little uneasy. I don't like worst case scenario. I just do a bad job. Best case scenario. I knock it out the park and everybody thinks I'm like super awesome. It's not even a like jar situation here.
It's more of a like, this is a new format for everyone. Like the conference that's doing this is never done this before. They don't know what the turnout is going to be. And like the way that they've had us prepare for this is in a more traditional sense. As if I were talking just at the audience.
And they really want to encourage me to have like open discussion with the audience in a very comfortable setting, which is very different levels of preparation. So a level of like social interaction that normally isn't invited into my talks that I have to open to.
So like there's no level of like is the talks prepared? Yes. Is there mental preparation that could be done? I genuinely don't know, which is, which is why I wanted to do a green check of that I did do all the stuff. I did the stuff that I said I would.
But also like I genuinely don't know how to successfully do this thing. Okay. Well, I mean, it sounds to me that you did it. So I don't know what to tell you. I think you should go with your heart and you have the check mark.
And you should not worry about trying to figure out how to do an orange circle emoji, even though you did, but we're going to pretend that you didn't and just leave it there. So what you're saying is I should listen to my heart. Yes. I don't know the rest of the lyrics. Sorry. That's all I had.
That's all I had. What about our conductors? Our conductors did amazing this fortnight. Our nameless of the show nameless has a red pushpin. Although I attempted to find new ways to accomplish my work, I often felt overwhelmed and ended up returning to my usual routine.
Perhaps this means that I've already discovered my ideal system and simply need to expand upon it or maybe I chose the wrong conduit for restructuring. Nonetheless, I will continue to work on this, but for now it is a red pin. I don't know.
But in my opinion, it sounds like it's kind of at least a yellow because you learned something new and to me that is the most important part about these connections. Yeah, the more you know, I forgot how this show works.
Our identical twin of the show, Aaron says, connection check, green check mark, I had a lovely time off and things went mostly smooth, despite not having any firewood for the first night. But hiking in the fall colors made it all worthwhile.
I was going to say something about do you really need a fire, but then also it's going to be 40 degrees tonight where I met. So like very well, I understand. And I'm glad that you had some good time off. I wish we had a fireplace. You're going to say I wish we had time off.
I mean, that's what you're talking about. The Canadian trivia card enthusiast of the show Erica says connection check, red question mark for my trainer who never sent me my program, but green check mark for me because I emailed them twice to follow up and kept up with yoga in the meantime.
Heck yeah, that's a double green check mark in my brain. I have to, I can't wait to see Erica again to forget to talk about this, but my wife is having a similar issue where like having to reach out to someone every single day for them to do the thing that they said that they were going to do.
Yeah, art the lassofile of the show ponders says connection check red X my desk is not clean. That's okay. Neither is mine. So it's a mess. I'm a mess. We're all mess. Hey, our soprano of the show debos says connection check green circle or green heart. Wow, I know my shapes. I do.
That's a green heart got the guest bedroom and bathroom ready for my parents visit, which was successful. Hurray our shark of the show one pair of shoes says my connection was to check what my brain check work bag to see if all right.
Okay, I'm going to try to try to speak on behalf of one pair of shoes here. I think there were some changes that they got made later. My connection was to check if my work bag. Nope, couldn't do it either.
My connection was to check my work bag to see if I am hauling around stuff that I'm not using that are just weighing me down. Perfect. Okay. Green check mark. I think I took about three pounds of unneeded stuff out, including a power brick for a work computer that I turned in last summer.
Definitely don't need that. Nope. Yeah, nope, but good job. Good job. Three pounds does make a significant difference if you're carrying it around all the time. Yes. Our tire advocate of the show, Chinthas says connection check green check mark.
I overachieved and managed to have good conversations with four people. What? I am aiming for three that I met in person for the first time last week. Congratulations. That's amazing. Do I even know four people? It like in person? Yes. Oh, that I don't know.
I do because I know way too many people, local people. Oh, okay. That's all other story. I preface this with I have a new microphone. I don't know how it's going to sound. Our mountain toilet of the show, loging, says green check mark.
We consider our idea and still like it, but life got hectic so it got no further. That's okay. That's that's okay. Our panda of the show James says connection green check mark relaxation has been mostly successful. All my software has been released with no major disasters as of yet.
So I've mostly been seeing people in person reading some fun books and playing games. 324 hours in Starfield and counting. I can thoroughly, thoroughly recommend taking a break if you can. James. Yes. James, I need you to explain Starfield to me.
Is there a way that we can we can talk about start I have Starfield? I haven't opened the game yet. I don't know why not. I just haven't opened it yet. But yeah, maybe you can help me with that and I can get my first hour in Starfield and then begin the counting.
And our fish bear of the show, Fishy Kai says green heart. We as a family relaxed. It's amazing what a few solid night sleep will do. I haven't had a few solid night sleep and how old is my daughter. Yeah, that that long. That's my ears. This episode of conduit is brought to you by micro dot blog.

And because my computer is a hot mess right now, and I'm just going to go with one I know and that I'm practicing which is Portuguese and that is Alburogado. Kathy Kathy Kathy Kathy Kathy Kathy Kathy Kathy Kathy.
Is it just me or do you smell something burning? Oh, wait, no, that's a that's a warning. Oh dear. So I tried to segue into talking about the warning signs of burnout while I also just gave a minor PSA about the warning signs of having a stroke. Yeah. Yeah.
Take take that and just store that in your in the knowledge centers of your brain, which I guess are all of them.
But yeah, I love the topic point here point when why is burnout bad? And I'm like, wait, are we actually asking this?
 Listen, no, this is like, I just want, okay, the reason I put this as a topic, I'm going to go with the point here is because there's some people that aren't aware of what burnout actually is and why it can affect the larger concern, shall we say, like why it's not just why it's bad because obviously people know that it's bad, but like why it's important to try and catch it early.
How about that? Yeah. And psychology today for those that don't know defines burnout as a state of emotional mental and often physical exhaustion brought on by prolonged or repeated stress, though it's most most often caused by problems at work.
You can also appear in other areas of life, such as parenting, caretaking or romantic relationships. So that being said, this is interesting, Kathy, because I, the conference that I spoke at last week, one of the talks that came right after mine was dealing with burnout.
And this is a, this is a thing that people know that they're experiencing, but they often are like the other person in the Deadpool movie where they're like, hey, you're kind of wondering how I got here.
And what I've, you know, we both came up with this topic, which is probably a indicator of something that should be addressed somewhere. No, I'm sure it's fine. I'm sure it's fine. We both want to talk about burnout today.
I, I've started noticing and this started happening a few years ago where I started keeping record of all the things that often indicate burnout for me.
And I was wondering, Kathy, do you do the, do you do the same thing? Like, do you know, do you see the early warning signs that maybe burnout is on the way? I am trying, I'm trying to become more self-aware of where my mental health is and part of that includes being aware of burnout.
Like Laura says in the discord live chat, this is a big topic in the medical world. And I can absolutely see that it shouldn't have taken a worldwide pandemic to get burnout for the medical industry to kind of pay attention to burnout. But I know, I know it's, it's, yeah, it's there.
So I, my problem is my, you know, so the end of November is Ryan's stroke of versory as we call it. And it will be 13 years since the stroke came and like completely changed our life.
And so in that time, a lot of it has been kind of a consistent state of burnout, of like pre burnout, of like a trauma response being ready to, to make adjustments and be very agile in like my day to day state of things, which is exhausting.
And over the past few years, things have been so much more stable that I'm able to recognize maybe when things are getting to the point where I need to take a little bit more of a break on things.
When I'm grumpy or when I'm like very, by the like reactive in a somewhat angry way, or if I have a lot of like mental frustration where I don't want to deal with anything, where I'm like a effort type mindset. And I'd like to, I'd like to figure out the signs before it gets that bad.
 And part of that is I'm trying to do my self care things, not just, you know, face, mass and baths, but like my morning journaling and brain dumping and like getting, getting things processed and out of my head so that I can see it on the page, on a page, and realize that, okay, this is an indicator of there's too much going on, or something similar.
And being able to, I think kind of track those things. So what I'm kind of hoping to do is, is have like a, maybe like an energy tracker or something, to see how I'm feeling at the end of the day. A lot of my like work prep stuff happens at the beginning of the day, which makes sense.
But being able to kind of know how the day went, is a little bit better.
 Yeah, I, I thought about this kind of in the terms of, you know, you hear this thing like, what is a burn out like in a car, which is just your tires are spinning, and you're just burning tread, and you're not going anywhere, which is great, because we have an excellent metaphor that you heard great.
Acronym for tire. Which is your time, your intuition, your resources, and your energy, pick up the stickers today at Yukonwear.com. But the, the feeling of like, I'm burning out, like my tires are burning out, my time is disappearing. I'm not trusting myself.
I feel like I don't have the resources that I used to have, and I just am drained of all energy. And I have gone nowhere. Like that is, that is like the, the definition of the mental state of burnout. And also the physical like, you have burned out all of your tire.
And now it makes it harder for you to actually get traction in the future. Yeah. I, I also, I have like chronic burnout tendencies that are very unhealthy. I stop cooking. I stop eating. I start spending money via retail therapy. I stop communicating.
And I start doubling and tripling down on personal projects. And let's just talk about what's happened in the last year. I've started an online community. I've continued to podcast. I have converted a podcast into a YouTube channel where I have, you know, been randomly interviewing people.
I've spent hundreds of dollars on this equipment to do these things at for literally no fiscal benefit whatsoever. I am doing my best work in the terms of community management and community like engagement.
But at the cost of doing nothing, at the cost of like looking at my job and just being like, I've been working on the same project for four months. And the last two months, I've really felt like there has been zero movement on it.
I am while I am showing up for work, I don't feel as if I am present. I've become very irritable, publicly, I won't say aggressive or hostile. But like the things that I don't like at work, I am not as as tactful as I normally would be towards them.
I would just say this is dumb or this isn't going to work or why are we thinking about this or whose stupid idea was that? I'll need to figure out it was a mine. So like all of these things have been happening. All of these things are present. And it's like, I am in an active state of burnout.
To the point where like at one point my boss was like, you know, you can take like time off. And I was like, yeah, you're right, I could. I'm not going to, but I could. You should. And again, this is the lie that we tell ourselves, there's too much stuff to do.
Yeah, I feel like this might be a conversation after after the call because here's the thing. If you are burnt out to the point where you are not able to do anything, then taking even taking half a day, half a day is still taking time off.
And we'll not ruin like other people's lives, which I know is a big like mental issue. But more importantly, you will probably get more done after you like come back from a break. Then if you didn't take a day off. Yeah. And I absolutely agree with the like you have to take breaks.
I think the problem that I run into at this is that we hit seasons and we're about to go into the slow season. So it's like if I can just hold on. Like I know that, you know, when this comes out, it'll be November.
We've got three weeks until, you know, let's celebrate by arguing with family members over politics and eating a lot of food that makes us sleepy and overweight. And then after that, like until like the middle of January, there's nothing to do. Like I can have that break. I can look at my balance.
I can readjust and do the things necessary. But until then, it's like everybody is asking for things. And it's not that I don't have the time, the intuition, the resources or the energy to do them. It's that I can't get the ball moving. I can't get going.
And what was interesting was this was a similar feeling that came up when I first got diagnosed with ADHD was I was I was fighting burnout. And then I got to the point where like I was so burned out that I knew exactly what to do step by step. But I couldn't do it.
And I don't know why I couldn't do it, but I couldn't do it. And that's again, the lie that I tell myself is that like, okay, you've got like three more weeks, three more weeks of just surviving, three weeks of just spinning the tires. And then you can relax for the next like two and a half months.
Works going to be slow. You've got a couple of projects that are going to be very low impact that will allow you to catch up. Like you can do this. But meanwhile, like everything else is just like on fire. Except for all the stuff that I'm using, I'm doing as a distraction.
I've noticed that my productivity in those areas have peaked. But those don't pay the bills. No, but it's important. I think the hard part in this situation is that you know what you need to do. You know, you need to take a break.
And yet the excuses that are given, like clearly you're taking a break because you're doing this stuff that, you know, like you said, the stuff that doesn't pay the bills, but does like make you happy.
And if you did even a couple days of that to try and reset your brain, could you come back and not because my concern is the waiting until the slow season is going to put you past the point of being able to recover in a healthy way.
You're going to be so desperate that by the time you finally caught up, it's going to be time for the busy season again. Yeah. I genuinely think that taking time off to do the other things isn't recovery. It's, no.
Yeah, it's like just pushing it off to the side and going like, okay, hey, this house is on fire. I will go to the apartment next door while I watch the house continue to burn. I mean, I think the real solution is to to do kind of what I'm doing.
And I'll, you know, talk about a little bit of some of the stuff that I'm doing. But first, I want to ask you like what, you know, you have, you have things that are causing burnout that can't be avoided, that can't be ignored.
Like how are you getting around those things? By trying to make sure that, so the things that I can't say no to in my life, the burnout situation that comes from, you know, other things, I'm trying to find ways to communicate, because communication is key.
Trying to find ways to communicate to other people in my life that can support, but also trying desperately to find the times that I can try to do at least mini breaks. I mean, I finished a Assassin's Creed Mirage. It's done. I beat it. I'm now going back to Valhalla to try and do that.
It's not as fun as Mirage. I might like do Mirage again. I don't know.
I don't know, but trying to find, you know, these moments where I'm not on my phone, I am at like cross stitching or reading or playing video games, like trying to do whatever my brain wants to do, to try and get like that, that kind of reset self.
And by taking these mini breaks, it's allowing me to sustain further, if that makes sense, to push burnout out just a little bit more. So I'm not quite to that point, but it's definitely there.
And so, you know, just I'm also trying to like restructure my mornings to kind of be a little bit more selfish. And it's kind of working. Yeah, Laura says, keep the burnout to a candle instead of a bonfire. Exactly, exactly.
Because again, like you said, there's certain things that I can't say no to that I cannot, because when it's not work, it's more difficult to shut down, if that makes sense. Yeah.
See now, now I have to immediately go and check like Cotton Bureau, our merch provider, to see if they have candles, because a burnout candle. Yes. Maybe that'll be a t-shirt design. Yeah. It's like keep it. Yeah. We'll make sure Laura will be like dash Laura, like keeping my burnout to a candle.
I love it. Maybe at least a sticker. Yeah, the burnout candle. We need burnout-centered candles. Oh my gosh. We'll do the campfire vibes. Yeah. Yeah. I like it. No, I think all of that makes sense.
You know, if you can't avoid it, you can't avoid it, but at least try to get everything else around it so that it, like that's less of, it's not stress added onto existing stress. It's just the stress that it is. The constant state of stress. Yeah.
I'm trying a rather radically different approach that feels a little, I don't even know what the phrase is, a little aggressive. Okay. So I'm participating in No Spin November, where we spend $0.00 and 0 cents on new things to add to the house that isn't like food and necessity. Yeah. Yeah.
So no frivolous spending. No, I saw this and immediately had to get it. Yeah. I kind of tried to do that in October and clearly fail. As I came back with... I lasted the first half of the month, so that's pretty good. Yeah. My hope is that we can go throughout the month.
This is actually probably smart because we still have holiday shopping and like we're having things giving at our house, which means that there's a lot more food. Yeah. And luckily this show comes out after November has already started.
So folks can't be like, I got to spend all my money before November starts. Right. But yeah. So No Spin November is a part of that, which I'm hoping will allow me to take inventory on some of the things that I currently have and appreciate them. Yeah.
There's also the realm that is making sure my physical health is in as good of shape as it can be. I've been seeing a rheumatologist and a pulmonologist in my primary care physician. And then now I have to go see orthopedic physician to check.
And I want to make sure that one my health is in like I understand where my health is that. I have a good picture of it. And then I'm going to give myself the tough bleep, do it anyway, treatment on self care, which is going outside. And this is this is going to be my connection.
So spoiler, I'm going to go outside. I'm going to walk. It does not matter how cold it is. I'm going to get fresh air. I'm going to like I'm going to do the things that like I know I don't I hate the fact that they work that doesn't change the fact that they work. So just do them.
And if I don't want to do them again, tough bleep, just do them. And then beyond your merry way.
And I'm hoping that by pushing myself in some of these, I guess, more aggressive ways, that will help me more than a new productivity app will more than, you know, headspace in the morning for five minutes, although I'm doing that too. And more than just wallowing in my own misery. Yeah.
I think I think that's a that's a great, a great kind of reframing. I'm just I'm just tired. Just tired. I don't know what else to do. I don't know.
It's so the rest part is is being is difficult to like having to yeah, I need to I need I need so last week I went to the co-working space and that was great because I was able to kind of concentrate on just myself for a bit.
Every Tuesday, I've been when I drop mini soup off for dance class, I go to my favorite little bar and talk to my new bestie Megan for two hours. We just sit, I have a drink and hang out and those are really like nice moments in my day. Um, and I look forward to them.
So I almost think I need to try and find like something every day that I can look forward to to help it make make it to where it's it's feeling like there's a positive thing to look forward to almost. I I don't know what that is. I don't know what it looks like. I don't know.
Yeah, I don't know what it is, but I definitely well, especially since my I finished my video game.
So I don't have that to look forward to and I'm not really reading a book that I really am like passionate about, you know, I'm still reading, but it's nothing that I'm like, oh my house, I gotta get I want to get to bed to read.
And so like trying to find find something to look forward to each day, I think will be really helpful. And yeah, in the in the in the live stream, they're talking about, you know, finding small nice moments in a sea of negativity is hard, but vital. Hmm. Well, I've already given away my connection.
So what's what's yours going to be? I I think I need to find find something for each day to look forward to something that's a little bit different. It doesn't have to be special.
 Like it doesn't have to be extravagant, but like I can have Wednesdays or ice cream for dinner days or something something silly, but fun that I can then like keep it have it be like this is the day of the week that I do this to see if I can maybe have something that's a little bit more good to look forward to.
I like it. What about our conductors? Yeah, our nameless of the show nameless says next new connection prioritize completing the unfinished projects around the house before the holiday season.
My wife and I have several projects that we have left in the state of good enough, and it is important to us to finish them before the chaos of the holidays in Sioux.
Additionally, we want to ensure that we have listed our major purchases in preparation for the upcoming sales events such as Black Friday or like sales November.
Lastly, as my wife's birthday falls in December, I want to hide the purchases of her birthday and the Christmas gifts within the upcoming weeks. So she doesn't have any clue as to what her gifts are. That's so exciting. So exciting. Good luck. Our identical twin of the show.
Aaron says new connection. We had some teams shuffle around at work. So I'm on a new team and I want to wrap up some ongoing things over the fortnight and come up with come and come to my new manager and teammates with some thought out plans for a couple of future projects we're looking at.
I think that's great. I think they'll be super awesome. Our pathologists of the show Laura, new connection try very hard to not feel like I'm in crisis mode every day at work.
Do one thing at a time and practice being okay with absolutely everything not getting done in a day will likely require many deep breathing exercises. Yeah, I feel you there and I wish you the best of luck. And our Canadian trivia card enthusiast of the show, Erica says, start my new job on Monday.
Congratulations. And the extra gentle with myself all week, leading up to and following my first day. Why do the easiest sounding tasks often end up being the hardest to do? I mean, you're not wrong, but you can do. Heck, yes. I'm breaking things. It's fine.
Our artists of the show, Carly, new connection. I want to build up my portfolio so I can improve my odds of getting a job. I want to find a person to build a website for and I need to post on social media offering my services or somewhere like a private forum.
Sounds to me like you need to visit our self-promotion channel in the discord, Carly. I know you remember so you can go hang out there and see if you can find someone to help. And our the last file of the show ponders says, clean my desk. I should probably do that too. Next time.
Our soprano of the show Debos says next connection, do some more closed sorting, at least one drawer bag or pile. You can do it. And our shark of the show, one pair of shoes says next time figure out my work goals for next year. That's a lot of goals. I suggest breaking them up into conduits.
And these sorts of tasks have always been challenging for me. Planning for a year is definitely a challenge. One, you can do it. Two, if you can't conduit try breaking up those challenges into maybe some smaller batches. But I think that you can do it.
If you think that you can do it, I think that you can do it. Oh my god, sorry. Oh, big young of the show. Just big young. Big young of the show. Our tire advocate of the show, Tintas, next connection. My manager has unexpectedly had to take an indeterminate amount of time off work.

I'll hop on the no spin of him for a bit. Okay. I feel like Logan and I feel like I am Logan. But I don't realize that I am Logan. Logan, I'm going to need you to show up to a co-working session just to prove that you're not me. Yeah, I've never seen the two in the same space.
There will be spider man pointing. Our panda of the show, James says new connection. I need to get back to doing some work with my apps for the Apple Vision Pro. No, I don't have one. I promise. But I'm not going to overdo it. Good. Sorry. I'm going to not overdo it is how you put it.
It's like I'm going to overdo it. Our fish bear, the show fishy guy says we demolished our freezer meals the last couple of weeks. So it's time to restock. There you go. I like it. That sounds great.

And we have a new connection from a new person who does not have a name of the show yet, but they they have assured us that they will be thinking about it for the next time. So we're just going to call them Justin. Yeah, good one.
But for that, they want to prioritize more branding and revisiting the productivity workflow. Life's been a rollercoaster as of late. And they've considered themselves a productivity nerd, always organizing tasks, which turns out to be how they inadvertently managed their ADHD. Hey, we can relate.
Literally being diagnosed as we speak. So back to the grind of taking baby steps to get my mind in check. Oh, that's a lot. That's a lot. Okay. Yeah. I congratulate you in the process of learning more about yourself. How you've you've managed to manage yourself for a long time.
And I sincerely hope that just to be to be somewhat realistic, I hope that this is your connection for more than just one conduit because this is a lot.
But getting the ball rolling and getting started is a great place and we would love to have updates on on what you've learned and and how you get there. Definitely.
