From Relay FM, you're listening to Condoid, the show where we condue our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Condoid, the show that helps you take ideas and execute them. This episode is brought to you by Micro.Blog.
I'm Kathy and with me today is the man who makes a pre-flight checklist but doesn't actually read it. Jay Miller. Hi Jay. Look and we're talking about executing our ideas. I like to use a guillotine. Wow. Wow, you went there. All right, so we're going to just ignore that and move right along.
And this week in the discord, there was an Apple event, which I don't know if you know, yeah. Yeah, iPads, the thinnest iPads ever, including the instruments that God has them up. Yeah, the unfortunate advertisement, which, you know, moving right along from that.
But our friends, Federico and Mike went to the London event and got to meet people that I think people know I don't know who they were, but they look excited to take photos.
So have we resigned the idea that we will ever be an Apple podcast that Apple people get excited about and we'll send us free things? Because if so, as an Apple shareholder, I just want to throw out there that like, it's all for the money and I don't really care.
Federico didn't even get a new iPad, a free iPad, or a review iPad. Yeah, so we have no, no, but that's okay. Because I don't, I'm not, I'm not the right market for that. I mean, I just, I know that we're, we're on a very Apple centric network, shout out to all of you.
Apple, you, you, Apple, you, Apple, you, Apple, you, Apple, you, Apple, you, Apple, you, you, Apple, all the Apple nerds out there. But like, I haven't really been interested since condo.
I think like for folks that don't know the last episode that I did of my old podcast was Kathy and I doing a WTC recap. And I think we were both just so bored and just so excited to do the thing that we were going to be doing, which became known as conduit. Yeah.
And like ever since in the last like three years or four years, how long have we been doing this now? Too long. Oh my gosh, way too long. It 75 episodes, 75 episodes. Man, we can get ARP now. Oh, technically you can get ARP at any age. They just, yeah.
My, my spouse can get ARP, which is why we get all of the advertisements because they're on Medicare. So no, I think you can, I think you can get ARP at any age. You just have to apply. Yeah. But there's certain things that you're not eligible for without disability or age.
That being just like most people that are on ARP, most people, not all people, most people. I think it's time to re retire this hype cycle that we have for, for these Apple events. I'm over it.
I mean, so first off, nobody cares what you're over because you don't like Bluey or Disney or anything fun. So we're good at just. That's not opinion J.A. It's Apple. Yeah. Wow. I'm shocked. Is there anything that you like? I don't know. Recieve. Other than me. You like me, right? And happy, yeah.
Okay. Okay.
 But I think, I think the hard thing is is because it's every year, there's almost like a hyperbolic excitement when it comes to events that it makes it difficult to for non-Apple journalists, which lots of our friends are lots of network, like lots of podcasts on the network are all hyped about it and they get excited about it because of these micro changes.
But when it comes to the quote unquote, normies or the people that are like, Oh, what's the new iPhone? Nope. It's not my time yet. Or the ones that will buy a new iPad in March because they don't care when the new ones come out.
It's hard to get excited about things unless there is a super exciting thing to get excited about. I genuinely think it's more along the marketing angle of just having worked at tech companies now for several years.
Like I've been on the other side of that where you have these individuals like they get up on stage, they're like, I'm so excited to announce blah, blah, blah.
And like meanwhile, you have who knows how many people behind the scenes that are like, you know, blah, blah, blah doesn't, doesn't really work the way that people think it does. Or oh, blah, blah, blah was like duct tape together and is very, very fragile.
Or blah, blah, blah is this thing that like a really awesome idea got canned for because someone really wanted to smash up a piano and put it into an iPad. And well, I mean, that's, that's an everything though.
And I don't think it's fair to use the judgmentalness of the people in the project or like the concerns that the people in the project have because that percentage of like the population is so small. I guess what I'm trying to say is I think there are a lot of great ideas.
And I think some of them aren't executed as well as we like to give big brands, big, big celebratory capitalism companies like the benefit of the doubt. And by all means, again, y'all keep being happy because I'm going to keep buying Apple stock. And that number is going to keep going up.
So like as for me, my excitement is I go and I look at my shares and how they're, how they're trending. But outside of that, it's like I'm going to buy the new phone when it comes out.
You didn't need to spend, you know, the hundreds of thousands of dollars that you did to make the commercial, bring all the people in and then do this big live streaming event that could have been an email. You could just send the email. You could just do the press release and call it a day.
And I'll be just as excited. I'll be more excited because that means you're spending less money. What do we do in our co-working? Oh, yeah. We eat our superconductor friends, complained. What else is new about airplane flights and visas and traveling internationally.
So we were also able to comfort calf the when she learned about the disappointing news of her data recovery woes. Yeah, I remember that now. That was sad times. Oh, my gosh. I almost cried on camera for those that don't know in the month of hell, aka March, slash April.
There was a two three week period where I had to replace my phone. I had to get my computer by camera to the doctor because I dropped it. By the way, I still don't have it back. It's still in surgery and a hard drive failed. And then I shipped it off because it was still under warranty.
It was a 14 terabyte drive and they sent me a two terabyte. And I had a two terabyte drive back with nothing. No, with only a couple of things from that drive all within the last six months.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, was it a full two terabyte drive or did they send you like a two terabyte drive and it had like a hundred meg on it? They sent a two terabyte drive that had about a terabyte on it. Okay. Okay.
So they were saying like to add insult to injury, it was like it wasn't even like a they didn't have a read like they could have give you like a 512 gig thumb drive. And no, but they might as well have because a lot of it, yeah, it just I still haven't heard back from them in the email, by the way.
 So I am going to send another closely worded one of like, hey, WTF, because every indicate that they said like there was no burbage in the count like in the communication that said, hey, you know, we were able to wreak, we were only able to recover some of the stuff or anything it said your recovery is successful.
And that's even worse. Yeah. So I'm not a math or but that's yeah, that 14 terabyte drive was pretty full. I would say maybe about 10 or 11 terabytes. And so I don't know what the percentage of even two terabytes is from 14 terabyte, but it's a math a math and there. One one seventh.
Yeah, thank you. A seventh of the amount of data is not in my mind a successful recovery. Like yes, there were some things that were like saved, but yeah.
So I now that I have gone through the morning period as well, I do have a drive with the older stuff in it that I can pull when I switch to that 14 terabyte.
So there is some of the like old old stuff that I could still grab from, but yeah, it just, it was emotional, but thankfully my superconductors with were with me to support me while I went off and cried a little bit. Oh, yeah.
But if you want to join us for our next core king session, which hopefully will be less dramatic and less sad in the off weeks with myself and Jay or listen live while we're recording in the discord, visit I am a superconductor dot com to become a member today.
That's letter I letter M letter A superconductor dot com. That means it's time for connection checks. That's that. Yeah, connection checks. This one, this one was stressful. Yeah.
Yeah, how do you do? So I did the thing and this one, this one was cheating because the thing was going to get done like here. No, no, it's not cheating. It's not cheating to choose a connection check. That's easy. Well, it wasn't even like a connection check that was easy.
It was like a, I guess it was a declaration of there is a nothing else that in my mind at the moment in involving like the execution of things that are slightly hard that is more important than this. And it was like, this is going to get done because I'm going to give this workshop regardless.
Now, the workshop can be a horrible workshop or it can be a like mostly good workshop. And when it turned out to be was a mostly good workshop. And again, it was, it was one of these things were like the first time we ever do one of these, you know, one of these workshops.
It's always a little bumpy because things pop up and you don't know what's going to pop up until it does. But there are so many things that you can account for that we needed to just get through. And we, it seems like we were able to do that well enough.
So like I'm, I mean, I'm, I'm taking the credit for it. I'm taking the success. But I think that there is, there is a trick to this where it's like there was a zero percent chance that I wasn't going to give the workshop.
So the workshop was finished purely because the workshop had to be finished in order to give it. And even if I did it to like a subpar amount, it would have still been finished. Yeah. But so, okay, that makes me wonder.
Um, why, why did you choose it to be your connection? Because there was a level of like dedication that I wanted to commit to it. Because I mean, like a perfect example of this is I have, I'm giving what I will consider probably the biggest talk of my career to date on Thursday.
I have another talk exactly one month from yesterday that I have to give that I'm hoping no one that is on the decision committee for this talk. I'm sorry. I do not care about that talk.
So like the amount of effort that is going into that talk versus the amount of effort that went into this talk will be considerably different.
The reason I chose this as a topic was purely in that I needed this to be important because this was this was the second version of this style of workshop that we've given. And I brought this style to the company. So it was we had this workshop that already existed.
I said, I think we can make it better if we adopt this style. And this will also be the template for what we should do in the future. And they said, let's give it a shot. So the first workshop went really, really well. That being said, the workshop already existed.
So it was more of like, how do I take this existing thing and conform it to fit this new mold that we're bringing in this workshop that I just gave I had to create it from scratch. And specifically, I was the one that was creating it.
So it was like, Hey, this is the first piece of work that I'm doing for this company.
It's also testing to see, can we develop in this style from zero and get there? Or do we need to like build something and then try to mold it to fit that shape?
And so for me, it was a lot of like, Jay, we put a lot of faith in you that you're going to do this thing because you believe that it's going to help.
Good luck with that. And like I said, everything turned out great. There were definitely a lot of moments where I really started to question whether or not it would be doable. But yeah, it wasn't it turned out good. And I'm excited about that. And I'm happy about that.
I just again, I want to, I want to be transparent and saying that not, not every connection has to be a winner lose situation. Sometimes you need the win.
And sometimes the win is so important that just setting it up of like, Hey, even if it's a terrible, terrible like job of this, even if I did the worst possible version of this workshop, I can come to conduit, say that I did the thing and now it's over. And I don't have to think about it anymore.
And there's just something so relieving about that that to me made it worth it. I get it. That works. So my connection was to take some risky naps and that naps on the side of a building. Yeah. Naps standing up.
No, that meant basically many naps at times like in between meetings or like times that maybe I shouldn't go nap, but I went and I would lay down for like 15 or 20 minutes. Let me tell you that was perfect. The last two weeks have been, I haven't been sleeping super well.
And so I've needed the naps and it's been absolutely fantastic. I highly recommend adding risky naps to your own schedule as need be. How about our conductors? Oh, we're soprano, the show. Devos says green heart. I wrote up a memory of one of my college roommates who died recently of cancer.
If you wanted to collect memories to give to her kids that showed her as a real person, I think that's absolutely lovely. Sorry for your loss, but good job on doing an emotionally hard. Yeah. Yeah.
Our robotics engineer of the show, Aiden says connection check and green heart job applications continue to be sent out and I even had an in person interview last week. Good luck. Oh, interviews.
Our identical twin of the show, Aaron said the 10 K on Sunday went well, I had fun and was pleased with my time. Good job. You fast way faster than I could do our mountain dweller of the show. Low guy. Low guy.
Connection check, green check mark website made plan in place to go part time at the day job and the owner of the gym. I was hoping for offer to let me shadow other trainers and start sending me clients as soon as I get the cert finished heck to the yeah. That's so exciting.
I feel I feel that low gang is is crushing it, you know, and in all the things. This is amazing. This is amazing news. I'm excited for you. So excited. The Canadian trivia card enthusiasts of the show, Erica said green heart. I treated myself gently for a couple of weeks.
I should do this more often. That's what I'm saying. Yes. Yes, be nice to my friend, please. Our pathologist of the show, Laura says green heart. My connection was to reinvigorate my regular reviews, which I did.
I've done both weekly reviews, a monthly review and a many daily review reflection about half the time. That is impressive. Well flipping done. Laura, so proud of you. You done flipped it. Our fish bear, the show, Fishekai says yellow circle.
I did better with my sleep schedule, but every moment, even those reserved for sleep, can easily be filled with things to do if I'm not careful. Yeah, I think that we've, again, we've talked about, see our pre-show where we talked about the millennials that we both are.
I think that we have lost a lot of value in just sleeping and being bored and a lot of those things. I hope we bring those things back. Also, I just realized that I'm doing something that I think is hilarious that I want to talk about in the post show before we do our post show thing. Okay.
Our oracle of the show says green heart. My goal is to get some rest. I took a weekend off, then went on vacation and then caught COVID again. But I've definitely been resting. Listen, sometimes the universe just says, hey, I need to slap you over the head with something in order to rest.
So that's like a very dangerous slapper, like just walking around slapping people with COVID. You're actually the second person that I've heard has COVID now, which is making me worry because they were also at an event. And hey, I'm going to an event followed by going to another event.
Oh no, not again, not again. Rat row. Our nameless of the show nameless says green circle. I completed the assignments with minimal procrastination. Good job. Good job. Done. Our tech podcast listener of the show, Pillix says yellow square. I haven't worked on my granddad project.
My work schedule has changed and it's harder for me to take personal time. I have applied for jobs and survived. I have kept learning SwiftUI and sadly the job I had an interview with didn't take me. It's okay. It wasn't a job I was looking forward to. Yes. Yes. Well done.
They're missing out anyway. Yeah. Also, that gives you more time to work on my projects. The checklist enthusiasts of the show, Mike says green check mark, finish preparations for by daughters, fourth birthday party. The party went well. Oh, that's what the plans were.
The party went well despite the rain, but we had fun indoors. Hey, I like it. I like it. When life gives you lemons, start asking life, why are you just issuing lemons to people? That's kind of weird. Oh, this episode of Condo is brought to you by micro.blog.

blog for the support of the show and all of relay FM. I seriously thought that there was going to be a point in there where you were going to ask about using micro.blog in some way, shape or form. So I literally opened up drafts and wrote a micro.
blog post about a new game that I've been playing called Rusty's Retirement, which is an amazing little game where you just just plant the, just plant the things. But it's that simple because all I did was send it and then now that I sent it, I will upload it to GitHub and micro.
blog does all the rest because it reads my RSS feed and it'll say new post alert and then it will post it for me to micro.blog. Amazing. I love how easy that is. Yeah, there's the fact that I could like update my micro.blog and my blog and my mass it on and LinkedIn, maybe LinkedIn, I don't know.
Twitter, maybe depending on how they feel, all while you're reading an ad about it, yeah, that sounds pretty great. Pretty great. The topic for today is talking about if you're an idea person or an executor person executioner, no, don't like any of those. I could never. I could never.
But it's funny because I had a conversation with a potential client last weeks ago. I don't know. It's some point in the past. They desperately need somebody that is able to make things happen. I am not an idea person. If you give me piece of blank paper and say, right ideas, my brain shuts down.
This is why I participate in things like the game shows on the incomparable. The only game show I host is once a year at Christmas time when I just read the silly Christmas trivia cards because I'm not very good at coming up with the actual ideas.
But if somebody has an idea and they say it out loud and I come around and I'm like, oh, well, we could do this, this and this and just get it done. Great. Perfect. Awesome. Figure it out. And so, Jay, I want to know what, which type of person are you? I am. At least I believe that I am.
And all like I am the opposite. I'm also I'm an ideas person. I feel like if we looked at the balance of Jay bringing things into the ether, I'm like, oh, we could do this. Like we could make a candle that has one smell on one side of one smell on the other.
We'll call it the burnout candle and you don't want to burn them at the same time because it'll smell bad. Like there's there's this weird like space that I live in that's I feel like in part, Peewee's playhouse in part like gumbees, whatever you call where gumbe lives.
And then the third one is like that evil villains layer in spy kids. Oh, yeah. And this is just my brain. It is. It is a constant like world of pure imagination, I guess. And in that I am. I'm really bad. At the like understanding the scope. About what it really takes.
And I think sometimes this is good because I think that some people over not over complicate. But I think some people make things harder than they actually need to be. Which is so hilarious at times.
See the world that I live in where I am actively helping, you know, bring diversity to a developer community in mass. And people are like, it's hard. And I'm like, it's kind of not though. Like you're right. It is it is hard to do it perfectly.
But no one's asking to do things perfectly all the time. We just we kind of put that expectation on ourselves. So like if I'm able to just jump in and say, hey, all I had to do was start doing things. That's going to be better than doing nothing.
The challenge with that is often I will just be doing things to do them. And I feel like that's like spinning your tires and doing donuts and someone's like, hey, where are you going? And I'm like, I don't know. But these donuts. Donuts. Yeah.
So yeah, like I feel like it's good to be able to jump from that idea phase to that. Like I'm going to do phase. But I think that there is something powerful about being like just knowing where you are in that space of like.
If you're not a good ideas person, get around a bunch of ideas people and then help them execute on their ideas. That sounds fantastic. I would love at least seven more cathes to help me with all the wild ideas that I have.
But I also think that there's something to say about people who are like, I'm an idealist person. I'm not an ex, I'm not a person who can execute on things. No, that's not fair. Like don't, I understand using your brain is hard. But don't, don't be that person just because doing things is hard.
And I think that's, that's the big challenge that I always try to bump against. Well, I think, I think though too. It's okay to be just, quote, unquote, just the ideas person. If you are in a world where you are able to financially support people that will execute them.
If all you want to do is sit and be able to like. Flip out ideas and other people can take care of it. Great. If that means that you are able to. Hand over those ideas to people that you trust and that you can pay a living wage to.
Um, the difficulty comes into it when you are either a solo pranour or a partnership. And you expect everything to be done. Even if you are not like in a position to actually give back some sort of benefit to those people that are executing your ideas. That's where it can be dangerous.
But otherwise, if you are in a world where, you know, I'm thinking of so many, you know, CEOs that come and they're like. You know, Johnny I, for example, will be like, let's make it all white. And smooth, no buttons. And then Apple comes around and is like, okay, here we go. Let's, let's do this.
And it kind of works. But he got into a position with those ideas in a way that allowed him to have. For the most part, the company, you know, get things done the way it needed to get done. If that makes sense. It makes sense. The thing that scares me with that though is.
See long diatribe about all the stuff that we've dealt with with people who are like, you know, who are fawning over this. This ancient memory of what Apple events used to be when they were literally doing the thing that no one except for Android had done before. Like now it feels weird.
Now it's like, if everybody is being Johnny I than nobody is Johnny I. And it's like a warhol. And there's only I haven't seen anybody try to recreate warhol. I haven't seen anybody find success in painting their version of a warhol.
No one's ever been like, I'm going to paint that Campbell soup can and be like, wow, wow, not not since not since warhol. Have we seen a can so can't believe like it's it's amazing.
Like that's the mentality that we give a lot of these people who who are just ideas people and there's again chase chase really fired up an angry right now. Yeah, I don't know why.
But there's like this this weird mentality that we give to people who are not coming up with new ideas who are not coming up with inventive things. And I think that's the thing that makes me so frustrated is that I do think that you could say Johnny I was an artist in the way that he did things.
And like the whole like. Johnny I've had people to do stuff. Yes. So did most modern or most contemporary artists like. Lee and Ardo Da Vinci and all of them they had studios that painted the Sistine Chapel he was not up there by himself. No, actually, Michael Angelo did do it.
He did it all by himself. Yeah. He like climbed a rope and was like hold on, I got this. Yeah, he was on his back in the in the thing for weeks and weeks and weeks, but he did he did have a studio that other things were done that he would have apprentices and whatnot help and yeah.
But like even in those moments there's so many things like that where yes, you can be an influential idea person. But I spend so much time around people that are just like do the thing do the do the thing that the other people did I'm so smart I have great ideas.
And it's like you didn't that that wasn't an idea that was assignment says like my my daughter can say do the thing that that person did over there and she's five.
In fact, that's kind of what she only does is she mimics and that's a thing that I feel like I am personally on a crusade to weed out because I love you know, hey, find your thing.
Find the thing that you like doing that brings you inspiration that gives you that proud moment those goose bumpy feelings and and start building those things and it can be inspired by other things.
But I feel like we've we've for the idea people I feel like we are becoming less and less inspired and more and more copy cats. And that whole still like artist thing is annoying and I don't want to talk about it right now. What you don't like something. I'm shocked. No, it's not that. No, tapping.
Oh, don't don't poke. I think, okay, I think it's important to have a mixture of both. And I think it's important to be able to recognize who you are.
And what your strengths are and be able to push yourself to be in a relationship where it's like if you're in a partnership or something with someone else that is the other type of person. Um, be able to support them in that. So even though I'm not an ideas person. I do try to put ideas out there.
They're not great. And they need to be I iterated on. I'm not a person. I'm not a person. I'm not a person. But I am doing my best. We'll say it that way. And so I'm I embrace the fact that I am a executioner type person.
And so I don't have any necessarily negative effects towards the people that are ideas only people. Um, because I can also tell them, hey, will you do x, y, and z part of this to support it? Even my clients that I do work with and I am responsible for executing a lot of the stuff for them.
I know that they are the idea person and they are the ones that will come in and be like, hi. Uh, let's do this. And I'll be like, okay, we can or what if we do this instead? And then they're like, yeah, sure. And we make those changes. I complained enough.
So I want you to complain, um, about the, or at least provide insight. Maybe you don't have to complain. But I want you to expound on the idea of being a serial doer and the experience that you get, um, that is able to not just, you know, tell the, the idea person that their idea is dumb.
But to trick them into thinking that your execution, you're very, very smart. Like if I did it exactly how you wanted, it would never work. So I'm going to do it and do it in the best execution or way possible in which also we need I'm an executioner t-shirt. Uh-huh. That has to happen.
Um, what would the alternative be? What would be the idea person? I'm not going to do it. But it's an ID, a T, I'm an idiot. I'm an ID. I'm an ideator. No, just an ID. Okay. Cause it'll look like I'm an idiot.
But you're implying that if they're not an executor, an executor, an ID, an ID, though, I am a person that has way more ideas than the actual execution on them.
And that's why I value the executioner because I know that if, if it's, if I'm left to my own design, again, I'm just doing donuts, I'm like doing things not really knowing the, the like appropriate or correct way to execute on that thing. And like I'm, I like how Laura put it.
I'm great at, I'm great at editing textbook terrible at writing a first draft. See, I'm great at writing a terrible first draft. So like, I work with the person who's good at editing a terrible first draft and making it sound really good.
But the like, the challenge that comes with that is there are people who equate one or the other to being the whole thing. Yes, or the one that this is a better person, like the person, just like Erica said, like the, the fact that society thinks that ideas are better.
Or like ideas, people are more valued. Also, my computer just froze. So I don't know if you can still hear me or if I'm so recording. Okay, that's good. I'm, but it's very weird. I can't do anything. So this may or may not, I have a backup recording. Good.
Because who knows what's happening right now. It's very strange. Like I can't, I can't click anything. But yes, no, please, please while you're waiting for your computer to come back to awakeness.
Please, please talk about some of your strategies for tricking the, the ideates to believing that they are executing on your thing as you expect. Up, I think I lost you. Well, while we wait for Kathy, wait, can the chat still hear me? See you, Kathy. Yeah, Kathy's computer is not a tour.
Kathy's Kathy executed the computer. While we're waiting for Kathy to get back and I'm guessing join the Zoom call again, I will, yet, Kathy's not the Zoom call.
I will just say, I think that the best, the best thing that both, that, ideators, ideates, whatever we call them, and executioners, which I really just love that we're calling them executioners now, is awareness.
Is that awareness that without no, not imagineers, how, without the ability to have the self awareness to know your strengths and know your weaknesses.
You are, you're going to be capable of doing things like that's like I'm never worried that I'm not able to kind of like what I talked about with my connection. I had full confidence that I would be able to do the thing.
The challenge was because I am someone who is an ideas person more than I am a person who can execute on those ideas. I had to have a system that almost made it the cookie cutter version of executing on this idea. Like it was executing executing executing by numbers.
And this is where you know those books like the checklist manifesto and things like that are really, really cool. Like when I pack to go to an event, like I will have all the ideas in the world about what I want to pack.
But then I have the reality of like, okay, the last time I did this, I needed this, this, this, and this, also this, and the trick is I just keep all that stuff in a bag. I do it, I do it. I'm not Kathy Kathy who just joined us again. Hi.
Hi, can people hear Kathy? We're talking about how we cheat, how we trick ourselves if we're planters, imaginers, idiots, ideates, whatever. How we, how we can trick ourselves into being a more of an executioner when we need to.
And for me, like I said, that's when I'm packing things, like when I'm going to an event, I know what I need for my event. But I also know that everything is already in a bag ready to go. And it never leaves that bag.
And the only time it leaves that bag is if I like need to charge something and then it immediately goes back in the bag. Because if it doesn't go back in the bag, I'm going to forget it. Just like how I went to Spain.
And then while I was in the airport, I had to buy a power converter because hadn't been to Europe in a minute. By a minute, I mean like 15 years. So absolutely forgot that like, oh yeah, their plugs are shaped funny.
And like, I got it, which funny, funnily enough, I learned that Taiwan actually has the same stuff that America has. I don't need to take my converter or plug adapter thingy. Oh, that's awesome. See? Yeah. The rest of the world knows America's number one.
I mean, rest of the world is like a pretty sure Taiwan's the only one like that. But I don't know. Put us in the top four, maybe.
But like, if you are, I've kind of talked about me being that the person who thinks more better than does, unless we're talking about words and then I don't do either any of that good. Kathy, as someone who does better than thinks, which I think is probably not the nicest way of saying that.
I mean, it's not wrong though. How do you, how do you put yourself into the put on my thinking cap doing some thinking, got an idea and it might not be horrible.
How do you, how do you get yourself into that space? How do you make yourself a temporary thinker for a moment? That's so hard because I don't, I don't do it very well. I will tend to. So you know that whole statement that you made, steel like an artist earlier. Yeah, that's me. Basically, I will.
Yeah, no, the book, wait, you read it. You actually read a book. I read the cliff notes. Oh, okay, okay, cool. I, yeah, I, I, I will see what other people's ideas have come out. Like, I will see so all either Google or I'll put it on Pinterest or like something to try and get an idea.
Um, to, to formulate something, um, maybe I'll start using like chat GPT to just go, and just like stick stuff out and see if it can come out better.
But when it comes down to it for the most part, it's because I have to be a, an idea person or something will influence, like be pushed out that says, I need you to do this.
So like, for example, I'm trying to get ideas on how to like what to do for this trip to Taiwan, um, in a content creator aspect. Um, to add value to the ad read and whatnot. And, and part of that is going on TikTok and seeing what have other people done going on Instagram. That sort of thing.
So still, I am a big proponent of stealing like an artist. And then making it my own because that is easier for me than being an ideator with a blank page. If that makes sense. I like the idea of inspiration. And I think this is, this is that myth.
Um, like apparently did you know that there are more men that use Pinterest than women, even though it is often categorized as a tool that women use and women only because we have to assign genders to things. Right. And then, like, I think that is our world is dumb.
Um, but no, there, there is this like, I love getting ideas for things, but the idea is just that it's an idea. It's never, like I never want it to be, I can do that too. And this is why I'm not famous.
This is why I'm not like the people who are amazing, the companies who are amazing, um, the apples of the world, they wait for people to get to do the thing. They let it get done. And then once it's done, they go, now I'm going to do it.
And I'm going to do it better than that person did it because they fleshed out all the bad stuff. They, they showed us how not to do it and how we should do it instead. And now I'm going to only do that.
And to me, I'm the person that's like, I want to do it the bad way because doing it the bad way is fun. It's not about the and profit. It's about the, I did a thing.
And I think that that's, that's like the mentality that I don't know that's the mentality that I wish was more prominent in this world.
And that that's why I don't like this, still like an artist, still like an artist is like, yes, but for that money, though, like do it your own way for that money, though. And I'm like, no, just do it your own way because that should be fun. We're not getting into this.
Maybe this will be the next episode because I, I think it's important to I, I'm, J's talking out of his butt. If you don't like what J has to say, then you should go to feedback, fill in the feedback in the show notes. Relay dot com slash condo at slash feedback. Yeah, until J why he's wrong.
You give us your foot in feedback. That is not a URL. Oh, is it going to have to be? No, it's going to. No, I don't want to listen. My September, your URL payment is already large. That's what she said.
All of this to say, I think Kathy and I work well together because you have an idiot and an executioner together. Doing, doing fun things and having fun in the process. I do believe that we did an episode that was like the, the journey is the destination.
And, you know, Or is it the destination is the journey? I don't know. I don't know. I love and all that. Do, do all the things that spark joy and manifest positivity in your life or whatever. Oh gosh. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, so, so J.
What is your next, for the next fortnight? I'm going to execute on some things. Nice. I'm trying to think now because I've got a lot of things happening. Some of them is a lot going on right now. There's a lot going on right now. I, I need to ask for help. I need to figure out how to ask for help.
I have people that want to help. I need to hear here's where I'm going to need your help on this. I am afraid that I don't have enough information to ask for help. And what that winds up turning into is while I'm trying to get enough information to ask for help, I just wind up doing the thing.
And again, this is where like, as an ideas person, I often don't know enough about the execution layer of it. To be able to effectively give people enough guidance that they can do the work on their own. Okay. Here is my question for you.
Do you have to give that guidance? Is this type of a thing, something that you are required to give the guidance? Or is it something that an executor could come in and like push past that? Uh, obviously it's not going to be done the same way that you would do it.
But would it be good enough? I, the thing that worries me is I think that they're going to look to me to give them guidance. And okay, okay, okay. I'm going to, I'm going to push back on that.
Is there a problem with that where they will ask a question? Do you have to sit and block out or map out all of the steps? Or can you say, Hey, do this. Let me know if you have any questions. And then they'll come back with like one or two questions that you can give assistance on.
But then turn around and be like, they can do a lot of it. I don't know. Okay. How about this? Try it. Okay. I will, that will be my connection is to try to give people the ability to execute on my idea.
Uh, Laura, this is the challenge of like if I give them the goal, the basic guidelines and the limits, I feel like in the end, it's going to be like, do this in this way, like this.
And then they're like, can I just copy and paste what you just did? But you're not like, okay, you need it, you need to walk that back. And I want you to not imagine what you would do it if it was your project. And yes, not the steps, but the actual here is what needs to happen. Here's my idea.
And here is like when I'd like it done, or like the basic limits, it's also difficult without this, this like project. Yes, look at Pilux. See, Pilux, he is going to be able to help you with this, but doesn't need you to give him the exact steps. Yeah.
So something, something similar to that, but something that is way less, it's way, it's fuzzier. Okay. And that's fine. That's fine. It can be fuzzier. Let the person that is helping you ask the questions.
You don't need to pre-answer questions that you, like you don't need to go in and, and, and suppose it for them. Wait for them to ask the questions. Here's what I can do. Okay. Here's my official connection.
While we are still on this, this episode, I am going to draft the message that I will send at the end of this episode to the people that I want help from. And I will tell them that I don't have guidance for them that I want them to think about it, come up with ideas and put them in.
No idea is bad, but they need to be willing to outline the steps on executing on those ideas, because that's going to be the part that I need help with figuring out the, like, why isn't this going to work?
And that's, that's like the headache is that I'm trying to come up with the ideas, but also trying to, like, come up with why the ideas aren't going to work.
Whereas what I think that I've done is I've fostered this mentality that people don't want to come up with ideas anymore, because my role has been to shoot them down so often. And it's not because I want to shoot them down.
It's just because at one point every, every idea they had cost me money, not, right. Well, and other people money. I will, I will say this to like that is normal. I do this a lot in my drag amount stuff is I shoot down ideas that people have a lot.
 But I always make sure to reaffirm them that hey, I will, like, this is, it's important to make sure that you're fostering the idea that yes, your ideas are valid and like appreciated and that sort of thing while still still giving the structure that's needed for whatever project you're working on.
And if they have a problem with your, you're in charge of this. So you're the one that's going to say if something's not necessarily a good or bad idea, but if something is possible or not.
And I think it's important to make sure that they know that, hey, yes, this might not be the best idea, but I want you to still continue to come up with ideas. So make sure they're feeling supported and that even if this idea is bad or like not. But it's still doable at this point.
It's still appreciated. Yeah, I like it.
What about you, Kathy? Yeah, my, I have a project, I have to finish writing, like updating a client's like the document that you have with like, here's how you do stuff things so that we can transition over a huge chunk of projects to someone else in the team.
I don't want to do it because it's, it's something that I've been doing for years and years and years and pulling it out of my head onto paper is really awful. I'm going to do a boring and yet it needs to happen and it needs to happen sooner rather than later.
 But what I'm going to do is in this next fortnight, I am going to facilitate a cozy place to do this work that needs to happen, whether it's going to a Starbucks or going to the co-breaking space, I'm going to do something to make this awful boring terrible but work a little bit special, a little bit more bowl.
Making a cozy place sounds so nice. Yeah, sounds so much fun. What about our conductors? They're not doing anything. They decided to get together. They were like, no, we're done. Our sub-ranner of the show Devos says, plant out the pattern and fabrics for a baby quilt for some friends.
