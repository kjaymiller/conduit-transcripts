 From RelayFo, you're listening to Conduot. The show we Condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduot. The show that you only know about because we tell you about it. This episode is brought to you by our lovely superconductors. I am Jay. I'm a staff product advocate for Ivan and the founder of Black Python Devs. And with me is the internet's busyness unicorn. Kathy Campbell. Hey Kathy. Hey, I'm here. I'm busy. Let's go. Let's go. Folks, my voice might sound different because it's winter time. And every winter I lose my voice. And just like clockwork, you heard sleigh bells. That wasn't Santa Claus on your rooftop. That was the flu season. Getting ready to mess my life up. And then maybe Santa Claus if you believe. So last we got a hurry on this. Last week in the co-working, something amazing happened. We learned that I'm not a graphic designer. Even though Kathy has made me edit photos before in the past. And has tried to teach me a thing or two. Yeah, myself, my visual eye is, well, it isn't. So I noticed that the nonprofit that I run Black Python Devs was about $200 away from hitting kind of a good milestone for us for the year. And I wanted to make a quick post about it. And I will save the results of that for the one good thing. But I tried to show it to Kathy to which everyone was like, it's so ugly. Yeah. And then they proceeded to walk me through making it look better. And yeah, like I said, we'll talk about the results of that in just a second. But yeah, that all happened in the co-working. And if you wanted to be a part of the, let's pick on Jay for an hour session. That's in to happen. You can go to I'm a superconductor.com and become a member today. That's letter I letter M letter A superconductor.com. Kathy, what was your one good thing? Yeah. So the past two weeks have been really busy, of course, because it is the holiday season. But one good thing has been really sitting, like spending some quality time with family and friends. I know that it's, you know, it's cliche because it's the holiday season. That's what you should do. But I have tried to be more intentional with it as I wrap up the year of connection. And I really like what happened. But, you know, I like these people in my life. And I'm really lucky to have them and getting to tell them how much I love them is also really great. So yay, friends and family. Two thumbs up. Hooray, friends and family. Yeah, so I published the banner that came out. And would you believe it? We didn't only raise the $200. We raised $900, which means that we're almost in the exact same spot for the next milestone in fundraising. That said, there's only two days left in the year. I am, like, I am very content this year. We raised $15,000 to do. That's incredible. Yeah, to help, you know, just help create. I don't know the words for it. To create opportunities for equity and equality amongst developers in black spaces. It has been like fantastic. And it wraps up my third year doing this. And my second year doing this as a nonprofit. I can't even begin to think about like how far it's gone. And like how much further it needs to go today to be something that is truly sustainable. But yeah, if you buy any chance, want to be the people who can like ring in, because this will come out in 2026. If you want to be the people to help get 2026 off to a good start, go to blackpithondevs.com and donate. 75% of the proceeds go straight back into the community helping put on events and places and making sure that it is accessible to black people around the world. Even those that don't necessarily identify as black. So all of those fun things go be supportive of that. But now it's time for the connection check. Kathy, how did you do? Yeah, so my connection was very simple. It was to get a dimming light so that I have light next to my bed so that I can start doing my journaling at night. Not only do I get a green checkmark, but most of the past two weeks I have actually done my journaling at night. I need to, so I got a notebook. Don't really love the paper on it, which makes it really hard to write. So I need to get something else for that. Oh no, I have to get a new notebook. I'm so sad. It's so hard. But it's been really helpful to kind of write things down. Let myself conscious, sit with it, and just kind of. I learned that I am very much a night pages instead of morning pages because it lets me just get it all out of the leg. And then I can fall asleep as opposed to trying to get everything out and then work through those things. So two thumbs up for night pages. What about you, Jay? How did you do in the past four days? So my connection check was to prep for the end of the year episode. And actually the beginning of our coworking session, I was able to get that done. I'm also in the process of figuring out a better approach for the conduit transcriptions and search thing for reasons. I'll be back with you guys next year. We've got a special present for hopefully if I can do my thing that will be super cool. So yeah, there's a lot going on there. But ultimately I had to think about this episode. And we did a lot this year, but we also didn't do as much as we thought we did. What about our conductors? Yeah, our carl of all trades at the show Carl says connection check, green apple and the yellow circle. I was able to answer some urgent and important emails at work before the holiday break, but totally ignored other urgent and important emails. Grades and finals were done with and entered in on time. But a network outage means I will still need to check for errors and finals when I get back from break. My daughter's mental health is stable, but still can be touching go. So a very yellow green of a fortnight plus that is a whole heck of a lot. So proud of you though for going through it. You can do it. Hold on one second. I'm people in the chat are chatting. So I'm chatting with the chat people chatting. Our checklist. Our checklist enthusiasts of the show Mike says checkmark clear the decks so I can spend the holidays with family and not worry. I mostly clear the decks on my task list and had a great holiday with my family. I'm so glad to hear that. Amazing. All right. Our doll of the show. Who death mall. Death mall. That's all. Death mall. Molly. Molly says previous connection. Who knows LOL. Love it. That is something that I really enjoy is that hey, if you forget that's okay. There's nothing wrong. And we'll work through and figure it out. You can jump in anywhere anytime. And we'll help take care of you. Our death mall is my favorite like Star Wars techno group. It's like death punk. Oh, wow. It's dark house. It's dark side house. There we go. The awe of the show. Oh, no, it's the end of the year. Oh, that's my voice literally quit. It was like, nope. Green tree. I took it easy over the last couple of weeks with the exception of two or three busier days. I almost, I'm almost feeling all the way back to normal. That's good. That's good to hear. Yay. All right. Our soprano of the show. Debo says connection check. Green heart made lots of bows to decorate the church for Christmas. representation of his favorite show. This will be more yourself a non virtual beauty again. I- I think the setup goes well with the most. You post it back to the movies when we yawned So many people squared you know that the album was such a cute couple. Like I said that's not that fast as well. We've had quite a lot of fun together, but I don't記得 where it's supposed to be. talking kind of about like some of the different social media that are out there. And Kathy made this very, very like wonderful thought of like, hey, if I don't, I like social media isn't like necessarily my thing or writing is not my thing, then like, I'm not going to do it. And what I've kind of figured out is that like following social media is just not my thing, but a thing that is absolutely wonderful is the discord, the relay discord. There's so much. I saw new pens. I saw people sharing gifts. I saw people showing decorations. All of these amazing things like it's like the most positive community that you can be a part of that ever existed on a discord. Like for real, if you have a little grinchiness when it comes to the social media landscape right now and you just want a place where you can be around amazing thoughtful people and just share kind of the amazingness that is life right now. The relay discord is that place. And you can become a member at I'm a superconductor.com. And I think you'll enjoy it. Great. Yeah. Okay. Sorry. Where were we? We were at the, uh, Profane Sleeper of the show. Yes. Mike. Connection check was crying. Everything was fine, but the wife was admitted to the hospital on Christmas Day for sepsis in pneumonia. Oh my goodness. Um, please, please. Yeah. Be better. Mostly stay at the hospital since then. Please take care of yourself. Be better. Yeah. Yeah. It's so important when you're caregiving to take care of yourself as well. So I hope you are getting some sleep, even if it's not good sleep. Uh, our shark of the show, Chris says my last connection was to finalize what my theme for next year will be green checkmark. I have determined that my theme for this coming year will be the year of the wingman. There's a realization that as much as I don't like asking for help, I do need help at times. And part of that is to determine who I can trust to get help from and the humility to ask for help when I need it. Wow. This hits this hits. Uh, yeah. Yeah. That's something I have been working with my therapist on is to ask for help in ways that feel good to me. Um, so I wish you the best of luck. Oh, man. Our mound roller of the show, a logang, um, says checkmark, emo sent fingers crossed. Hopefully a job comes from it. Yes. Our chief swifty of the show Andrew, who by the way, I hope, uh, you watched and enjoyed the documentary on Taylor Swift on, uh, Apple TV plus because I definitely got emotional for it. It was great. But Andrew says connection check green heart. I have been able to enjoy the holidays so far with family. We're still in the season of medical needs for our elders, but we are enjoying each other as we can. And that is all you can do. But that's wonderful. Thank you. I thought you were asking me, did I watch it? And I was like, uh, uh, I know you didn't. And our chief swifty of the show dead. Our nameless of the show nameless says tree got everything done in time for Christmas. Enjoyed the holidays with family. I got home office organized and feeling comfortable to be in again, but got distracted me from the actual tasks that be done here, but still needed a test that got done in that room. Okay. I like it. I like it. Got the, my office needs to very much be cleaned. Um, Kathy, I don't know if you saw this. Um, one of the amazing gifts that I did get from my family. Uh, I'll turn on my camera. I don't know if you can, you can't see it because of the, the glowing get hub logo, but you see the glowing J. Yeah. And then I got an Atlanta Braves light as well. That's just not on. Nice. But it's an A and then Brittany got me a white. With the white. So it says J behind you. That's really cute. I was like, that's, that's kind of awesome. That's great. I love it. I love it. Uh, robotics engineer of the show Aiden says connection check green tree. I was so focused on holidays. I didn't even realize it was connection time. That's okay. You're here and we appreciate you. And our tech podcast listener of the show, Pelix, um, who has some bubbly letters in the discord. It says green heart. The redacted project thing during the conduit. I did the messaging of the people to take the next step. Hey, that I love that because that that kind of does like two things. Um, I am really bad about like, Hey, I did a thing and then now it's in someone else's hands and like, I'm still holding on to that as like a me problem. And like, I'm not here to be like, how dare those people not be done with the thing? Already, I don't know if they are not. But what I would I will say is it's nice to be like at this point, I have done the things that I was supposed to do. And I have handed it over. And I've handed over the responsibility by notifying the people of the next step and being like, okay, this is now done. And again, I don't, I don't think that's necessarily like a shame on the, the people doing the other thing. But I, I do think that that is a thing that I have personally tried to be better at. And when I see other people doing it, it just makes me really excited. I love that. Love that. So Kathy, this is the last episode. Technically, it's the first episode of 2026. It's the last first, yeah. Yeah. So happy new year to everyone listening to this when it comes out. Um, actually, it'll be probably one of the only things in your podcast feed. So make sure you listen to it. So with that being said, last year we did this thing where we looked at all of the previous systems checks. And then we kind of talked about how that would wrap up, you know, like let's talk about how things have changed over the year. Yeah. And I wanted to bring that back, but I wanted to do something slightly different and make it the last episode of the year, which means it's technically the first episode of 2026. Next year, maybe we'll be better about it. I don't know. But it's our end of the year systems check. So Kathy, what is a systems check? Systems check is something that we do. We try to do quarterly. So we try to have for a year. But that doesn't always happen. And guess what? That is OK. That's how life happens. You know, we're doing the best we can. And that's what matters. And what the importance of the system check is that most of our episodes, we are system agnostic. So we're very aware and try to assist in the fact that everyone works differently. Everyone uses different tools, different things work for different people. And it's important to acknowledge and recognize that and that as long as you're getting stuff done and stuff is not getting missed, you are successful. Right? You can be seen as getting your things done. Our work for you is important. It's also important to look at the fact that stuff changes. As you grow or change or get bored with your system too, things adjust. And that is also OK. One of the things we have talked about a lot over the last four and a half years is that these productivity, gurus, and books come out to say that this is the one and only way things work. This is how it should be done. And the truth of the matter is, is that isn't real. There is no reality in that. Most people will never be in a situation where they will continuously do things the exact same way for their entire whatever life they live as a business person. Yeah. And that's really important to be aware of, I think. One of the things with that is that as times change, your system does need to change. But at the same time, you just can't spend all day changing systems. You can't just be like, I'm going to change the system. I'm going to change it again. And then I'm going to change it again. That's another side of the chaos. And the productivity gurus would love for you to do that because that means you'll try their system and it means you'll pay for it. And then when they tell you how their systems have changed and they write the second book, then they expect you to pay for that one too. So if you're constantly changing, then you're constantly feeding the idea of becoming productive, but not actually being productive. Yes. There's also the idea of spending so much time working towards the foundation of being productive that you forget to do the actual work. I don't know what you're talking about. Yeah. Yeah. You know, this idea that a new notebook will fix this problem or if I use this pen, it will do it. Let me buy this book and then I can be productive. And the truth of the matter is, is that doesn't, that's not real. That's unfortunately, if it was that easy, man, I wish it could be. I wish that if you bought this course, it would magically make everything work and the truth is that is not true. And so that is the majority of our year. However, we do like to discuss our systems. And so we do it quarterly or attempt to do it quarterly so that we can kind of update our people and also discuss kind of the tools that we're using in a way we don't, you know, we're not, we'd neither of us have, you know, an Amazon wish list or an Amazon like shopping page to get affiliate links like this is literally what we use and the way that we use it and the reasons that we use it. And that's not to get you to purchase it. To give you an idea of kind of what we're doing and maybe a piece of it will work for you. Yeah, that's, that's, that's where we're at. Yeah, so the, the goal of this is to do it quarterly. We're to just check in with what we're doing, how things have changed over time to document it. So let's start with the end of last year, which was November 28th, 2024, episode 89, the end of the year, systems check. It was basically this episode last year. It says that if I had a theme, I love how like I will be transparent. AI helped me with this with the transcriptions. I don't do themes. It's very much trying to give me a theme. It was like, Jay described his year as a rebirth. And I was like, it was not the year of rebirth. That's not, nope, not doing that. But I did say that I wanted to move heavily into CLI tools. I wanted to make the terminal kind of my home and just kind of live there. I will say I did that. I still like to this day. I'm still very much living in my terminal, doing most of my stuff in the terminal. Not everything. We're not like being like the extreme nerd here checking email and surfing the web from a command line. That's not it. But what I will say is like it kind of started to build comfort with the command line in many ways. And that led into home labbing, which is a thing that I will want to talk about a little bit more when we kind of talk about our systems check for this year. And then it says that my Hobanichi usage kind of fell flat. But I did find joy in 3D printing. Those things also happened kind of still. My Hobanichi usage was still flat. I have it open. Actually right here on my desk right next to us, what I've learned and what I've kind of just accepted is that I need to be able to write things down quickly. But I can't live in that system. Like I don't know why I try it. It's working. It's working. Life is good. Life is good. Everything crashes and burns. And things become miserable. Kathy, what about... Oh, and the 3D printing thing, I'm still literally the 3D printer is running like in the other room behind me. So like still 3D printing. I found a community of multi-board stuff. I talked about this a little bit with the episode that I did with Merlin. I am one of the subsequent episodes. I am probably not 3D printing nearly as many like a variety of things. I'm definitely not designing my own prints or anything like that anymore. But I'm still finding joy. A lot of stocking stuffers and gifts for the kids. For the little kids this year were 3D prints. Nice. You know, they find the joy in it. It's even more special to them because it's something that I physically like took the time out to make for them versus like going to a store and just buying it. Even though again, I didn't make the design but don't tell them that. I think I'm a superhero. What about you, guys? You are a superhero. Yeah. So episode 89, I talked about navigating burnout. An imposter syndrome, 2024 was definitely the year of working through burnout. I maintained my bullet journal and omnifocus while transitioning my career away from tax work. That is held true. My bullet journal has been the one true thing. Omnifocus is it's adjusting where I'm working with that. But this past year was definitely a year of growth and changing in my work and what I do. I definitely continued in 2025. Lots of changes. Interesting. So then we moved into May, which that's a long time. We skipped a year. We skipped half a year. Yeah. So six months later, we're doing our first systems check in spring in May at the end of spring. It was a busy year. I wound up focusing on organization and cleanliness. That was something I definitely remember. And they rely. And it was very interesting because I'm still I am still in the process of like how do I make things cleaner. I'm trying to do less. I'm trying to donate more. I'm trying to get rid of stuff. And I'm ultimately just trying to focus on how do I keep this house clean and organized and tidy. That is an ongoing battle. And then I also talked about kind of replacing some things and adding some new things. Like bringing Raycast into the mix because Raycast had the ability to replace a couple of tools. This was the year I gave up TechSixfander. Mostly just because I had been fighting with it. I've been having problems with it. Those problems still exist honestly in Raycast. I've actually not gone to adding. A lot of shortcuts, tech shortcuts, because again, it feels like they're just so unreliable. Like sometimes most of the time they work. But when they don't work, it's so frustrating. And I would say nowadays with both AI and with like one password being able to like just populate stuff. I feel like I've become I've needed less. Another one that I tried apparently at that time was called JJ. Yeah, that didn't last long. Yeah, no. I'm sure that if I had to do it, it would work. There was nothing keeping me in that system. So I just wouldn't. And then the other thing that I did was I got a remarkable paper pro for distraction-free notes while I was traveling and at conferences and things like that. And what I will say is when I use it, it is absolutely phenomenal. Just being able to write stuff down and not worry about it has been great. But at the same time, I haven't found myself going back to those notes. And I do think that there is a world where it makes sense too. I just don't think the pieces are in place yet. And I was as I was reading this earlier, I was thinking about like with my homelab and some of the other stuff that I was doing, is there a way that I could like download the notes as PDFs, OCR them and then store them somewhere where they'll actually be searchable? I don't know. I don't have the answer to that. So we'll find out. Oh, and apparently this is where I started building a homelab. It says it was in May. I don't... Okay, that's what it says. I don't believe it. But okay, that's what it says. Yeah, so the spring was definitely a big time like... The note says that my system is remaining in flux due to business changes. Yeah, spring and summer this year were lots of a big need to be flexible. I was doing some morning Oracle cards for some journaling focus. Obviously, Asana is a big tool for my client work and then I switched away from the cortex. What is it called? I don't know. I almost called it the homeless notebook and I know that it's not what it's called. That is not very much not what it's called. It's the home runup. It's the... What? There's not home in it. You know what? Cortex.com. The sidekick. Sidekick. The sidekick. The sidekick. No book. Exactly. The sidekick. No book. Not to be confused with the homeless notebook. That is a lot of thing. Nope, nope, not a thing. Switched over to my piano book for notes and the flexibility is a big thing. That was a big thing in the spring that spread into the summer as stuff changed around. It was really interesting. Yeah. It was this year was very, very confusing in that just so much stuff was happening. I took a look at the in-flighty and oh my goodness. I flew how much did I fly? I tell you. I had 28 flights this year. I was in the air for three days. Three like calendar days. I can beat that. I had 34 flights and I was in the air for more than five days. Wow. Visited 16 different airports and seven different airlines. 15 airports, five airlines. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was, wait, what was your distance? 55,914 miles. That's the old because yeah, you went to Taiwan. And to Prague. Oh my gosh. Yes, I think I got you next year. Not that it's a competition, but oh my goodness. It's entirely possible. 2024, I had 29 flights and 2023, I had 24. 2022, I only had seven. So like, big change. This was my busiest with the 28 flights. Yeah, oh my goodness. Yeah, it's and yet somehow we still. Yeah, yep. So yeah, all of that let's then jump to August, which sounds about right. That would have been when we would do our summer systems check. And if there was a theme, the theme was reducing over well. As best we could. Yep. This was when I rearranged my office, or in that time I rearranged my office. I remember that we did that on a co-working session. Yeah. And then I wanted to get more light in for my plants. I switched to a curved monitor. I'm still rocking the curved monitor. That is that has been something that has lasted. And then I did more consolidation of tools and raycast. And then I also adopted, click up for the nonprofit for Black Python devs. And that is still there. That is still a tool. We're not using it to its capacity yet. Like I don't think we're getting the most out of it. But I do think that it is much better than what we were doing. And it's also giving us a significantly better audit trail to be able to keep up with just all of the events. Like we had, I want to say we had a total of almost 30 events that came in requesting support. And there were like two of those that just, they got missed because they sat in an inbox. And I feel bad. Like I feel genuinely bad about that because it was just like, hey, what about this? And then I was like, what about that? And it's like, oh, that was my fault. So there is like, now we have a much better process that should help prevent that from happening. And we also have like, we have our first leadership team that's going to be using that for the entire year. So I'm really excited to see what insights and then also what like optimizations that we can make in that process after using it for a full year. Yeah. What about you? That's amazing. Yeah. I was really working on decluttering my physical space and working on my morning routine, continued using the Oracle Dex and my Squared Notebook. And then apparently it was having a lot of frustration with one password and text expander both. Summer was frustration with technology. Yes. And that was, that was a big deal. Was this a year when the hard drive thing happened? No, that was a gosh. That was maybe two years ago. Okay. Okay. Okay. It was a while ago. But yeah, technology man. Technology man. Technology man. That's a thought. Yes. Yes, very much so. So that takes us to, it says August, but I did end of the year to date summary. This was like a kind of just like a, hey, look at this and tell us what we're doing and give us an overall summary. And I'll just read it all because I think it just kind of wraps up kind of what we've been saying. 2025 has been defined by simplification and environmental control. I like that. Unlike the quote unquote rebirth 2024, definitely not my theme. 2025 sees both hosts curating their physical and digital environments to combat overwhelm. J moves from pure tooling changes to environmental hacking, rearranging his office, adding plants and acquiring specific hardware to reduce friction and distraction. And Kathy is navigating a period of career flux by grounding herself in tactile rituals, Oracle cards, high quality paper notebooks, and simplifying her digital footprint to essential maintenance tools. Both are actively reducing decision fatigue by consolidating apps or strictly defining where work happens. Nice. That, that feels like AI is giving us way more credit. Listen, I'll take it. You know what? Just not wrong. It's not wrong. It's just it's surprising to hear. And it's definitely true in like the environmental hacking is something that I am still just, again, I'm a constant fervor of trying to figure out. And the hardware decisions, I think that I have always been a person that says I will buy the nice thing because the nice thing will be better. It will be worth it. And I think that kind of continued to where it was like, okay, I need plants, but I need to make sure that my plant space is something that is nice. And like I 3D printed some wall mounts so that I can mount all my plants and put in growlites on and all these other things. And we I wound up taking an entire area downstairs that gets like the most sun and putting all of my plants in there. And it's a place that it's like I now have like this area of thought, of dopamine being able to just go in and be like, all right, let me just check the plants see how the plants are doing. And while getting sunlight on myself as well, but also just working with plants. And I can't remember, but apparently there was some study about not touching grass, but touching soil. Interesting. Yeah, the surprising health benefits of getting dirty. It's from the New York Times, so I apologize if access or if the thing is not available to everyone. But yeah, like there are actual health benefits to like getting into the soil and growing and planting and doing things. So for me that feels very much like a hit the nail in the head, but also the I love the idea of calling it environmental hacking, but I also hate it because it's like I'm not moving thing. I don't have like a ruler out. And I'm like, if I move this three inches to the left, then you know, whatever it was just like, no, just let more sunlight in. Have an excuse to, you know, touch soil and talk to your plants and you know, give them a great chance of living and don't have a bunch of junk everywhere. Like you can call that what you want to call it. They call it environmental hacking. I call it, you know, just making your space look nicer. What is both? That's that's environmental hacking for sure. What about you? Do you think it it got you pretty pretty well in the yeah. Yeah. Yeah, specifically like this past year was definitely a lot of chaos and changes and things. My yeah, this this year has been the person that I was in January is very different than the person that I am now. Not bad. Not good. Just it exists. And yeah, so we called it. We'll see what 2026 brings, but 2025 was definitely a year of changing. And that brings us to the actual systems check for right now. Cathy, how is your system? Um, great question. So glad you asked. My my system is is chaos, existing in chaos, I think. I the one the one solid piece of consistency is definitely my bullet journal. I would not be able to get anything done without my bullet journal. Specifically because so many of my tasks are all over the place based on my clients that I'm working with. The bullet journal manages to breathe, thing bring things together in one one piece of it by handwriting it down with pens on paper. It sits in my brain to remember it. And so that's how that works. Like this is, this is how it happens. And I I'm doing my best to get the things done. And in and amongst that, I'm making mistakes, learning some some good things. Learning is a bad. It's fine. Um, but in in and above everything from this past year, I've been so incredibly thankful with how flexible my system is because of all the changes that have had to happen. So for example, there was a period of time where I had to work on a PC. And that meant some of the things that I use, I couldn't use. And so I was using my iPad in different ways, which was really helpful. Uh, but I definitely meant that by having analog pieces, it was easier to move it from one desk to the other. And I liked the fact that I had it on separate desks so that I could mentally adjust kind of where my fingers went and that sort of thing. Yeah. And and so we'll see what this next year brings, but I'm going into the year hopeful in a very flexible way. I'm hoping that the chaos is less this year. And we'll see how that goes. I, I definitely understand the, the feelings and thoughts around like it's just chaos. Um, yeah. That has been like this every, every like Christmas, there are kind of two plans and plan one is like, okay, this is where we get rid of old toys. We donate them. We make room for new toys. We do that. And then like this year, I was like, I want to, I was like asking for something. I was like, where's the, the tape or the scissors or something like that? And Brittany was like, it's in the junk drawer. And I stopped. And I, I just started ripping everything out of one of the drawers. And she was like, what are you doing? And I was like, we have three junk drawers. Like in what world do we need three junk drawers? And then I just like went into the car. And I was like, I'm just emptying out the glove box. It's like, this is the junk drawer of the car. Like, but Brittany was like, I don't know what I, I don't know what you're doing right now. And like, I went through her bookshelf. I was like, why are the books stacked like on top of each other? But there's not enough space here. I was like, do you need another bookshelf? There's like a physical home chaos that is still happening that I'm like attacking vigorously. Was there, okay, I was going to say, was there anything with the, anything else in the systems check to, to share? You know, really, I, I, I swear, I do this every single time. Hey, it's in flux. Things are changing. I don't have words this time, though, on what that, that looks like. And what is, is going to do, especially since, you know, my work changed again. And so for the most part, life lives in my bullet journal. And everything else is all over the place. So we'll see, we'll see how the future comes. Yeah, you, you kind of went to the, you talked about kind of the, at one point, you had to use a PC. And I was like, are you not having to use a PC anymore? Yeah, no, I'm no longer doing that part for the company that I was working with. So I got to ship back the PC. I was very happy about that. And the changes made in, in what I, what I'm doing, it's, it's much, the work that I'm doing now for them is, oh, sorry, the work that I'm doing now for them is much more along my, like, the stuff that I do. So it's much easier for me to do. And, yeah, I'm much happier. And I don't have to have a PC. So, you know, it works out. I like it. So, so for, for me, I, I think we've talked about homelabbing and how I've just kind of gotten into it. Maybe it was a post show type thing or, or something else. But, yeah, I have gotten very into the idea of homelabbing, which the idea of homelabbing is running a bunch of different servers or systems at your home. And being able to kind of have your own, like, tools that, that you have control of the data, you have control of the network, like, you can make it so that other people can use it publicly or maybe only your network can use it. I have so many servers. And then they're all virtualized. So, like, I'm not, I'm not over here, you know, it's been in a ton of time doing things. Like, I'm not, I'm not, like, heating up a small apartment with, with computers. It's, it's just my old Mac mini. It's my old Intel 2018 Mac mini. I upgraded the RAM on it. And it's now running, if I remember correctly. Actually, why do I even have to guess? I can just log into it really quick and tell you, I also do have a management server, but I don't think it's telling me the whole picture. But I have like 12 different services running on that machine. And they're all pretty low, low usage, but there are things that like, I would rather have my own control over, especially nowadays, where like, every company is just wedging AI into everything. And I don't necessarily care about the like, oh, your, your thing has an AI component to it. What I do care about is that they're taking a lot of that data and they're training their models on that data. And they're like, oh, well, you can tell it not to, I don't trust that. There's, there's also the space around like, hey, if you actually want to use some of these AI tools without giving up some information, like imagine like, do you want to give AI access to your social media accounts? Not exactly, but I still want to be able to have the benefit of using like automation tooling and things like that. So I can have a locally hosted AI model that lives on a computer in this house, do the automating of some of my messaging for social media for like announcements and things like that. I can have, I have my home assistant now, which controls like my lights for my plants. It also does some energy monitoring and stuff. So I can see what my energy usage is over time, which is really important in the winter when like, our bills go up like 4x with a normally cost. Some of the projects that I have, I have, I mean, there's no way to set them up without usernames and passwords and things like that. So I'm hosting them on my own get server. That way I can, I should still do the right thing in terms of, you know, building secure code, but also understanding that like, if this, you know, if something goes down and I need to rebuild it, I don't have to like, I don't have to lose like everything in those processes. And then just my bookmarks and other things. Because again, I think that a lot of the stuff that's scary is that like a lot of these browsers, you can't disable like the AI training on it. So like it's going to do things, but it's going to try to go to URLs and get information. And if it like can't go to a URL and get the information because that URL is on my local machine, the good. I'm blasting. I want to say, oh, hey, I'm going to read all the bookmarks that you've bookmarked and stuff and then use that to advertise to you. Because yeah, that's the thing that's happening. So it's, it's very interesting. The different types of tools that I have running are all just, I mean, it's just such a hodgepodge of services. Looking for change detection on certain websites, like I have, I have things that I'm doing for work so that when changes happen to certain like web pages, I want to get a notification. I have that hosted on my local machine, my RSS server, like anytime I'm getting news and things like that, all of my machine. There are AI helping, like helper tools, one's called crokey that helps you build what's the word? Like visualizations, like graphic, like graph visualizations of networks or network architectures or server architectures. And that's just a thing that I do a lot at work. And I was like having to figure out how to have it generate the like images that would reflect that. And I was able to do that with with crokey. And crokey just hosted on my, on one of my, my servers and a paperless thing. Like there's, there's just a whole bunch of little things that I'm like, I didn't know that this was even a thing that I could do. But I'm so excited that now it's a thing that exists. And Kathy, I, we were talking about this because you told me about this wonderful tool called Elfster that does a secret Santa thing. I, yeah, built a my version of Elfster. And it's probably not as good. But the thing that's really cool is that it allows you to create like exclusions. So like you can have, and this was all for our game night crew. And they were like, Hey, we should do it. Like we do a secret Santa every year. And we're like, Okay, yeah, but the families shouldn't be able to get each other. Like I shouldn't be able to get Brittany. So like I was able to set that up and then make it so that like, Okay, here are the exclusions. And you have to make sure that, you know, the assignments follow all of these rules. And it also gives you email and text notifications to tell you like, Hey, nice. That secret Santa is happening in a couple of days. You should probably like, here's the description. Here are the rules. Like here's the price requirement of things. And, and it's like, it's one of those really cool things. It's like nine days out of, you're like nine months out of the year. Don't need it. Don't want to pay for it. From October to December. Okay, have it running so that I can host it just for my game night crew. And if someone else wanted to host it, it's a GitHub repo. They can host it themselves and add their own stuff. And it just works. And it's that is free because it's literally just hosted on an old Mac mini that was not plugged in before, was not being used before, was just collecting dust was about to go get recycled for zero dollars in zero cents. And I'm literally getting so much value out of it. And I'm so excited. Yeah. That's amazing. Yeah, that's great. I love that for you. Love it. Yeah. So that that has been my home labbing journey. This year, this the end of the year systems check for me. Getting ready for travel. There's going to be a lot more travel next year. It's going to be less times leaving my house, but longer. And combining like two to three trips into one, which is okay, I guess. But that also means that like I have to be a little bit more productive in my mobile, like my mobile setup than I would normally be. So I'm thinking about that a lot. Again, keeping my note, my hope in each of you just kind of open so that I can write stuff in it when I'm in meetings and things like that, but not necessarily like living in a day by day. Yes. I've been using things just to like put stuff in it like things that I need to get done. I've it was just I had it on my phone. I've just been using it. I have it on my computer as well. So like these are things that have deadlines that are very far away that I don't need to be thinking about all the time that can just sit in a tool. And then like when I open the tool about once a week, I can see those things and be like, okay, cool. I can I can go work on stuff. Yeah. So the day to day productivity is just not there for me. I'm really trying to get better at that. But I would I would love to I would love to think about my productivity more, but I cannot do it because my mind is still wrapped up so much on how dirty my house is and how it needs to be clean. This is becoming an obsession for me and I need to like deal with it. Oh yeah. That's that's I wish you the best of luck. Speaking of the best of luck, we will need luck in our connections. Our first connections of 2026, even though this was recorded in 2025. Kathy, what will be your connection going into the new year? Oh gosh. So in this past couple weeks, I went through and I spent a couple hours cleaning out half of the cupboards in my kitchen. Instead of doing the other half of the cupboards, I would like to do half of the drawers. They're basically all junk drawers. Yeah. Yeah. Some of them had purposes and then other junk got put in. So I'm going to we we've already made two trips to Goodwill. It's time to do some more. So clean out half of the kitchen drawers. That's a good one. Is my connection. That is a good one. And it's flexible as to what half means. It's okay. Okay. Yeah. Very flexible. Yeah. Yep. Okay. Cool. My connection is if I did a good job, then these will be available as this show is airing because usually at the end of the year, I announce my Jay Z's winner. Winners winners with the S. And then I also kind of try to do a Black Python devs year and review. Kind of just talking about all the stuff that happened. And then I'll do another one in May, which is like May is like our fiscal year because that's when we do like our big fundraising event. Mm-hmm. So like, yeah, I didn't realize it's December 30th as we're recording this. And that means the year is almost done. So I've got like one to two days left to do this. Now I've already done the work for the Jay Z's. I know who the winners are. I just have to publish who the winners are. And I got to write the post. I'm not going to lie. AI might take that job over. I will still write the notes. I'll still give my thoughts. But like the structure of it doesn't really change every year. So like, there's no point in me like handwriting that. I will handwrite my personal thoughts on those though because these were these were the best moments of the year for me. And this is also like I've been doing this for so long. This is I've been doing this for so long than conduit, which feels so wild. That's bananas. And then again, I need to post my Black Python devs year in review. That one is not going to be AI generated because I got thoughts. I got to get those thoughts out. There was almost almost wanted to do that in video form. But it just doesn't make sense to do it in video form. Like it wouldn't be faster. I might record it as like an audio thing and then have AI like compile it into like bullet points and then go back and write them because I just feel like I'm going to forget stuff in general. But yeah, get those two things out preferably before 2026. So again, if you're hearing this and there have been stuff on social media or my blog or whatever about this stuff, just know that that's me trying to get it done. What about arcane conductors? Yeah, Carl of all trades of the show Carl says next connection be supportive to my family as I can be while we make space to take in a classmate of my daughter to give another family breathing space as they deal with a crisis. That is a lot. I wish you the best of luck. I know what it's like and it's stressful. But thank you for giving that person the space some space. That's really really wonderful. And our checklist enthusiasts of the show Mike says enjoy remaining time off and work on my new projects, spend time relaxing and get a head start on the new project that I'm planning on launching. I want to know more and can I host it on my home lab? Our doll of the show Molly says new connection start time tracking again. Oh good luck. The, ah of the show. Says new connection. I keep getting alerts that my air tag batteries are dying. My computer mouse batteries are low and today my car batteries started to die too. I need to have a big battery. Oh no. I mean, I was going to say you need a charger. Oh, you got to finish. We need to keep a big battery replacement day because I've been putting it off. Yes, a big battery doesn't solve that problem. But yes, a big battery replacement. They would be great also, also, also, battery charging station for all the batteries. Well, that does it. Okay. Yep. Okay. Our soprano of the show demos says next connection work on performance reviews for my director reports. Oh, good luck. Sounds. I like performance reviews. Personally, I am weird. We know that. I like telling people that they're amazing. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, again, like if you have people who aren't amazing, like, then yeah, I could try to try it a little bit. But like, I tend to have some amazing co-workers that if I were doing performance reviews for them, like, I'm excited to just be like, look at all the amazing stuff you're doing. Our profane sleeper of the show, Mike says, get wife's 88 paperwork submitted. So she keeps her job. Yes. Please, please do that. Sounds important. Yeah. Good luck. Our shark of the show, Chris says, my connection for next time is to get my training back on track. After the gym has been closed between Christmas and New Year's Day, that's strange. I've never known a gym. I mean, I don't... interesting. I didn't realize that gyms weren't like open 24 hours, even if there was no people. I don't know if I'm spoiled or if that's normal. Interesting. But good luck. Yeah. That's... Yeah. The gym has been closed between that. It's just madness, like a whole week. Wow. Our mountain dweller of the show, Lo-gang says, posts a blog about my custom D&D spills, a lot inspired, minima, task, energy, management system. Again, home lab win. Like, allow me to host this on my own system, because I want to... I want to play around with something like that. Yeah. Our chief, Swiftie of the show, Andrew says, create an outline for my yearly theme, which is figuring it out. This will be a year of taking steps forward and finding my path as I go. Our nameless of the show who put their name in the thing, which has been changed to nameless. Unless there's something I missed, is nameless going back to having a name? No, no, still nameless. I just didn't change the text in this one. Our nameless of the show nameless says, I need to schedule all of this start of year team meetings. I should really change the ministry calendar to align more closely with the school year, but that will be a August problem for now. I need to get all of my teams on the same page. Oh, regarding our approach for the first quarter, I will give... I'm sorry, I want to give as much direction as I can while we wait for the 2026 calendar to be sent out. That's a lot. Yeah. Our robotics engineer of the show, Aiden says, next connection, still taking time off. I'll have something next time. Yes, love it. That's the perfect excuse, because it's not only excuses, it's the next planation. And then our attack podcast listener of the show, Pillik says, enjoy the holidays. Probably start looking for stuff to set up, step up, self-hosted server with a friend. Sounds like you're going to be home-loving.

Plus, add free episodes when we have ads, and a co-working session in the off-weeks with Kathy and Jay and other superconductors. I, they are just as much the stars of the show. Oh, absolutely. You know, again, we are going into what will be our fifth year of conduit. And like, it doesn't exist without our superconductors. Y'all are like the energy of this show. And if I can't say anything more than anything at the end of the year or the beginning of next year, I guess, thank you so much for making it another wonderful year of conduit. Kathy and I have talked so much about the chaos and the hecticness and the travel and all the madness that goes on in our lives. I can't speak for Kathy, but I can say for myself, conduit every other week is a highlight of my week. It is a highlight of my months. It is a thing that I look forward to every single episode. I would do these more and more and more if it may sense for us to do so. But I again, just thank you so much for all of that. And I guess lastly, if you want some merch, you can get some conduit merch. Go to YukonWarrit.com. That's YukonWarrit.com. Get some conduit merch. And again, thank you so much for being super awesome. Hey, Kathy, did we do it? Heck yeah, we con did it!
