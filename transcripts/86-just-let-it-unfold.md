From really FM, you're listening to Conduit, the show where we condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that says, let's give this a go, shall we? This episode is brought to you by E. Cam.
I'm Kathy and Jay is off galavanting around the world again doing his thing. And so I brought in someone else with me and that someone else is the, oh my gosh, what is your title of Cheat No, but...
Oh Cheat Cheat Cheat, do you know what for a second I was like, what's my name? You should know that by now Kathy. I was gonna actually introduce you as like what you do for relay and I realized that I was like, wow, I... My brain just crashed and burned, but that's because... So, Cheri... Cheri...
Cheri... What? Welcome to the show, Cheri, she does something at relay, it's not confirmed what the... She's saying really bad. Cheri provisano, the chief advertising officer and I'm sure I totally messed up your last name, but that's okay because I love you. You did it. I did it right.
It's provisano. Okay, amazing because my brain always like second guesses words and names that I have seen and written and I've typed a million times. And then I have to say it out loud and I'm just like, oh no.
Yeah, I think you just have to go with confidence and yeah, hope for the best with this. And apologize if it's right. I know that. Yeah, excellent. Yes, okay. So, yeah, welcome, Cheri, I'm so excited that you're here. I'm really excited to be here. Thank you for having me on the show.
Lily, absolutely. All right, so we are gonna get started with the exciting things that happened in the discord. We are now in happy holiday Halloween season, which some people hate and some people love. And I love it.
I love the incredible names that discord like that people put for their discord names for the spooky season. I also love that we had some celebratory end of podcastathon timeframe, which is always fun. We had just like some really great like energy and vibes and so much love over in the discord.
And then we also last week in the co-working session, we discussed this whole second moon situation. Did you do you know about the second moon and like what happened with that? No. The fact that like the earth basically captured a comment was like, hey, you're my moon now. Okay.
It basically it messed up people's brains to like, you know, you know, how people are like, oh, yeah, the moon is in Pluto or like stars aren't like very not constellations. Oh my gosh, whatever it is, where you're vibes, your energies off. And it's like, we're just gonna blame the second moon.
Oh, okay, go ahead. Yeah. So basically people weren't sleeping, work isn't working like any of this stuff. And I thought that was that was really fun. And so yeah, our our our co-working sessions happens for our superconductors.
Since conduit is a fortnightly show, we decided that on the off weeks, we would come and hang out with our members. So every other Tuesday, we hang out on zoom. And yes, work does get done. It isn't just sick sitting and like chatting, but most of it is.
And so a lot of us will do some like just vibing together. And it's really fun. And if you want to join us for our next co-working session in the off weeks with myself and Jay, or hang out with us live as we're recording in the discord. You can visit I am a superconductor.com.
That's letter I letter M letter A superconductor.com to become a member today. And yes, so it is mostly chatting. Thanks for the lie. Thanks for for calling me out on that. But yeah, it's a lot of fun. It's a lot of fun. And we would love to have you join us if you are interested.
One of the things that we like to do every so often is doing a shout outs. And that's where something that has happened in our world, in our life, in the community that we want to call attention to. It comes in this space.
Before I say anything, do you have any shout outs you want to give, Carrie? And you go first and I will have to go. No, it's totally fine. It's like, hey, here, let me explain everything to you beforehand. And then, oh, just kidding. I am going to count count.
Wow, I'm doing really, really good right now. You're doing great job, Kathy. Call me. I'm going to call out as a big shout out to our Canadian trivia card enthusiast of the show, Erica, who was so willing to come and be a guest host here, just in case we needed to.
But then couldn't, but then I had also forgotten that she had already hosted before because, okay, so I thought that she had come and guested with me. I was like, oh, yeah, totally. And then I looked at the spreadsheet, like at the website. I was like, oh, she's not listed.
So clearly, I just dreamed it. And then I was talking to her. And she's like, oh, yeah, it totally was. I was like, oh, well, then I need to fix the website. So that it actually is done properly.
So yeah, it was this whole thing just to say, like, I love when something happens that you think didn't happen, but did happen. And then you get to just fix things. And I, like, it's fixed. It's done. It ended up not working. Erica to come anyways, which was great because I get carried.
And like, just all of the things aligned to work the way that it was supposed to work. And Erica, I'm glad that you're here today in the last game. Kathy, can I just say that that happens to me quite regularly. And I'll tell you, I'll tell you the way which it happens to me. Oh, my goodness.
So I will, I will say something to Mike. And I'll say, oh, yeah, because remember, I said about this. And he's like, nope. I'm not like, oh, never mind. I dreamt that I sent you a Slack message. And it's not actually there. And I've done that as well with emails.
I think to myself, you know, that sponsor hasn't emailed me back. And I sent that good three days ago now. And I checked my sent folder. I didn't send it. I dreamt that I sent that email. And I think that's it's a really good litmus test for me.
For when I know that I need to spend a little bit less time working. But I'm just dreaming about basic things like Slack messages and email. Yeah. And that one hundred percent. And I think that it affects the real job. Because it's such a real dream. That you think that you already did the stuff.
Yes. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. I'm stuck there like they haven't even up the back here. What an earth is going on there. That is so funny. Oh my gosh. Yeah. And now now it's like, all right, we're good. Where's that? Oh my goodness. Oh, good now. Hilarious. Absolutely. Hilarious.
Well, do you happen to have a shower and it's okay to say no? I don't think I do. I'm sorry. I was like, I was too caught up in what you were talking about. And I forgot to think of my own. Nope. Totally fine. Because sometimes we don't do it at all. It's all good. It's not a big deal.
It's only when something happens. That's why we have it in the spreadsheet. And if we decide we don't want to, we move on. Because guess what? This is our show. And we could do whatever we make a rules. Yeah. I don't make rules. So I just follow the rules. That's what I'm interested in.
You can make new rules. I'll let you make rules. As long as you don't swear because then Stephen gets mad. I will do my best. The problem is, swear words are different between the US and the UK. So I catch myself sometimes. Oh, that's a curse word in the US.
But some of the good ones are all universal words. Yes, no, that's very true. That is very true. All right. Well, it is now time for our connection check. For anyone that doesn't know, because we have, do have some new, lovely listeners. This is where we are holding, each other accountable.
So we're going to check in on what happened in the last fortnight. Let's see if we got things done. I can start. I got a big green check mark because yes, I did in fact pay the people that I forgot to pay last month. So I doubled up the payments. Sent them off. They're very happy.
I love it when I could do the bare minimum of my job. I'm just like, what's the problem? What about you, Carrie? So for me, it's just been about catching up on my inbox. My inbox was overflowing. And it felt like I was having more emails come in than I was dealing with. And it was stressing me out.
And normally I'm very on top of my inbox. The way that I tell if things are out of control or not is whether or not I can scroll. So like when I have the spark at open on my mat, if I can scroll, I don't like being in scroll territory. It means there's too many emails.
So I spent a good chunk of time getting the email inbox in order. And it is now in order. And it stayed in order. That's my favorite thing. Once it's in order, the emails that come in, I can just deal with them and they go back out. And it's, it's harmony is restored.
So it's a big green tick for me. I'm glad to say amazing. Absolutely amazing. All right. Let's go on to our conductors. Like this one weirdo whose connection. They're the host of the show. Jay, I guess he's important. I don't know. But he's got a bit green check mark. Dex, we're cleared.
Can't wait to hear more about how that all happened. But for now, let's just keep on. The next one. Yeah, absolutely. So we have. Harley Knight art who says I went with you networking events. I'm not sure if anything will come from them. But I managed to leave the house, which is always a win.
And that is a green circle. Yeah, it is always a win if you manage to leave the house, especially this time of year when it's getting darker. And it sounds like we're going to be talking a bit about networking stuff later on. Yeah. Yeah.
In the post show, we're going to talk a little bit about what Carrie did today. In fact, our new conductor, Christina, with Canadian flag. Christina, let us know what your of the show name you would like to be.
You would like to be put her first time connection feels ambitious with my current schedule, but it's worth trying. I got a government grant. Yay. But now I have to figure out how to budget and use the money. Weird problem to have, but the issue is I want to spend on more than I'm given.
So I have to prioritize and figure it out. And it turns out connection check was a green circle because she did in fact actually end up deciding on what to spend the money on. But now I have to actually wait for the money to come in. But good news is you know what it's going to go for.
And so that is super exciting. Welcome, Christina. We're so excited to have you. Right. Should I take the next one, Kathy? Yes, please. Okay. Cool. We have Carl F. Wolfe, who says I did self reflection and figured out what the eyes and how a matrix.
I was wondering if I could have a better look at my brain was asking for. Unfortunately, I don't remember what quadrant that was, but that's next fortnight's problem. Also, I proofread my connection check so I don't embarrasses myself again.
Is that deliberate there because they said they proofread it. And then we have embarrasses. Let's just say that it was deliberate. Very, very well done. It was such a funny joke. Good job, Carl. Yeah. Very, very well done. And also that eyes and how a matrix is excellent. Yes. Yes, it is.
Maybe one of these days we'll talk about that in the future. The Canadian trivia card enthusiast of the show Erica says green heart. I played seat saber. That's beat saber, but sitting down pretty much every other day. And most importantly, I kept it to only two or three songs.
This is such great progress. I'm so proud of you. Shark of the show One-Bout-Sews says playing a little catch up from a few connection checks. I got my car washed a couple of times. I also got my office cleaned up. It still needs some organizing, but I think that it is functional.
Yay, functional office. Amazing. Our soprano of the show Debo says connection check, green heart. I mostly delegated yard cleanup to my husband, but I also made phone calls and talked to an actual person twice when the waste management company kept missing our yard waste pickup. Well done.
Especially getting us rude to talk to people. Like that's impressive. Good people in there. That's top level people in here. I hear, let me switch. You don't have to do trouble maker. There you go. Do this one and said. Okay, all the words just changed in front of me.
Okay, fish bear of the show says routines for the kids are mostly good, but you know kids do kids stuff. Expectations are set at least. We have a yellow circle for that one. I think that's still. It sounds like some progress has been made, but. Yeah, absolutely, which is incredible.
Are you out of your mind? I'm not going to say that. I'm not going to say that. Which is incredible. Are of the show. Okay, a trouble maker. A connection check, green check mark, the coffee table mount doom doom pile. That's a registered trademark plus a regular trademark has been vanquished.
I have a clean clear coffee table once again. Congratulations. There's nothing better than flat surfaces that are actually empty. Yeah, I agree with that actually. Yeah, it's rare. It's like it's yeah, it's how you know that like your life is in order is like the coffee table is clear.
For me, the dining table that's that's the big one. If the dining table is clear, things do in order. It's really. But it's a dream. It's a dream. Yeah, I think I know I'm a connection for the next time it's going to be.
Oh no, no, because now I feel like my needs to be the dining table being clear. And I don't want to I don't want to sign myself up for that because. Well, see that's okay. That's why this is great because you can put it on a dream, but not for your actual connection. Yeah, that's a good point.
Yeah, I'll do that. Okay, points in the US of the show reads says I've missed a couple of connection checks and still failed to even start with my outdoor driveway landscaping project with a red. But hey, sometimes that happens. Yeah, absolutely.
Besides, you had very important things like getting engaged to happen. So like goodness. Yeah, priorities are important. Yeah, yeah. Our index. Our index. When of the show Aaron pumpkin spice McLeod green circle. I did the thing, but going to not give details for the show.
If that's okay, but I do appreciate the love and support the discord has shown me. Absolutely. I want anyone to know that if you put in a connection or any sort of comment. You only have to give the information that you want to give. This is for accountability and for support and stuff.
So you can even like this was a perfect example of like, look, I did the thing. I don't need to know the thing to be here to support and like give you the love that you deserve and are worthy of receiving. So well done on whatever it is.
It doesn't matter to me because you did it and I am here to support that. Yeah, good job. Okay, robotics engineer of the show is a yellow circle and says I managed to do some extra exercise, but work has left me too tired to do much of anything when I get home recently. Yeah, I feel you, Aiden.
That is the downside of this time of year. It's a little bit more snoozy in the evenings. Yeah, especially because it's so dark. It's starting to get dark in the morning and dark earlier and it's just like, oh, I could get out of bed. Or I could continue to stay snuggled under the blanket.
Yeah, debatable. It's hard to say. Yep. Our checklist enthusiast of the show Ghost of Ping says green check mark keep working on office as time permits. Mostly done just need to do some cable management in the less visible areas.
Well done and also well done doing a green check mark on that because you absolutely got that done. Fantastic. Tech podcast listener of the show says miss pillix is feeling better. She is done with remaking her resume.
I worked on pod shift at least twice, which is more than once and I did a fighter jobs green circle. Yay. Our Oracle of the show. So. Has a red question mark. I needed a little mental health break from everything while navigating some ableist procedures in my new job.
I'm mostly proud of looking after myself also yay new job question mark. I'll be excited as soon as the ableist nonsense is out of the way. Lord, how do you yes? I am so excited for you to get done with that junk and and be able to do everything that needs to happen.
And finally we have the nameless of the show who has a green circle haven't bought the new computer yet because we are hoping the new mac rumors are true. But I have the computer we would want in the car if there's nothing coming soon. Perfect. Absolutely perfect.

All right so you are here miss carry I am here and we're so happy for it and there's so many things so many joyful your journey this last year has been epic I think is a good way to put it.
You've been doing just a little bit of school little bit of writing little bit of podcasting and by little I mean epic amounts of all of that why don't you give it a busy year yeah why don't you give a little bit of intro to anyone that maybe doesn't know.
Yeah sure so alongside my work in the advertising department relay I also a couple of years ago decided that it would be a good idea to do a part time master's degree so that's what I've been doing and the beginning of this year I spent doing two things actually.
 Planning a podcast and making demos because I've had an idea kind of knocking around in my brain for a while that I wanted to do a show that was focused on writing because i'm always curious about writers and like how they write not necessarily what they're writing about although that is always interesting but okay you've written this manuscript but how did you do it did we're doing it in the mornings we're doing it after work you know what how did you did you use the pomodoro technique like I think it's a really fascinating.
 Area of productivity to hear about how people produce their writing work so I had an idea around that so I was making demos I was trying to refine the idea and alongside that I was writing my dissertation for my master's degree which is a master's in creative writing so it was a very busy time of year that there was there was no real output and then it was around I think may time when I launch the show paper places here on the market.
 Relay and then shortly after handed in my dissertation so it kind of there was all the prep at the beginning of the year but nothing was kind of out in the world and then all of a sudden everything was out in the world and my dissertation to be submitted and the show was had been launched and was going and I was seeking guests and recording new episodes and yeah and then since then so now that my dissertation is handed in I am kind of free now I guess to keep writing.
 So I've been I've been writing solidly for well I've been writing solidly since I could basically order crayon and scribble nonsense at primary school but I was writing consistently throughout the master's degree but none of it was being published because it was all being handed in for my assignments and I was kind of still figuring out what my voice was and who I was as a writer I used to be a newspaper columnist until my sort of mid 20s and I gave it up because I I thought that there was like a bigger project that I could chase but so long as I was writing the column I was never going to do it so I knew that I had to quit the column and I've been doing it for 11 years so it was it was a difficult thing to quit and people were kind of like what why are you why are you doing that why are you leaving your newspaper column but I knew that I had other creative projects in me and I also knew that the column was providing me with just enough satisfaction creatively that if I kept doing it I wouldn't pursue.
 Something bigger by way if you can hear a cover poo barking at the top of his voice in the background can you hear that copy I can't know okay okay fine maybe maybe my microphone isn't picking it up but there is a dog that is barking very loudly it is mine it's not a neighbor's I can't blame the neighbors.
He's very he just wants to be a part of the show he's he's a passionate boy and he is he's feeling some type of way something so I don't know what that is but if it continues I may have to go and put him somewhere where he won't be heard of him that I just heard.
 Oh you had that okay yeah oh man do I need to go and move him I don't I'm gonna have to know listen we had a baby on the show with Maddie oh really oh yeah yeah what was that connection check uh you know it to grow I'm sure like to continue to use diapers like yeah yeah chaos baby chaos you know continue to cause chaos it was great it was perfect so really I don't think yeah just like I'm gonna do it.
So said can do it is real life and that includes dogs freaking out sometimes so don't worry. Okay okay cool we will we will leave him yipping away in the background hopefully that will it could be that there's a cat in the garden so hopefully that cat will he's got to protect his baby yard.
I'm pretty sure.
 I've where were we caffeine what were we talking about we're on the show you were talking about after everything launched everything everything launched yeah yes everything was out in the world and my dissertation have been handed in which meant that's what I was talking about the Newt paper column yes I had an opportunity to then start thinking about okay what do I actually want to publish outside of the degree so I've been kind of working on that so I started writing on my sub stack a little bit more regularly and I'm also working on some extended creative writing projects so I'm working on a manuscript at the minute or a memoir that is based on my childhood in mid-meet gymnastics and I'm also hopefully going to write another manuscript in November for something completely different I want to do a romcom so yeah fiction I've been wanting to do it for a while and I figured this is a good time of year get it done before Christmas and yeah just just see just see what happens if I if I sit down for an hour a day and give it a go so yeah it's been it's been a wild year and then of course we had all the stuff with Rela as well we got to hang out in person we have London we have the podcast of dawn it's just been it's been a busy busy time but it's been a great year we're all I feel like it's it's been good stuff yeah yeah definitely it's definitely been like the year of like absolute like new experiences I feel like like going having the live show for Rela and actually being on stage this time for me new yeah um getting to I mean me you was new and amazing uh that's so funny to me that it was new because it didn't feel like even we saw each other in person it didn't feel like oh I didn't need to you for the first time right because we talk so much but also you're so much littler than expected everyone says this like you're so tiny you're half a person I'm sure yeah surprise surprise just well especially since so everyone else uh in relay we're all around six foot and so you're this tiny level tiny little version it's adorable by three baby yeah yeah because you're shorter than my mum yes yes I think I was I had a great time with you mum by the way we were sat in the box it was so it was fantastic so glad I was so glad that you were there with her she had a great time she absolutely adorzo I told her that I was getting to podcast with you and so she says hi by the way oh please have my surprise absolutely absolutely yeah so so okay so with a year like this how how do you like not continue on because that's not the way but like I know okay so at one point I was working you know so many different jobs trying to make something work something clicked to make it all happen and then once things got settled I had a hard time not at that not being at that same level of like productivity because I had fewer things that had to get done yes which then threw off everything and I'm wondering if you're kind of in that same like obviously you still have plenty to do this is not an indication of like okay yeah you're going to go sit on a beach and do nothing but like it's different times of things like different yeah yeah yeah how are how are you feeling yeah it's interesting you say that because it is different isn't it there is a big difference between being compelled to do something or being you know being productive because you want to do your own side projects I think those are two very different things and they can have their own challenges part of the reason I wanted to do the masters is because after I quit my column I didn't write anything for about a year I just had no I had no deadline essentially so I didn't do it and that made me realize oh okay if I want to produce things then I need a deadline so part of doing the masters was I need to have these deadlines to get me back into it again and once I'm into it again I think then I'll get some momentum and that is exactly what happened so I feel as though the workload has definitely gone down in the sense of you know needing to do assignments and the assignments were made of they were made up of two parts a creative writing aspect so depending on which semester it was that would either be poetry or script writing or fiction or nonfiction and then we also had to do a critical analysis essay to go alongside it which was a bit more of a traditional academic essay that needed to be submitted alongside the work and having those deadlines meant that I was always writing and always busy on something and they were quite quick turnarounds as well so I would go and study for the week and then I would come back and I would have like maybe three weeks until the the deadline for the thing and it would be you know maybe four thousand words of fiction and then I think a three thousand word critical analysis it was quite a tight turnaround time for seven thousand words of you know what was expected to be highly edited and high quality academic writing and creative writing so all of that to say it it was a time of lots and lots of deadlines and as you can imagine the outcome was it was quite stressful but I did get the things done because when deadlines are there it encourages action right and since handing in the dissertation I did wonder okay what's this going to look like you know how do I how do I keep writing in a way that is enjoyable and not just about meeting deadlines but also if I just give myself deadlines is that we need to work these were kind of all the questions floating around in my mind over the summer I took the summer off from writing I was like I'm just want a total break I'd been buried in the dissertation for such a long time that I just wanted to step away from it because I knew that I was going to come back to it to continue writing it into like a full manuscript so I needed a break so I did that and I came back in September and essentially what I've done since then is kind of impose my own deadlines but deadlines for important things so for example I could have gone one of two routes here so I could have said oh well I want to write 500 words every day and I have to do it no matter what and you know be really prescriptive about it that sort of thing doesn't really work for me so what I decided to do instead was pick first thing I did was pick a creative writing competition which is called the Bridgeport Prize which is an international creative writing competition and that had actually been put on my radar I think last year by my tutor at Cambridge she mentioned it to me so I had that noted and the deadline for the memoir category was helpfully at the end of September so I was like okay this was great I can come back I have a deadline I need to meet I can approach the work however I want to I knew that I needed to do some edits and I only submitted 5,000 the first 5,000 words so there was a bit of like editing and making sure that I had everything that I wanted in that first 5,000 so that deadline has just gone and now I am October is a kind of in-betweeny month for me where I'm hopefully going to be writing a manuscript throughout November and the first two weeks of December so then this month for me is now going to be about planning that manuscript and planning out the scenes so I still have deadlines and that is what is kind of keeping the momentum going for the writing side of things because that's the part where that's the part that I dropped right like after the masters it's like that's the bit that's gone so I am doing less but I wanted to keep up the writing so I needed those kind of deadlines imposed but not not they they needed to be real in some way and then after that after the after the manuscript is done then I'm doing a couple of couple of other things involved with like pitching to agents and getting the manuscript out there and seeing if I can get an agent for the gymnastics memoir so I think for me the key has been to allow myself to take that pressure off because that's a high-pressure environment environment like working full-time and doing a part-time masters that's a lot to do and anyone listening that has had that juggle of studying or doing you know a side project or anything else alongside working full-time or even part-time that is a juggle and it's it I think sometimes it's okay in short a burst so I kind of accepted that okay for two years this is going to kind of be a little bit wild and then after that I allowed myself that break and I think actually that's probably the difference between me now and me and my early twenties is in my early twenties that I would have handed in my dissertation and I would have had one day off and then I would have been like oh my goodness right I need to start getting this out to agents right now I wouldn't have given myself any breathing room so so yeah I think it it hasn't really been too much of an adjustment because I've been quite easy on myself and I had a really nice summer just letting myself not right I mean I actually did still write from time to time because there was things that popped into my mind that I wanted to jot down but I didn't kind of force myself to do it yeah that's that's so I mean you're comment about like personal deadlines that you make yourself I feel you so hard on that I am terrible because if I make it myself well then clearly I don't have to do it because there's no external obligation to it yeah yeah yeah so I love the idea of finding something that works to fit a deadline that then you can that it's it's a real deadline because somebody else made it but yes it's one that you picked to take advantage of I think that's yeah smart and I think something else to do another thing that you can do as well is to tell people your plan you don't necessarily have to tell people exactly what you're going to have done and when but for example I'm telling people oh I'm gonna be writing the manuscript in November and December like I'm telling people there isn't an actual deadline for that I'm just telling people but that's what I'm doing and then it just becomes part of the conversations like how for people oh you've still planning that manuscript and and it feels it feels like there is a deadline because I've kind of set it but I'm talking about it so I feel a bit more accountable for it in a way yeah yeah because you don't want to make anybody sad because they're asking you a question you said oh no I haven't done anything but that might be my own that's my own right I feel like that is quite a human thing though like if I said someone house this and they went oh I still haven't started it part of me would think fair enough yeah there's a lot to get done at all times yeah well it's so funny because I have I have a couple clients that I feel like our our meetups are like hey just checking on this thing they're like I haven't done it yeah that's cool I'm just gonna continue checking on you to see if you are gonna get it done but you know if you don't that's fine too but hey yeah I'm not gonna let it disappear yeah yeah yeah that makes folks sense yeah yeah so big big transition has been happening and you know you're you're you're vibing you're hitting that energy how like obviously you're feeling pretty like good about the future right like you're you've got this you got to handle on this you know what you're gonna do um have you given any thought to like what that next thing is when okay you've turned in your manuscript you've got an agent like what like what's next so I really like to like have this kind of like radical nonchalance about the outcomes of things so my approach to these things is to do the work but I don't know what it's gonna look like like I might not get an agent like the project that I'm working on it might end up being it might end up being like a serialized memoir on substack it might end up being a series of personal essays that I pitched to the Guardian all the times it might end up being a radio um segment that I pitched to the BBC like I don't know I feel like I try not to attach too much to the outcome of the work versus the work that I'm doing if that makes sense yeah so actually really calee you're so smart because I think it's no go ahead no yeah okay I was just gonna say that I think it's just I think I've just learned that from experience that things don't necessarily you got like I I can't plan what's gonna happen and I I could underestimate it I could overestimate it yeah and if I underestimate it then I might not it might not be as and this I'm talking really generally here like in terms of planning for career things I think if you set yourself to prescriptive goals you can end up underestimating what you're actually capable of or you might overshoot having not understood the industry properly at which point you might get halfway there but feel disappointed that you didn't reach a certain point so I think something that I've learned is it's it's okay to like it's okay to go in blindly and not know and I think again going back to quitting the column that's exactly like what happened like I have nothing lined up I quit the column everyone was like oh but you still gonna be writing what you're gonna be writing and my answer was I don't know I'll figure it out and and then I didn't write for a year but I just had that kind of like internal trust of yeah but if I don't want to write right now then I don't have anything to say that's fine too and then you know I then thought okay maybe I could look at master's programs that might give me some deadlines that might be the thing that kind of reinvigorates me and then it kind of happened naturally I mean I didn't think I would be going to Cambridge University like I never would have predicted that I went to I went I didn't go to Cambridge or Oxford for my undergraduate so I didn't even think that was an option for me you know I was the first person in my family to go to university so I did not think that I could go to a university like that at a master's level so I could have had some ideas about after the newspaper column what am I gonna do next and I could have written some things down and kind of started to work towards it I never would have written down to do it creative writing masters at Cambridge but I just kind of like let it go and just let go let go of the outcome and just let it unfold and I think that is kind of how I approach career things now which is very different to in my early 20s I was very much like this is what I want and this is how I'm gonna get there and that did serve me but I don't think that would serve me next because I don't know what's gonna happen next yeah there's something really powerful of being able to and you know I talk about vibes and energy a lot I'm not super woo woo and yet there's something to say about the universe will put in play what you need to have like things are gonna happen the way that it's gonna happen oh yeah sure and you never know what like hiccups or roller coasters or anything that's gonna happen that's going to make it difficult and definitely not be what you expected it to be I mean it's in a month will be my 14th we call it the stroke ofversory of when Ryan had their massive life changing world altering stroke that caused everything to go into everything I could not imagine at that point or even right before it happened where I'm at now like yeah I I cannot even fathom that person that was happening beforehand with who I am now um and a lot of that has to do with like okay what is the universe gonna like what's gonna come into my path what's gonna what's gonna become available and keeping your eyes open still like communicating and working towards things but also being ready to accept things that maybe aren't exactly what I imagine but like okay yes the vibes are good on this let's try that yeah let's see what this happens let's see what this works to do um and I think that's there's something powerful in being able to like be flexible oh I like that so follow the light yes not in a you're you're in a coma and you're gonna follow the light everybody like not continue to be living but yes follow the sparkle maybe follow the sparkles follow the glitter let's follow the glitter let's follow the star light I don't know we'll we'll we'll workshop this we'll show well yeah find the joy finding that that thing oh yay so sof is this is their uh yearly theme you're following the light and I love that and you know you do a lot of work with cortex too huh I do yes yes I do I think I think the themes yearly themes are kind of the same energy of you're gonna pick not a goal not a not a like a tangible this is what it's gonna happen but you're gonna pick the vibe of the year I'm sure Greg would absolutely vomit trying to like use the word vibe in a sentence how much to sneak vibe into any of the copy I have to say yeah well you know what that's your goal that's your goal for the next year and just I will see it and I'll be like yeah carry did that good job but yeah you're totally right though it like it's it's very similar because themes they're not they're not about the outcomes they're about doing the work and seeing what happens along the way yeah yeah and and I think that's so important especially as we hit this last quarter you know if there's all of the prep work like what's gonna happen in the next year like let's get done with 2024 I'm over it 2025 it's gonna be my year it's like okay but we still have we still have months like come down we still have so much time but also like the everyday is important to pay attention to and get that energy and like don't forget today in the hope and like planning for tomorrow yeah I really don't I really don't understand that whole mentality that comes around this kind of time of year of like oh it's new year new me and I know I know it's cliche to even say I don't identify with that new year new me but I but people do it but it is still so much in people's vernacular like towards the end of the year like it really is the thing that people are talking about what I want to do next year and it's like I don't know like I've got I've got no clue what I'm gonna do next year I think you can still do the work like you can still you can still do you know actually this reminds me of something but I used to do when I was younger so this is like I was cortex brand before I even knew it this this is about 15 and I was starting to I think it was actually around the time but I started writing like and getting writing published and I kept finding myself thinking oh my goodness that's so cool I can't believe that was published there and oh my goodness I've been published again this is awesome so I decided to start writing down in the back of a notebook all the things that happened that year that I never would have expected and I ended up with just this really long list almost like a reverse bucket list for the year and at the end of the year I would read back all the things that I wouldn't have believed had happened and and I did that for a few years and I think that kind of really tuned me into you never know what's gonna happen like you just don't know you can't you can't prepare for it and I think that it's interesting when it comes to productivity um because I think it just kind of removes the I don't know not the importance of goals but it I think it's good to reframe things in a way that makes you focus more on doing the work and not the specific outcome like if my specific outcome was I have to have my book published then I might miss a really good opportunity to turn it into a radio show like you know I you don't know you don't know what opportunities you might miss by by being too blinkered I think that's where themes work really well because if you become too blinkered on and this was one of the examples that we used for 12 days of themes um on the cortex brand social media at the beginning of the year um the year of reading you know let's say you want to do the year of reading um but but but a version of you before that didn't know about themes you want to read 50 books this year and you're going to read a book a week well maybe sometime around the spring you start reading some academic journals that are really interesting and then you're like oh no no but this isn't a book quick let me pull myself back towards books right not to meet my goal you've actually missed the point because you're now you're just trying to meet a prescriptive goal of reading 50 books and you're missing that your brain is pulling you towards these academic journals and they're enriching you in some way because you're drawn to them yeah so that's why the year of reading makes so much more sense than I want to read 50 books because you can't predict where your brain is going to go and what it's going to do yeah one of my uh one of my youtubers that I follow does a lot of like planning and bullet journal stuff um and one of the things that she's done is instead of a reading journal because she's like I want to I want to read more but I'm I know that I'm not reading enough to make it worthy of a full like journal that's because she's a slow reader and it takes a while so she's making a stories journal and so any uh magazines that she reads any books yeah but also like any like TV shows or movies that she watches these are also in there because it's all about the story and it's all about like kind of that enjoyment and that joy of things and I love that idea of like being okay to reformat what you know is quote unquote traditional or like what someone else might be doing especially as a content creator I can imagine that she's got a lot of like influence of everyone around her is like oh yeah I'm doing a reading journal and here's the 30 books that I read this month yeah definitely like trying to figure out who you are as a person and what you need to be successful and then that will help better identify what being successful actually is yeah and I think as well it's so important isn't it to to do exactly what you just said which is to go against the norms of the things in a particular community like reading is such a um the reading community is very numbers driven and actually people always really support people will often ask me oh how many books you try to read this year what's your reading goal for the year and my answer is the same as it always has been which is zero like I I I'm not that I don't have no wait that sounds like I'm gonna try and read zero books that's not true I don't want to read anything no don't have a reading goal and I don't I don't I don't even really fully understand them to be honest like I can I guess I can kind of get my head around wanting to have read 20 books in a year in order to push you to read but at the same time like I don't track the amount of TV shows I watch I don't track the amount of films I watch like reading is a really enjoyable thing but I do why would I why would I like set a number to it and then berate myself throughout the year and I think like good reads has there's always like a number on good reads and then I don't I don't even know why I think mine says like 20 or something I don't even remember putting it in but every time I open it it's like you're one book behind goal and I'm like no I'm not I've read how many books I read I'm not I'm not behind goal on anything I'm just reading like you wouldn't tell someone that's watched however many movies that they need to watch more movies to meet a goal like it's I kind of think it's a bit ridiculous like reading is supposed to be this pleasurable thing and instead there's a lot of like I'm reading 50 books this year I'm like okay but are you enjoying them all like I remember thinking that for the first time um when you oh someone's just said on the discord that you have to put a goal and if you want to see yeah that that's that's why I did it then Erica because I didn't wonder why there was 20 on now I just put in like an arbitrary number um oh yeah Erica's also just said I put something arbitrary yeah yeah me too I because I'm kind of curious at the end of the year all I've read this many but there's no like I'm not bothered about the goal but yeah I remember seeing like a book who said once that she'd done this video about um books to read to meet your reading goal by the end of the year and it was like really short books that were like less than 100 pages yeah I remember thinking wait am I missing something yeah like that seemed barbaric to me that you would just read loads of short books like I feel like I maybe I'm missing something coffee please tell me if I'm missing something here but why would you read loads of short books to meet a reading goal if those short books aren't what you want to read in the first place have I missed something or is that like not the point of reading I think I think the problem comes and this is something that we've talked about like for productivity like people like who make their content to be productive is like if you are a booktuber and you or like book talker or anyone that's going to like I am making content or I am like having to fight to get this thing they want to get it and they want to get it done and they want to do it successfully to talk about it okay well let me just like pat on this this thing so there's a level of like I need to prove my worth as a reader and yes just like yes Erica I'm fine reading a bunch of short things to meet a goal but only if they're things I wanted to read in the first place yes yes to like get it done there was a period okay this is we're gonna we're gonna turn this apple tech focus a little bit I had filled all three of my rings for like four months before I realized I was like oh it's actually happening like let me like let me make this a goal yeah and then like I would get sick and I was like okay well I'm gonna do meditation so that I can close my exercise goal I can I'll put my hand down when I'm sitting so I don't have to actually stand up so I'll still get my stand like tick it's cheating is the wrong word because there's no like true like end goal or like validation or proof of getting it done at the end of the day but it feels it's so inauthentic in a way that feels really gross yeah I think I and just to say that like I don't think there's I don't think we're doing anything wrong like that's the I if if you are someone that has maybe been attaching too much to the numbered goal of yeah like I want to close my rings this many times I want to read this many books or whatever it is I don't think that I don't think it's humans fault like I think that it's I think it's the fault of the the apps that we use and the tech that we use it's all geared towards giving us that that reward cycle of oh I got a dopamine hit like my book just went up by my book count went up by one or I got a dopamine hit I close my rings so I don't think it's I don't think it's our fault when we feel ourselves being pulled towards that but I do think it's interesting when you catch yourself doing it when you catch yourself going oh I'm going to meditate to close this exercise ring and then having that moment of wait a minute I'm a grown woman I can lay on the sofa because I'm not well like I don't need Tim Cook's little ding to tell me that I'm an active person of course I'm an active person but you know that I think that is just what happens sometimes when you get in that kind of reward loop yeah your monkey brain kind of is like oh this is what I need to do and and yeah you'll see other people do it or you'll you'll figure it out how to do it yourself and you're like oh well okay let's let's just do this then and yeah there's nothing there's nothing inherently wrong about any of that because guess what life is not all about like it's not black and white there's always shades of everything and so I think it's important to kind of sit with like why are you doing something and if it's because you want to do it I have to freaking loop it like yes go for it but if it's if you're doing it because you think that you have to do it or you should be doing it maybe take a moment to be like why what yeah and like obviously things like I don't know doing dishes in laundry and in like taking care of yourself please drink your water that's one thing I'm gonna like bully you into I'm glad you said please drink your water and not please do your dishes because I was like no I can't go and boil it up yeah yeah no that's okay like I'm cleaning so much I do too that's why my kid does our dishes that's their job that's their task so I don't have to do them but yeah drink your water say hi Drayden eat food and you know do something fun for you I think it's just about like not putting the goal over the experience like I think it's totally fine if someone says yeah it'd be really cool if I read I read more books this shit like it'd be really cool if I did read 30 books and like kind of had that in the back of their mind in January but I think it's the the the pursuit of it has to be 30 that can then interrupt the I'm actually enjoying reading these books like you have to think about when you tick that box is it just the box that's ticked or have you actually had a good experience doing the thing so Kathy for you it's interesting about I've totally got caught in that before with closing the Apple rings um and and then now I'm like so not bothered about it like yeah I don't even know what my calorie goal is because I don't even think I'm eating most days and I'm just so unbothered because I just realized at some point oh wait I like I remember going for a long walk once and then realizing that my Apple watch is dead and I was like really annoyed and I thought oh that's bizarre that's bizarre that I'm annoyed about that because I have just been on a walk I have had I have had all the health benefits from it but I just I haven't tracked it and that's when I kind of realized I think I'm a bit of a little bit too much into this little this little square on my on my wrist here I think I can care less and still be still be active yes yeah and I think I think that's something that I'm also working through like my brain is like oh well I got I got to I got to close it I got to I got to oh there's no there's no physical way for me to do my stand to finish my stand goal because it's almost midnight and I don't have the time well what if I just you know back back fill um by putting in a one minute or two minute exercise that goes from 59 to 6 oh like to a one so that it's like yeah it's just brains are weird and they're gonna do what they want to do yeah so true yeah well with that are we ready to is was there anything else you wanted to to discuss or talk about before we move to our next connections I I think we're going to go to the next connections fantastic what's your connection for the next fortnight so I need to plan this manuscript um it's because I I want to get the writing done um in this kind of six week time frame so I need to be pretty I guess prescripted we've I like how we've just talked about looking to gold I will point out if I if I happen to write three quarters of the manuscript in six weeks I will not consider that failure I'll be like I just wrote three quarters of the manuscript so you know golds are arbitrary as long as you realize that then you can use them to get your work done but you don't need to beat yourself up if you don't if you don't meet them so yeah so I want to do some planning for the manuscript plan out some scenes plan out the plot um plan out the characters and yeah do that over the next couple of weeks so that um when november and early December rolls around I am ready to go and I know what I'm going to be writing each day I love that I can't wait cannot wait to read it uh my connection is uh to clean off the dining room table that is where our folded laundry goes and why is it so difficult to take it off of that table and put it into the drawers no idea are it sort of all goddess of a cleaning lady does our laundry for us uh and fold it and put it on the kids dining room table and I'm so thankful I'm so happy uh but yeah I need to put it away um could the connection be ask the goddess of the cleaning lady to put the laundry away no because she already does so much um okay you can't you can't add to it and and there's a layer of where mini soup is now some of the clothes could be mine some of the clothes could be uh yeah yeah yeah mr soup some of the clothes could be there like it's it'll it's it'll it's it's actually easier to just have us put it away but yeah that makes sense yeah yeah all right so our next connections for our conductors j host of the show next
