From Relay FM, you're listening to Conduit, the show we Condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduid. Or is it Roboism? No, no, it's the pit show. No way, it's connected. Oh wait, no, I made a mistake. It's totally Conduid.
The show that makes mistakes and isn't afraid to show it. This episode is brought to you by micro.blog and ecam. I'm Jay and on the mic with me by no mistake. At least I don't think it was a mistake. The one, the only, the Kathy, the Campbell. Hi, Kathy. Hi, Jay. I hope it was a mistake this year.
I've made a lot of mistakes regarding like interviewing people in the past. I'm just like, hey, I'm sitting in this call wondering where you are. Oh, you said it was next week. Oh, I did not. Right. Well, I can't do it next week because that I know we're going to be talking about mistakes today.
But before we do all of that, I want to tell you about what happened this week in the discord, which was a mistake because Kathy's going to tell you what happened this week in the discord. Heck yeah. We learned that we learned a lot of facts about giraffes. Very important.
We learned that it's bad to drop babies. And there were a ton of reviews and thoughts and questions all about the Appalachian Pro. Of course, including some really, really creepy images from the personas, which I don't know about you, but to me, it looks like they're like ghost projections.
I was going to say it looks like the in memoriam like, but the projector is going out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And someone cut the light on their bad. They're real bad. They are interesting for sure.
Hey, Jay, what happened in the co working? So as folks who are amazing superconductors would know, the conduit is going to be in London for the relay FM switch on 10 year anniversary. S. Draveganza.
And we learned to to some of our friends who are who are on site that there are a lot of conduits in London. Some of them are conduit conduits. Some of them are restaurant conduits. Some of them are coffee conduits. And some of them are our rival podcasts. conduits.
So we are figuring out what we could do. Maybe a meet up, maybe just a tour down conduit alley or conduit avenue, which or is it conduit way? It was one of those basically we're going to be doing conduit things in London. And we talked about them during our co working session.
And if any of that sounded like a fun time because it was you should definitely become a member today visit. I'm a superconductor.com letter I letter M letter A superconductor.com to become a member today.
You not only get access to the amazing discord and the co working sessions that we have in our off weeks, but you also get access to the pre and post show. Kathy, I want to do something a little special.
I want to say during the pre show, we talked about how some people are gone and possible business ventures. And what do you do when you just want to dance, but the power is out.
How do you dance when there's no power? And then in the after show, we're going to be reviewing as I tell us some of the greatest mistakes ever made in the history of the world. So yeah, if any of that sounds fun, become a superconductor today. I'm a superconductor.
com letter I letter M letter A superconductor.com and become a member. I think it's time for the connection checks. Perfect. Kathy, how did you do? I've got a big red X because not only did I not swap the legs in my desktop, I did not even move the boxes. They are still out in the hall.
How did you fit a how did you fit legs in your desktop? I mean, is it a large PC case or a small one? Oh. On my sit stand desk. How about that? I read that in my at my first thought was like, did someone make a was it a Christmas story computer? It was just the lamp. Yeah, nice.
I pick it up with your put down now. If someone if someone has a lamp computer, a lamp leg computer, please send us a picture. I want to see this. Oh, so you didn't get the legs. I did not do it. I know I still need to. I still want to. Obviously. It has just been. It has been a conduit. It's.
Say so. It's been. It's been a month. I mean, we're in a new month. It is February now. I mean, my goodness. January. I don't know why every year. And I know the memes were strong. But January felt like an entire year. It was the longest month. And I am glad that we're finally in February.
But yeah, it was it was a lot. Yeah, I mean, I think it I think it impacted everyone. Yeah, everyone was just like, oh, wow, there's there's a lot happening in the world, in the weather. And it's not done yet. So yeah, January, January kind of sucked. Not going to lie.
For me, I was supposed to make an appointment to look at getting our floor replaced where we had some water damage. Sadly, they thought they fixed the water damage. Water damage to electric blue. I actually know water and electricity should not mix.
So turns out our the water tank in our refrigerator had a crack in it. So every time it filled up with water, it would leak, which is why every time we ran the water in our refrigerator, it felt like there was no water in there for a few seconds before water would finally come out.
So that being said, I've got a way to get a new. They got to replace that part. And then I will be able to actually fulfill my conduit. So not my fault. But at the same time that didn't get done. And to be honest, I totally forgot that it was my con my connection. So yeah, there's that works.
What about our conductors? Yeah, Laura are pathologists of the show has a green heart. My connection was to find a way to bring random one off tasks with no due date to the front of my mind regularly. So I will actually do them. I have them on list based on big areas, CIDO, admin, personal, etc.
So I designed one area to each day of the week, put a repeating reminder in my calendar to check that list with the goal of either doing one of those things that that day or assigning one thing a due date for some time soon. It's worked for a week and a half. We'll see if it sticks.
That is a brilliant idea. So exciting. I can't wait to see it continue to work. Our tech podcast listener of the show, Pillax says connection check green circle. I managed to survive for two weeks. And I did send a bunch of applications out way to go. That's awesome. Hey, our panda of the show.
James says green check mark to birthday celebrated in the last two weeks, two more to go in the next week. It's all a bit hectic. But the vision vision pro shipped and people have said nice things about using peak health on it. So I'm generally feeling positive on the downside.
My eyes are playing up some more. But I have an appointment in a few weeks. I should do something that people could say nice things. Oh, wait, I do a podcast called conduits. Yeah, I was like, what about this thing that we do? I'm not begging people to tell me that they listen to my show.
Our identical twin of the show, Aaron says green check. My manager was pretty open to me picking up things to keep busy while in between other tasks. I have been able to move forward on some projects as well, which feels fantastic. Hey, that's, that's cool.
And I'm glad that you have a manager that was really supportive. Canadian trivia card enthusiast of the show, Erica says green heart. My new paper calendar system for food exercise planning is a hit.
I even decided to change the color scheme every month because it means more pretty pens and maybe newer more neuroplasticity. I love that idea brilliant. I love the fact that Google said that colored was spelled that color was spelled wrong because it's from a Canadian. Oh, the you.
Oh, you are soprano of the show. Debo says green heart. I had a really great vacation in Iceland. I'm glad. Our shark of the show one pair of shoes says connection check. My connection was to commit to working out four days per week minimum.
It doesn't matter if it is running weight training or yoga, just get intentional movement in my day. Green check mark. Thanks to being able to do some simple exercises in my hotel room last week. I was able to hit the goal. Yes. Excellent. Our wait, I lost it. Oh, no, I lost it. I lost it.
I lost it. I found it. Our fish bear of the show. Fishy guy says connection check yellow circle. I partially succeeded in the conduit of health only because I exercise right before writing this. Hey, I stand by it that doing connections are great because sometimes you're like, oh crap.
I got to say whether or not I did that connection. And then you immediately do it right there before you're supposed to report it on whether or not you did the connection. Like, hey, that just perfect. That is that is executing on connections flawlessly. Exactly.
Speaking of executing connections flawlessly. Our artist of the show Carly has a green circle. I applied to at least one job every day this last two weeks. Perfection. Our tire advocate of the show Chin Toss says green heart.
I finally managed to get back up to two runs a week for the last couple of weeks. Hey, way to go. Excellent. I'm out in dweller of the show. Logang. Logang. Red X connection check. Life happened and I didn't get any writing done at all. That's okay. Welcome to the red X club.
Logang and I are deviating from our we are the same person because I actually wrote stuff which is so rare for me because I don't write I ate blogging. But I actually wrote stuff. I wrote a lot of stuff. I even wrote a newsletter thing. Goodness.
I did more writing than I like to at any given point. Clearly are the same person you just stole all of the writing energy for yourself. I did all the writing for Logan. Would you share it with him please.
It's going to be funny when Logan and I look exactly alike and we figure out it's like this orphan black thing that happened. Yes. Meanwhile, our training enthusiast of the show, Ralezi says green square no longer sick and I've continued to not be sick. Good. You've listened finally.
Just did a one hour 10 minute technical interview which has wiped me out. So maybe I'll be listening live. Maybe not. I think you're here. It depends on how long I'm at for. Hopefully I'm successful.
Although the six to nine month waiting period between successful and actually getting the job means that maybe a short term job is needed. Yeah. That's that sucks. I don't I don't have any other words other than that just sucks.
That's I'm I'm sorry that you got to deal with that and my current employer has kind of a similar process which is frustrating. To say the least. So yeah, I'm sorry that you got to go through that. This episode of God knows brought to you by micro dot blog.

Good job. Oh, you didn't say thanks at the end. I make mistakes. It's fine. Speaking of mistakes, I think we all make mistakes. We wanted to talk about mistakes. Kathy wanted to talk about mistakes. Did and also good Lord. Sorry. Hold on. I have things beeping, which is another mistake happening.
All the mistakes. We should have Javier just not. Yeah, Javier, taking the game. So I mean, still do the pre the post show pre show thing, but yeah, you know, I love that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the okay, this topic came up because at the first competition of this conduit, it was solo and duo's only.
And the number of mistakes by the host team, like for tabulating and announcing. Like winners was. There were a lot. Okay, this is the same competition that last year. They lost like judges scores on paper. They just like didn't have them. So nox was announced first in their division.
And yet somehow the third place winner received second top overall score. Now, you don't have to know anything about dance to know that something wrong happened. If a third place winner gets second top overall. Like that. Matthew, Matthew.
Yeah, I was going to say I'm not a I'm not a mathematics person, but I understand I know in the math don't be math and that math a math. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So it's.
They handled it fairly well in that we have a competition at the same location later on and they're going to announce because knocks actually got that top that second place top overall score. First and third were all seniors. So as a freshman for them getting that score is really impressive.
And it's really sad that they didn't get that kind of, you know, public announcement part of things. But it comes down to making the like admitting mistakes recognizing that it's okay to make mistakes. It's normal. That's what happens in life. But not.
Not necessarily like throwing somebody under the bus, but also taking accountability for what happens yourself. I think the interesting part of this that often gets missed is when a mistake is made. Often you're thinking about how it affects you and not necessarily how it affects the other person.
If it doesn't impact other people. I have I was just talking about this person or a person that I'm about to talk about yesterday. I don't remember the context, but we had this I had this marine that was really, really good. He was a really good marine.
The problem was is that in order to fix something, he would break it. So like there would be a problem. He would break that problem even worse, but then fix his mistake and the subsequent problem.
And it was it was like this moment where you know, it happened probably in the in the two years that I worked with him. It probably happened like three times. And it was it was one of those moments where naturally that's that's what he became known for.
But also there was this this reality of like how broke is it before we broke is it. Like how broke did it need to be before we like said all right go in there and like take a look at it. Because hold on let me send an email saying the network is going to be down for about five minutes.
But it's definitely those moments of like you know, we're only thinking about solve the problem, solve the problem, solve the problem. And then the mistake comes in and it's like there are active costs sometimes sometimes there are like dollar amount costs to mistakes.
And the earlier that they're owned and the earlier that they're discovered the less expensive it can be the less impacting it can be. And often the less damaging they can be especially towards like relationships like if if I make a mistake.
If I don't address that I made that mistake and apologize for it at the end of the day that person may be like oh that person just didn't like me and like no it's not that I didn't like you just made a mistake and you know I'm sorry. How can we work to make this better.
Yes, yeah, and I mean this is something that every time I do an initial phone call with a potential client, we always start like one of the biggest things that I make sure to talk about is that mistakes will happen. Period.
That is pretty much the only guarantee I can bring is that stuff will go wrong, especially when you're taking stuff off of someone's hands that have been done that they've been doing it for maybe years and handing it over to somebody who using their operating procedures.
But doesn't really understand it yet like that plan and simple it's going to happen however the other thing that we do is we always make sure to state that hey. We will let you know as soon as it happens.
And do our best to fix it and like not try and cover it up or lie about it or like anything like that because that is not. That's not helpful for anybody.
 It does not solve a problem and you need to be able to fix a problem but also by knowing that it's going to that mistakes will happen and try not to make the same mistake again that's the other part is like learning from these mistakes I mean that's that's a thing that's stated all the fricking time is oh but we've learned from our mistakes.
You can't just say it though you have to actually do it to. I think this is where you know i'm leaning into the developer world a lot right now just as i'm thinking about transitioning jobs and some other stuff.
One of the things that another thing that happened a member of the community that I'm a part of recently was guessing on another discord channel and someone rushed into their little their stream called the person a slur and then like dipped.
And naturally in that moment there was like this huh wait what just happened like but what was interesting there was that the organizing team had an opportunity to do what they thought was the right thing.
And their right thing was hey look we ban that person are you okay do we need to reschedule this we you know we just want to make sure that you're good if you're good we can continue alright cool. And that was it now.
People listening would be like oh okay well I mean they were empathetic it seems like they gave a good response seems like they handled the situation.
But there was a mistake in there at least in my eyes there was a mistake in that they didn't address how does this even happen how do how do we even get in the position to where this is possible to happen and can it be prevented in the future.
How do we make sure that that mistake never happens again and then also giving the person who was affected by the mistake the comfort in knowing that hey we not only have addressed this situation we've done the work to make sure that in the future.
This can't happen again and that's that to me is like there's a difference between being like oh hey I made a mistake you know all mistakes happened that it's like no no no no. Sometimes a mistake happens a mistake just happen.
Yeah but if you don't stop even for a second to go how did this mistake happen and how do I now prevent this mistake from ever happening again and I'm sometimes you just can't do that.
How can I reduce the number of times that this similar mistake like this could happen this was this is something that I mean being a parent we teach our kids this all the time. Oh hey you burned yourself how do we make sure that you don't burn yourself again. Do it again.
Yeah a part of this is on you that you shouldn't be doing things that are going to cause you to burn yourself but a part of this is also on us to make sure that like we keep hot things away from you. Right.
Yeah and and giving structure to the reason I'm like why something happened hey this you burned your hand because you didn't look and saw the you know light on it that says that it is on and hot like this that happens you know we've been working on driving in this household because someone is now.
License well a permitted driver and let me tell you it's scary but. Kathy I'm so proud of you for getting your learners permit. Thanks you know I'm really proud of myself it took many years but we made it.
But there's there's a sense of pride in seeing that many soup has not made the same mistakes times like they. Excuse me. They like we were driving around in a parking lot and they took a turn very quickly.
It made the adjustment in the future for future turns and since then they haven't really made those types of that's almost that exact same mistake like it's.
It's terrifying but they're working on it and that just like with anything else that you're doing you have to work on it and playing a ukulele with a silly song is not the way to apologize for. Thanks and.
How is this the second time that that's made an appearance on the show because it's so ridiculous. For those that don't know a YouTube. Person supposedly allegedly not supposedly allegedly made some.
And so it's like a lot of mistakes for incorrect like inappropriate contact with children and a variety of other things and in a form of apology and admitting of mistakes. She wrote played a ukulele. Basically not holding countable. Fine moving on.
I think that there is not not trying to piggyback off of that because the gross. But I think that there is something to say around. Making a mistake trying to do the right thing to. Yes.
I mean I will say one of my biggest mistakes was I did things way too long like I should have given up on them much sooner. But like just out of like no I can make it work no I can do this and just be like no just let it let it go. No no no no no no no no no no.
Okay so you can make a reference to the incredible and I can't make a frozen reference. That seems like a mistake. One was iconic the other one was a stupid song they got overplayed. Has it's iconic. But anyways moving on sorry. But I.
I think that there's there's one kind of last part in here that you know someone was beating themselves up about the mistakes that they've made. As we're talking about all of this. How do we how do we work around other people's mistakes with.
I want to say like grace and not out of like like how do we how do we make a mistake an easier thing to be resolved. Then like the hey looks like you made a mistake there let me help you with that.
Because people people deal with being called out differently and sometimes it's not even a calling out it's more of like a hey look I want you to understand that your mistakes came with actions and came with like consequences that affect more than you.
But also it's better for you if we can just move like fix the issue make sure it doesn't happen again and move along. Yeah and and this is something this is something that I think really is difficult to do in practice and easy to know how to. In theory.
No as a human and I'm going to assume right now possibly incorrectly that you're. Most likely that everyone listening to this is a human. I mean actively listening to anyone that chose to listen to this is a human there may be dogs and cats and horses and pets or whatever that are.
Get them a phone and tell them to download the podcast and listen on the right time. Yes. But they. Everyone makes mistakes. If you think that you don't make mistakes you are lying to yourself and you should go to therapy. I mean everyone should go to therapy but. Anyways.
When you see mistakes happen. Especially ones that can like really affect your life. You want to make sure that you are giving that level of grace that you would like to receive yourself. I'm helping people recognize mistakes is good. But making sure that you are giving them.
Kind of a level of not control necessarily because they made a mistake but like the support that they need meeting them where they're at giving letting them know that you're here to help and not be a jerk. And seeing if you can support them to help and not happen again. Yeah.
And I think as a salient wrapping up of. This topic like. Your mistakes are for you to own. Those mistakes while they may affect you are not yours problem to own down the road. And I say that is as someone who often gets because of just I do work for a community of historically excluded people.
Like I get told all the time that what I'm doing is a mistake. Funny enough the people telling me I don't care. So just a reminder that you know a mistakes are sometimes based on perspective.
When I was in the military I thought a lot of the decisions that were being made on my behalf by my superiors were mistakes. And I was like, well, once I got promoted I realized, oh, no, there's a method to this madness. It's still a mistake.
But like they didn't really have much of a choice in implementing this mistake. They were just doing what they were supposed to do. So again, to the people that keep yelling at me that what I'm doing is a waste of time or whatever like stop.
And also understand that you just because you may be thinking that what I'm doing is a mistake for my career or mistake for whatever reasons.
I have to then also agree with you on this and then move the process along and and go through all of these steps that we were talking about of like, okay, if it truly was a mistake.
And then one is kind of like, all right, figure out who is impacted by this mistake and make sure that they know that, you know, one, I'm apologizing to I am going to resolve the issue and three, I'm going to work to make sure that this issue doesn't happen again in the future.
But then also like if it's not a mistake for real, don't don't sleep on it too hard. Right.
And and the other part of that is, you know, once you have made, made things to where it that same mistake is not going to happen again, you have worked with and apologize to the people that it impacted and all of these things is to not take it to.
To heart, think and to to recognize and acknowledge that you are human, that this is probably going to something is going to will make a mistake again. Period, that's just. And how it works.
And as long as you again are doing everything that you can everything within power, not make mistakes, the same mistakes and to grow as a person and to grow as a human better, you are doing a great job. And because of that, we love you. Well, and we love you. Mistakes and all.
Yes, mistakes and all we love you. Your mistakes don't mean that we don't like you any less. It just means that we got something to work on. Great.
And you know who else is doing great?
 A, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a Kow is it easy to use.
What did you, how do you do with your ec camps? I've had, I've done 3, 4 live streams now using ec camps, and I mean I'm in, I'm all in like I canceled my Stream Yards subscription. I am ready to go. I.
One of the things that I want to highlight specifically is how easy it is to do some of those things that you see that make a little bit more polished.
I used to always just be like a ball of stress and anxiety on my streams because I was like, I need to make sure that the audio is routing through this channel using this piece of software and these other tools.
And then I also need to make sure that, oh, how do I make the timer to account down thing or do I not do a timer account down thing? Like Ecam has a built in timer feature where you can just say like, hey, I want to start the stream in this amount of time.
And then when the timer goes up, go to the next scene and I'm there ready to go. It also allows me to easily do some of the things that made StreamYard kind of the end between the like nice, I can go between and highlight people's comments from different chat platforms.
So whether I'm ice stream on Twitch and YouTube and you know, you always get that weird moment where like you get rated on Twitch and people in the YouTube chat have no idea what's going on but all of a sudden you're like, ah, what's happening?
Like you can make that process much more visible and easy and still like bring things in so that everyone's together on this.
You can also see your analytics. I got rated by the Panatic podcast. There was a lot of people in my Twitch. I was not prepared for this.
But at the same time, like it was great because in that moment it was captured and all this stuff was happening, I still felt like I was in control of my stream and I was able to do my best work. So shout out to Ecam, like definitely going to like keep using this.

I don't know what mistakes are out there. Yeah, this is a weird one. What connection do you have for the upcoming conduit? Yeah, I am going to fix the mistake from the last conduit and change the feet on my desk because I want to stand again.
I've been scared to move it to standing position because it is wobbly and so I haven't stood, which, I mean, there's a reason that I got this desk and that's standing. And I also want to get a walking pad for underneath it, but I can't do that until I actually stand.
The hard part is is I also need to clean my office so that I can access it and do it at a time that mini-soup is available to help me flip it because it needs a second body to help move it. So we're going to redo last conduit's connection. We will help Kathy to stand again. Yeah.
I mean, stand forth. Be strong. Stand up and fight. Oh. So I thought that was going to give me time. It did not give me time. I'm starting a new job. So as this gets released, I have less than 24 hours left at my employer, my current employer, which I think I've mentioned it before.
I work at Microsoft for three more days. So yeah, I'm going to be taking the week off afterwards. And then I will be starting at my new gig, which hasn't been announced yet. So I think for my connection, it's going to be relaxed. Don't do it when you want it. Never mind. The song. Yeah.
I think it is going to be like, hey, get rested, get ready. There's a lot of stuff happening for me. Kathy, I've already told Kathy about some of it. Like some big things happening in my career that I'm super excited about.
A lot of the stress that I wind up pushing to the fall, I think is happening like in the summer this year. So I got to be ready for that. But I also want to make sure I actually had someone reach out to me earlier and ask me how my mental health was going.
And I was like, ooh, I appreciate your call. That's a great question. Like, I don't want to answer that. But that's a great question. So yeah, I think, I think, relaxing, having a relaxing conduit, especially with the second half of that conduit being in the, like, I actually know.
Yeah, I will have only had one day at my new gig. So yeah, that's definitely going to be the ticket. Nice. Thanks. And then our pathologist of the show, Laura, says that her connection is the flat of Georgia. Hey, I'm there to hang out with my best friend.
Is it me? While she gets her first ever tattoo. No, not me. And enjoy catching up. Also try to keep, also keep trying not to get too far behind at work. Everyone was sick in January. And there's lots of snow days, which meant I got behind.
So just now feeling caught up, and I'd like to stay that way. Mm-hmm. Our tech podcast listener of this show, Pillik, says, new connection, keeps sending applications, and figure out taxes. Send an email to thank the interviewer so that I might get more chances for the job.
Even though I probably will get news this week. Keep looking forward and have hope. Don't know what else to put. Yeah, that's what this was perfect. The exact perfect comment to do. And we wish you the best of luck. You got this. I forgot taxes are things still.
Yeah, why don't they just go do it for us? Our panda of the show, James, says, new connection, continue the birthday celebrations. Get my eyes checked out. And I think I should have a bit of a break. Hey, me too. Yes. Break. Way with us for summer. Let's go upstate.
All right, our identical twin of the show Aaron says, new connection, book plane tickets, and start on the train tickets for my relay 10. Plus UK visit. It's planning time. I should probably get on that whole planning thing. What's going to happen? It's going to happen.
The Canadian trivia card enthusiast of the show, Erica says, survived Gala Frey won the annual Doctor Who Convention in La. That's La. Yeah, when you're from there, that's what they call LA, Los Angeles. And treat myself very, very, very gently.
I don't have to do everything or even much of anything if I'm not up to it. That's a good thinking, good mindset to go into the event with. Absolutely. Our soprano of the show, Debo says, next connection, add in some core and strength workouts to my fitness routine. Good plan. Core is good.
Do you work core? Core is good. There's a podcast on this too called core. It's pretty good too. Our shark of the show, one pair of shoes says, my next connection for next time. Nope, my connection for next time is to get up without using some sort of snooze function.
Daily during the work week, this will help enable me to have time to do the keystone things that I will get my, what that will get my day going with less stress. Oh my gosh, for the record. That was written correctly. The mistakes were from Jay just putting that out there.
But moving on, fish bear of the show, Fishy Kai says, new connection, continue the conduit of health and actually make some sort of exercise a regular thing. Yes, makes a movement. Our artist of the show, Carly, says, prepare to meet with a potential client that I will be building a website for.
Nice. I wish that a certain company would be sponsoring us so we could say, hey, you should build it with them and use our keyword code.
That's okay though, because our entire advocate of the show, Chief Thassas, next connection, stop procrastinating and book an appointment with my accountant before I missed deadlines. Yes, please, your accountants will appreciate it.
If you book your stuff and send your things and get that done, I know it's scary. I need to find an accountant. Hey, I, I, okay. Our mountain tweler of the show, looking. Look at. Next connection, more specific this time. Interview both parties and finish the outline. You got this me.
Our train enthusiast at the show Rails E says, new connection. See what the job interview comes out. Otherwise, more applications, more recruit events, more existing, keep on existing, dude, you're doing great.
And our nameless of the show nameless says, find a new coffee grinder as my current one is finally broken beyond repair. Nameless, reach out to me. Let's talk about this. I love coffee. I love coffee grinders. We can, we can make this a conversation worth having.
I mean, you can talk to me too, but my coffee grinder was like $15 off of Amazon. So probably not what. As soon as we get off the phone, I'm gonna make some more coffee. But if you would like to submit a connection, you can do so in the relay of them. Switch on, Discord.
