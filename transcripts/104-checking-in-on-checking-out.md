Hey friends, this is Jay and Kathy Kathy's here but Kathy. Hi. Yep.
 We are talking about how we are dealing with some of the stuff that's happening in current events, whether we are talking about the situations with ICE in the US, whether we're talking about our government, whether we're talking about all of the stuff that's happening over in the Middle East right now.
And we're also going to talk a lot of things in how we may or may not be interacting with them all.
If you're not in a space to necessarily be challenged on whether or not you think that Kathy and I should be spending more time and energy or focus on some of these things or maybe we should be spending less than we are. I don't know of a nicer way other than just don't listen to this one.
Check out the connection checks and then check out our ad reads because we have fun with those two. And then just skip on right past the main topic. We're going to try to keep it nice and light but also we're not going to sugarcoat things. I don't want to sugarcoat things.
I'm going to try to sugarcoat things. Yep. And from Relay F.O. you're listening to Conduot. The show we Condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Yeah, with that being said, welcome to Conduot. The show that has sugar has coats but is too tired to combine the two.
I am Jay, a staff product advocate on the world of technology and stuff. And with me is the internet's busyness unicorn. Hi Jay. Yeah. I'm going to say your title because I still don't know exactly what it means but that's okay because it's not for me.
We're going to learn it together but I'm going to give them the habit of saying it more. I love it. I love it. I love it. Because earlier I introduced myself and then had to go that's not what I am. Yeah. And you know what? I'm going to come out here too.
I help small businesses get their stuff together. And if you are a small business or if you know a small business that could use some help send them over to the unicornsidekick.com. I love it. Hey, this episode is brought to you by P.
The hydration app is what it says in here but I'm just I'm happy that P is back sponsoring. Yeah. So hey, this we do these things in the pre show and the post show and in the pre show. I talked. Wait, what? Did I talk about Pico 8 in the co-working? Yeah. Did I really? Yeah. Oh. Well, cool.
I also talked about it at the beginning of the show in the pre show. So yeah, that would be super awesome. But then also we talked about some of the tools and imagine what it would be like if Cathy could only do photography with an old school film camera. Well, you don't have to imagine too hard.
Just listen to the pre show. But in the post show, we're going to talk about another super awesome conduit productivity like topic, which is decision making by committee. Cathy's got some cool insights on that. But cool is very relative. Okay. Cathy's got some insightful conversation. Very good.
Too big to that. Cathy, what happened this week in the discord? Yeah. But the macOS beta, I don't know if you know this, but there was this big like event that happened recently for dub, VV, XX, nope, that's wrong. For WWDC happened.
And there was a lot of conversation, specifically about the finder icon and how ugly it was. And then they rolled that back. And I think we can thank the suit Stephen for that hard hitting journalism that really made that work. So good job, Stephen. I haven't looked at this.
The finder icon was ugly. And now it's not ugly. The biggest thing was like it was backwards, but not because I was just wrong. So, I don't know. Cathy, there is a genre of video on the, in the internet that are just like Instagram real comments.
I've been watching a lot of those and I will say like some of them are very, very mean. These are mean spirited people. People are, people are the worst. Although they are incredibly creative at times. And I saw this finder icon. So, you can be accurate. Yes.
I saw this finder icon and I was like, that looks like a person with it. That looks like Zuko from Avatar The Last Airbender. Like, there's like the birthmark on the face. Like, that's what that looks like. This person has a very horrible birthmark. It's what I see. But yeah. Okay. Cool.
I'm glad that Relay. So, change has happened. Yeah. I'm glad that the Relay community led by its leaders were able to bring about this change. And if that's not how it happened, I'm shut up. That's how it happened. Yeah. That's totally how it happened. I mean, that's how it happened in my mind.
Yeah. Because that was the only conversations I really saw about it. So, obviously, that's accurate. 100% and we're good to go. What happened in the co-working? So, apparently, I talked about Pico 8, which is a virtual console that I have developed a game for.
And again, if you want to know more about that game and why I made it and why it's important and why it's not like a new thing that I'm doing. Well, it is a new thing that I'm doing, but I'm not like doing it for money or anything like that. Again, I'm a superconductor.com.
But then also, apparently, I made fun of Canadians. I don't remember making fun of Canadians. I don't at all. And then we discussed the genealogy of Super Mario characters, which is super, super pertinent because Kathy, did you hear, did you see all of the Donkey Kong stuff? No. Oh my goodness.
So, okay, tell me. New Donkey Kong game coming out. Like next month. Because of the Switch 2. Because of the Switch 2. Donkey Kong Bonanza, the best-selling game on Amazon at the present time.
Apparently, Pauline, who is, Pauline was the original person that Donkey Kong kidnaps in the original Donkey Kong.
Apparently, kidnapping is not the right phrase because Donkey Kong and Pauline team up and are very good friends and have been very good friends and work together to solve this problem. Now, there's a whole bunch of, like, cannon stuff that's happening.
Like, how is there a young Pauline? But this is an old Donkey Kong and the original Donkey Kong is actually Cranky Kong. Like, ignore all of that aside. This further proves my point that Mario is actually a bad person. I mean, I, I love this idea.
It really goes into kind of this trope that has happened a lot. Recently, Maleficent is one of those things where, like, the villain is not really the villain and the hero is not really the hero type of a thing.
I'm thinking of, once upon a time where Peter Pan was the bad guy, like all of these things, you know what, it tracks, let's have the monsters, you know, take over and you're not evil just because you're a monster. Or that your skin is darker than the heroes. I'm just throwing that out there. Yeah.
Just throwing that out there. Yeah. Do what you want with it. Just a, just a comment. Um, so yeah, if any of that sounds like a fun time, which it really is, it genuinely is, you should join us by becoming a super conductor. You can do so by going to I'm a super conductor dot com.
That's letter I letter M letter A super conductor dot com and become a member today. Kathy, we got some shout outs for our last show that we did on privilege. Yeah.
Uh, Mike, our profane sleeper of the show says I didn't get to finish the episode while I was in the car for the live episode while I was in the car, but I really enjoyed the discussion of privilege.
And then our identical twin of the show also, Aaron says really great discussion over such a difficult topic. Love you both. Thank you, Aaron. Thank you so much. Um, for those comments, you know, we, we did discuss like it was, it was, we knew it was going to be a hard topic.
And so we appreciate y'all sticking with us. Um, and being there. So thank you. Yep. And then, um, our checklist enthusiasts of the show, Mike also gave a shout out to our member special, um, saying that it's gold.
Um, I, I listened back to it and I was like, Oh, that, that J character so unhinged like definitely, definitely could do without them in the next one. But other than that, it was fantastic. Um, but no, it was a fun time. Yeah, it was a lot of fun.
Um, and the good news is is you don't have to be a member of, uh, conduit to listen to it. It's for all members of relay. Um, and so super fun. Lots of enjoyment. Well, we highly recommend it. Uh, just being a member's fund, you can be a part of the discord.
Um, you can only be a, uh, join us for, uh, our co-working. Uh, if you are a conduit member, um, but yeah, we really hope that you, um, yeah, listen and enjoy. Yeah. The insanity, the chaos. Yeah, we really hope you liked it and subscribed it. Um, ding, hit that bell.
That's time for our connection check. Uh, Kathy, how'd you do? Yeah. So I am giving myself the orange circle. Um, my desk is not complete, but I have been doing a lot more like calling, but also reconfiguring. So it's taking a lot of energy, especially since it's been so flipping hot. Oh, yeah.
Heatwave. Absolutely disgusting. Um, which means I haven't been able to be in my office.
 I've done a lot of work from the couch, uh, including the co-working session because I cannot run the air conditioner in my office and also have mini soup run the air conditioner in their bedroom because of, uh, popping the, the thing, um, the circuit, the circuit pops and it, it, it is what it is.
It's fine. Um, but that just means I can't run it in here. Their room is higher priority when it's a bajillion degrees. And so, um, right now, I, I'm hoping it goes away, but if not, uh, we do, I am running a fan in my office right now while we're recording, which I normally try not to do.
But again, it's a bajillion degrees. Um, and it's only going to be like 85 right now. It's not that, um, let me see what the temperature is right now for this very important. Temperature. Jason, what's the weather? Um, it is currently. It's only 72 degrees, which is Celsius 22.
Um, but my, uh, window is to the east. And so the sun comes in and it just cooks the room. So it's really hot in the morning, which, uh, we're recording this morning enough. Um, so yeah, uh, the fan is running.
It should be cut out, uh, in the show, but if you can hear it, I'm sorry, but also, no, I'm not sorry. It's hot. It's hot. It's hot. If you don't like it, turn the volume down and it'll go away.
That's all that means that, uh, I am in the process of cleaning my desk and reorganizing storage and whatnot. Um, and, and it's not going to be a connection in the future, but I am still working on it. Yep.
Um, well, we, we talked about this and I kind of waffled on it a little bit about like, oh, I don't know if I should or shouldn't set this as my connection. Um, I'm glad I did, but also like, I was correct in that I could not unsubscribe from the service until technically tomorrow.
Um, so as we're recording this, we're recording this on Tuesday. It'll come out on Thursday. So like, hey, by the time you're hearing this, I will have done the thing, but also like the fact that I spent the time and energy to go in and verify that was good because it saved me.
Well, technically it didn't save me the money because I had to pay the money because of the thing, but it's going to save me the money in the long run. Yeah. And it also allowed me to get some other things that needed to be taken care of, taken care of as well alongside of it. So that's awesome.
Um, but yeah, technically I didn't do it because I can't until tomorrow, but I kept up with it and there's something nice about being able to keep up with it and remember to do it in the future. So yeah, um, followed by our conductors who also did things. Yes, they did.
And first off, um, we will have an update about this in the like the ending thing, but I want to shout it out here too. Um, the magical bot in the relay discord, um, is listen, she's having a hard time. Um, and she needs to take a breather every so often.
Um, and so we have configured a way to collect connections. Otherwise, so if you go to my connection check dot com, by the time this comes out, hopefully it will be working. Oh, good. It's set up. Good. Excellent.
My connection check dot com will take you to the feedback form, which is where you can submit your connection. Just make sure to put your of the show. Um, in putting your pronouns in somewhere. Um, either way, like somewhere, one of those fields, please put your of the show.
So name, um, and if the bot doesn't work in, uh, discord, which you can tell if it doesn't have the little, um, like, uh, thumbs up thing, um, and the condo emoji, you know, that it hasn't worked. Um, but the, uh, go to my connection check dot com to fill out your feedback.
So we have a variety of, uh, inputs, uh, put here and, uh, it's going to be good. It's going to be good. We're excited to be here. I identify as host of the show. Um, sorry. It's, it's a mean, it's, it's a root show, but that's just fun. Um, yeah. You're so funny.
I mean, I do identify as a host of the show. But that's not your pronouns. Slash them. Okay. There we go. All right. So first off, our carl of all trades at the show carl says, uh, green check mark with a rocket made graphics and imported them into a sprite kit project.
It did not get around to adding physics or controls. That's okay. You still gave yourself a green check mark and we're super proud of you. Our shark of the show Chris said, and my connection was to get my office cleaned up, uh, orange circle.
I did get some of it cleaned up, but I think it's far from where I wanted to be. That's okay. Yeah. Okay. Um, our doll of the show Molly says, uh, orange heart or yellow heart, uh, mustard, mustard, uh, made good progress on my website, but still haven't got it to a deployable state. That's okay.
You are doing work and that's awesome. And we're super excited for you. Our fish bear of the show, Fishy Kai says green circle. We were as prepared for the summer as we could have been. I can't know. That works. That works. Um, our, uh, Esperanto, Nitor of the show, Irizano, oh gosh, I'm so sorry.
I had a cheat sheet in the. Irizania spreadsheet. Yes, that I overthink it. Irizania. So here's my problem with, um, words and things that I haven't practiced. I overthink it in my head, but one of these days it will just come flowing out.
And so I do apologize, but they said green check mark eight more chicken eight more chicken. Eight more chicken. Nope. Eight more chocolate. Knitted another pair of socks and followed up on a previous connection and bought a mobile air conditioner had a few hot days and used it.
It helped me get through the day somewhat normally. That is amazing. So excited for you. Eat more chicken in that net, never mind. They're controversial. Um, our profane sleeper, the show Mike says white circle was able to manage an hour a day of time to play games. Hooray. That's also that's fun.
That's so great. Uh, our soprano of the show, Debo says connection check green heart. And that blouse, hooray. So proud of you.
Our checklist enthusiast of the show Mike said green check mark keep working on cleaning up personal projects list took a sledgehammer to my project list and it's much more manageable now. Yes. Yes. You came in like a wrecking ball. Mm.
Did those tasks completed them all? Our identical twin of the show, Aaron says green circle had social stuff the first weekend at the fortnight, but had a nice long run this past weekend. Progress is being made. We love progress. Our robotics engineer of the show, Aiden says person graduating.
Um, I had a lovely time watching my girlfriend cross to stage at her convocation. Amazing. Our oracle of the show. So says green apple. My connection was to eat lunch regularly during conference season. And then I had to cancel going to my first conference, but I'm incredibly busy, busy anyway.
So eating regularly is helping me get through. Apparently regularly is another one of those words that I overthink in my head. That's that's me and the the W word of the big ball that we live on, um, because I can't say that word proper. Yeah. Oh, I, I, I, I say it like like a world.
Like to world, world around. Yeah. World, world, world. And our name was of the show nameless says, uh, green circle youth conference came in. Came no youth conference that, that happened and it was a massive success. I have said we're drunk there somewhere.
Uh, we had a total of 250 people way past what we were expecting. The team all managed. Um, and I didn't have to do more than I needed. I let my team to their work despite my want to get my hands and all the pies also round one of interview pass. And I got round two scheduled nervous.
Still can't believe I'm able to be in these rooms. Um, what do you mean by these rooms? No, no, we're super excited about these rooms that you're going to be in and how, um, super awesome. That is.
And if you want to know more, you should be a super conductor because you get, you get access to secret information about people's lives and everything that happens happens there and stays in there. Yes. Doesn't leave.
So I can't tell you about the super awesome things that are happening, but they're awesome. You should be excited. Very cool. Very cool. Very cool. Uh, this episode of condo it is brought to you by P, my favorite app that I use, which is a different kind of water app.
Feel better every day by adopting one simple habit. Most hydration apps ask you to tediously track your intake. Yeah, that sucks. Um, P takes a simpler and smarter approach. Just tap the button when you pee. That's it. You'll get reminders to drink water when you need it most.
And this one small habit will help you get more in tune with your body. It sounds weird and it works, but it works and users love it. The Apple Watch app is a favorite log in seconds on the way to the restroom and keep an eye on hydration right in front of your face. You can even add friends.
I haven't done that part yet. Hey, Kathy, what would I tell you if my pee notification just went off right now? Yeah. I would say you should have done what I did and run to the, uh, to, to tap that button before we recorded the show.
This is a thing that did happen where like it was like, Hey, I got to go use the pee app real quick. Yeah. And I was like, what? Okay. Um, anyway, yes. It feels great to get that nudge from a loved one when you're sacking on your slurping.
P is, uh, oh, yeah, you can add friends privately through iCloud so you can ping each other to hydrate. I haven't done that part yet. That still feels kind of weird.
But pee is crafted by a solo indie developer who I have talked to, um, who cares about thoughtful design, privacy and helping people stay hydrated. I can confirm all of those things. It's a free download.
So try it today and see how great you feel after just one week stick with it and you'll find that it's more than just hydration. It's a whole experience packed with thoughtful features and surprises. Search for pee water app in the app store.
So do the, do the premium stuff because the premium stuff is, is good. But Kathy, tell us about your experience using the pee app. Yeah.
So when I was setting up the, uh, episode two weeks ago, I was like, Oh, yeah, I had downloaded, but I hadn't really set up, um, and never really used it last time. Uh, peace sponsored us. And that's my bad. Uh, I have been using it for the last two weeks and it's been pretty great.
Um, not just, so part, part of it, I think is, um, the stand up and walk reminders or whatever that you get for the stand reminders on your watch app.
Um, I will just kind of like, yeah, totally like either I will ignore it or I'll do the cheat where you just put your hand down, um, to, to make it work or, or whatever. But when the pee app goes off, I'm like, okay, yeah, I do have to go to the bathroom.
Um, and, and we'll go and that gets me up and walking around, especially since my arthritis has been really bad in my like feet and ankles lately. So it's been hard to convince myself to walk.
Um, but by doing this and also, and here's a little bit of possibly TMI, I use, uh, pantyliners often because of really fun body things. Um, and this is helping me cycle through and make sure that I am replacing it often, which is also a good reminder. So, uh, that's, that's my experience.
That's fun. I love this app. I love the watch app. I've moved, like I changed, I, I swapped out the, um, weather widget, uh, or, sorry, the weather complication on my watch for this. That's how important it is. I, I have questions because I feel like something isn't right.
Either this app has been around for much longer than I thought. Um, but there's a leaderboard. I am, I am ranked 1,455, um, for my 127 day piece streak. Um, and I will just say I have logged over 500 piece since using this app. So like, that's wild. Um, oh, hey, there's a Siri option. Yeah.
Yeah, I haven't, I haven't like checked out the settings a whole lot. Um, I am, uh, 1,643. Uh, in my list, um, for 12 days. Oh, that's also, um, as I'm, as I have the app open, you can also authorize Apple health access.
And have it, it doesn't, I don't think it logs your like, peas and Apple health, but what it will do is when you wash your hands, it will say, hey, did you pee? Oh, that's fine. And you just go, yeah, I did.
Um, and it'll show you any hand washing event in the last 48 hours to which you can then go, yeah, I did. That was, uh, that was a pee moment.
Um, so that is again, this is an app that people who, like a person who really cares about keeping you hydrated, but also about like giving you features and apparently burying them in the settings. I'm going to give you the glaring look. You can't see it.
Um, but also app developer reach out to me again. I would love to sit down and actually like talk with you about this because like, this is, yes, I love this app. Yes. Um, me too, me too. I think I, I fairly, Kathy is on board to now. You have, you have pee super fans.
Um, and here's a fun promo for Condo illicitners. Once you've downloaded P, send the developer a message through the app. If you're one of the first 10, you will get a free year of pee premium. You can super pee. You will be, yeah. Plus it's fun. I like, I, you're not only a super conductor.
You're a super urinator and like, you get all of the elevated hydration habits. When you go with pee, so pee elevate your hydration habits today. Our thanks to pee for their support of this show and all of relay. Oh, that's so, I'm so glad they're back. I know, me too. Wow. So good. So good.
Again, just amazing apps app developers. If you have an amazing app and you want a community led by people who like genuinely love fun and whimsy, uh, talk to us. Now that I've said that, let's talk about this big downer of apps. So, okay, I think it's important though.
I think it's really, yeah, it's, it's okay. Here we go. So we, it's important to take care of yourself. We're going to put that out there right now because self-care is something that we talk about a lot. Um, and one of the other things we're discussing is checking out.
And when it's okay to check out, um, especially right now, there's a lot going on. In so many, so many ways. It's, it's difficult to not get exhausted. And one of one of the easiest ways to kind of protect that, like existence is to check out.
And obviously this goes along with, um, uh, last conduits, uh, topic of privilege. The more privileged you have, the easier it is to check out and the easier it is to successfully check out in a way that truly, fully, like, checks out, I guess.
Um, let's, let's clearly talk about what we're saying when we're saying checking out. Because I think that like, there is like, Hey, I'm burned out and I don't want to like, do a thing anymore. Check out. Then there's also just like, life is overwhelming.
And there are things that people feel like I should have the utmost opinions on. And maybe you do, maybe you don't.
And you were just checking out of the responsibility of echoing a certain belief or echoing or existing in a space where these things that are causing you frustration and like, just discomfort in life.
And you are making the choice to not make that a part of the things that you deal with day to day. Yeah.
And I really mean that second part when I, when I think about checking out, um, obviously being burnt out in like, finding time for yourself to heal and recover from that burnout, um, that can involve checking out in some ways.
But I think that that is, that is aligned with this topic in a way, but not necessarily like what we're specifically talking towards. Yeah. Or at least I'm not talking towards baby Kathy as I don't know. I don't speak for Kathy. Thank you. Thank you for that.
Yeah, I think it's hard because coming at this. So I think, okay, when, when the panera started in 2020, I was having uh, some PTSD vibes, um, very similar to when my spouse had their stroke. Um, this concern like this, the, the base level of worry about health was constantly there.
And this was something that was affecting not just my family though. Um, and this feels very similar to that in that sense of the base level of concern, anxiety and worry is kind of always present.
Um, for such a wide range of reasons, which means that it can't, like it constantly will cycle over what issue problem concern is happening. Like right now it's, I mean, everything.
But you know, um, our, our, our president choosing to, uh, bomb Iran and then apparently someone in this party nominated him for the peace prize for Nobel Peace Prize. Um, um, after apparently discussing a ceasefire, even though I don't, the hypocrisy, man, it's exhausting.
And, and I have, the, the, it's, it's so difficult. I'm not, I don't want to do like a both side is um thing, but there's so many things going on right now with so many individuals involved, um, that it becomes such a complicated discussion.
And when Minisoub asked me about the bombing and what happened and why it was really difficult to sit there and, and try to explain something that I don't even really understand either. Um, because it doesn't make sense in a logical, like, heart-centric life, I guess.
And, and you know, it comes down to you too. Like the Israel, Gaza, stuff is so much more complex than you can even begin to describe.
And I have friends in Israel and friends that are Palestinian and it's, it's all complicated because as soon as you put like two people together, you're going to have complexities. And then you put centuries of discourse together.
It's going to be even more difficult to try and explain, especially to somebody that is so caring and heart-centric that like bombing it all doesn't make sense.
Um, and, and so that's kind of right now, but, uh, on Flag Day, we celebrated by attending the protest in, in, or the event for no Kings Day in downtown Portland, um, which was an incredible experience of just like joy and support. Um, there were thousands of people there.
We ended up, we did leave before the march actually started, um, for a variety of reasons, but it was all happy and the, the love that I felt there was just incredible. And I'm so happy that I was able to take my kid there to experience it too. Everyone was safe. It was totally fine.
Even in the march, there were no issues. If you see something about Portland, having concerns that was for the ice, um, protest, uh, at the ice, uh, building, um, that apparently has shut down and they're like leaving Portland, uh, allegedly.
I haven't dived into actual like research to find out if that's true. Uh, so much is just like word of mouth, um, but, uh, like stuff is happening right now.
Um, and if you are getting overwhelmed, it's okay to take a step back as long as you're acknowledging that privilege and the ability to take a step back.
And as, you know, a white woman, I'm aware of that privilege and the ability that, you know, my, as a cis white woman, the privilege of being able to, you know, step back for a little bit is a privilege that I acknowledge. But like this weekend, I was so exhausted just by everything.
I only, like, we had multiple graduation parties and there's some that I didn't go to and some that I stayed very short because just the multiple people was overwhelming to me and they extremely draining. And I was like, you know what? I need to check out.
Like I could tell my body was telling me, hey, this isn't healthy for you. And uh, yeah, yeah, it's, uh, I'm really lucky, that I'm able to do that. And I'm, uh, then also, you know, moving on and, and like, okay, now I'm ready to get back into it and, and keep my information.
And I'm always looking for new places to, like, people that do the hard work of gathering links and articles and stuff. The discord is a good place for that.
I also have a couple Instagram people I follow that are really good at, like, sending stuff that's not necessarily, uh, US centric articles, uh, which is, is helpful to get, you know, because we, we all know the, um, biases that happens in a lot of places.
And so it's good to have a variety of information. I think that's, that's kind of the, uh, the first important piece of this is checking out for the sake of checking out is good. But there definitely should be a point in which I'm not saying you check in, but coming up for air.
Um, and this is, or diving down again, or diving, yeah, or diving down for peace. Uh, uh, yeah. But that, that does feel like, like one of those things that I've seen from time to time where folks will check out on a certain area. And then when they do, they're, they're checked out permanently.
Um, and I'm, again, I am okay with the idea of saying this is just not a thing that I can invest a lot of time and energy into. But when you, when you look at the. Some of the situation that we are in today, where there are a lot of people who vote against their best interests.
There are a lot of people who will choose to pair it whatever talking points that they've heard from a, from whoever, who is, whose motivations are not like I'm here to tell people what to think their motivations are purely I'm here to make money.
I'm here to grift off of people who genuinely believe in like whatever that person is saying, like don't get me wrong. I love the p app. My record shows this. But I'm telling you, I want the p app to sponsor because I like the p app, but I also like the money that the p app gives me.
Like there's, there's a very real like financial involvement in that. So I would hope that anyone listening to me tell you about how amazing the p app is that you can, you can process both sides of that.
 And it's not like I'm not saying that to be like both sides is I'm saying that like I can talk about here's why I love pco 8 because I've used pco 8 and also if pco 8 decided to give me a million dollars, I would really like pco 8 a lot more because I would be willing to invest more time and energy into it to be clear.
I used the p app because they paid me to use it and I grew to really, really like it. Right. So like there's a world there where like established trust can come from a space that's like I don't necessarily know if I should trust this person's opinion or not.
But until someone has had that very vocal conversation about like let's talk about like the underlying pinnings of this, I get paid to talk about this. I get paid to come onto this podcast and talk to y'all every other week. Yeah.
That means a lot of the things that I think about and do are influenced by that decision, but that doesn't mean that once that decision stops or comes to an end, that the relationship is completely eliminated. It like I like how larpa both and multiple things can be true at the same time. Yes.
However, when people decide that they're going to check out and they're checking out permanently, what happens is instead of saying I am going to be completely like ignorant towards the subject, what they then say is I am going to choose to echo the words of insert person here.
And this is where I think in a world of checking out, and again, I'm saying this because I have checked out on a lot of things in life. There are reasons why you should make sure that you don't stay, I would say ignorant to the situation.
 Checking out and being like actively engaged can be two different, are like two different aspects in many ways, where like I can check out to all the things that Kathy is going to tell me about photography, but if I want to be good friends with Kathy, I shouldn't check out of the fact that photography is a thing that Kathy is interested in.
I can go Kathy, I really haven't been able to keep up with all the stuff that's going on. And honestly, it's just I don't have the tire to process all the photography stuff that you have.
But if I hear about anything in the photography world, I'll let you know, and like feel free, I mean, I'm sure you'll probably have already heard about it, but I think I really appreciate when someone sends something that is just like, yeah, this made me think of you type of a thing.
It doesn't matter if I have heard it before or seen it before, I appreciate someone saying, hey, especially unicorn things, love when people sent me unicorn things. Like that makes me so happy that I'm being thought of.
Like if like Kathy's checked out on baseball, at least I think you're checked out on baseball very much so. Not whatever Savannah, bananas baseball is like what that actually is called. Banana ball. Well, is it just banana ball? Yeah, it's called banana ball. Okay, cool. Then yes, banana ball.
I'm here for it. I love it, especially where they have the little kid come and try and hit the ball and then get two strikes and then the banana comes and puts it on the teeth ball and they swing and then ever like everyone let's like they get a home run.
I will always watch every video of that every single time. Eight in S was I ever checked into baseball. Only moments when Jay listen, I'm very good at pretending I hear about things and that includes baseball when Jay is talking about baseball.
But I say that in if there was a super like big baseball thing happening in Kathy's area, I would probably still want to tell Kathy if not because Kathy loves baseball, but because hey, there's this thing called like the Olympics. I don't know if anyone's ever heard of those.
We wanted to make sure we had moved away from the Southern California area before the Olympics made their way there. And it had nothing to do with hating the Olympics.
Like honestly, I'm kind of I'm indifferent towards the I'm very much checked out of the Olympics other than track and field and gymnastics. But like I want to know I want to avoid that traffic with the passion.
So so like having having the base knowledge that allows me to navigate safely is important. And and this is this is like I think the the hard point that I have been struggling with. I I'm going to be personal in this. I have a friend who I talked to this morning who lives right outside of Tel Aviv.
I also have a friend whose family is from Gaza. They were born raised in the US, but their parents, you know, immigrated into the US right before they were born as a part of like having a better life for that. So imagine and these two people know each other.
Imagine the position that I have to be put in of the conversation around things happening. And it it isn't a matter of like do I believe that one person is right or wrong? I mean one I believe that like there are some people who are in charge who are very very very wrong.
But that doesn't stop me from having empathy for the people who are impacted by it. Yes. And I think that that is the message that I want to echo and convey more than anything. Regardless of what people people want to hate people right now.
And there are a lot of people that you can be upset with and be frustrated with because they made decisions. Those decisions had consequences. And those consequences have a like serious impact on how screwed up the world is right now. Yeah. But to be clear, like my child is six.
I don't want to teach her that she should just hate people because they're people unless they're Nazis and then it's okay to hate them. But I know people who voted differently from me. I know people who voted against their best interests. And what they did, they did for whatever reasons.
And in their heart of hearts, they genuinely believe that making that decision was going to be the best thing for them in that moment. And while I'm not happy with the decision that they made, I'm not going to tell my daughter that they should hate those people because of it.
And I'm not but I'm also not going to give them permission to come into like my house and like re-ig and night topics and conversations that I'm checked out on. Yeah. So like both of these spaces can be true. And I'm saying this because I want people to have a great Thanksgiving this year.
I want people to have amazing conversations with their co-workers. I want people to be able to live in a world where empathy is at the forefront. And like, malice and spite are like a thing that we can set aside and have a conversation that has nothing to do with those things.
And do that in a space where it's going to make people consistently happier and healthier in their day to day. Because stressing about what's happening on the opposite side of the world.
While you can have empathy for the people who are directly impacted by it, you don't have to necessarily wear the burden and the stress of that unless it does impact you. And it could. And it could in the future.
And again, this is where I'm saying like don't don't check out like a thousand percent. Don't be like if if someone brings up a you know, keyword, you're like la la la. I'm not listening.
But immediately look at the the aspect of does this affect me and my day to day? If the answer is for the most part and no, then like feel free to say hey, I'm checking out of this. I'm going to not participate in this.
And if people can go, well, you're so privileged because you don't have to deal with it. You don't have to live with it. You don't have to deal with the consequences of those actions. I get it. And to me, the response that I have to that because this is a conversation that I have on a regular.
Remember, I work with international nonprofit that deals with people across different religions, belief systems, geographics, wars, conflicts, like a lot of different things.
My response to them is look, I am okay with you feeling like you need to distance yourself from me because I'm making the decision to not let this be a thing that I put too much energy into. Yeah. But also know that that's not my wishes.
If you want to be a part of I like how you're as I'm going to just put this to protect my energy and my sanity, I'm going to remove myself from the situation.
But I hope that we can continue to have a space where we can exist together, where we can be friends, where we can talk, where we can communicate, where we can do these things.
Again, there are some things where like checking out does sometimes mean alienating people from your life at least temporarily. And I get that. But I love again, how ears on you'll put it. It is in the effort of protecting energy and sanity. It is an effort to protect that tire. Yes. Yes. Yep. Yep.
Yeah. And it's a really good point too is if this is a topic that does need to be discussed, you can also set boundaries of like, hey, this is when I'd like to do this. Or this is when it should just like today is not a good day.
I don't have the spoons for it today, but check it in with me tomorrow or picking a day a boundary after lunch, like after I've eaten something like this to to set that up, I think is also really important to to take into account. Yeah. I am actually the opposite of that.
Like I listen to BBC news every morning and I listen to NPR every morning. And the best part of it is like it's like an hour long cycle. I'm half checked into it. I'm half tuned in. And then when they get to certain topics, I switch to the other channel.
So like, they're talking about this again, time to see what BBC is talking about. And again, like, I will definitely say, do what you feel is going to keep you energized and healthy and happy and safe. What you check out on not everyone else around you has to check out.
But also what everyone else is hyper engaged in, you don't have to be that's entirely up to you. Yeah. Unless it's the P app and you should totally check into that at least every time the notification goes out. Yep.
Or even when it's not going out, the average wouldn't take it, wouldn't take your sleeping time frame into the overall like the average time to split the bed. Kathy were all adults. No, thank you. I'm going to deal with that. I'm sorry. More than zero. I'm sorry. So yeah.
Oh, getting getting older sucks. And I will say like, there's a lot of times where I am pushing the button during hours that no one should be pushing the button. And I'm just like, I hate this. But such as life. Yeah. Yeah.
Speaking of life, Kathy, what are we checking ourselves into in the form of connections? Oh goodness. I need to come up with some ideas for healthier ways to check out.
Just sitting on the couch, scrolling TikTok is not a very, and I'm not talking about being productive while resting because that's bad. But being able to not to remove myself from the black hole of doom scrolling. So figuring out some options for healthy disassociation.
My favorite kind of disassociation. I used to play bass for the band disassociation. Nice. No, that's awesome. I don't know what I'm going to do. I am likely going to, I'm going to finish this blog post. I'm working on a blog post. It's for work.
At some point, I need to have it done so I can send it to people and so that they can basically go, yeah, looks good and then just ship it. But more than anything, I don't want, I don't want the opposite to happen. I don't want it to be like, they're done waiting on me.
And then I'm like, oh, let me just finish this thing real quick. No, no, no, no, that's not how this is going to work. So they can, I'm going to finish this thing. Kathy, are you in the chat talking about your, your retreat thing? Yeah. Y'all have again, y'all have fun. Uh-huh. And just suck.
Love you. Love y'all and you suck. Yeah. The two things can both be true. Nice. Make sure to write your connection in the notes so I don't have to ask you again on Thursday while you're thinking about it. How about I start reading the next connections? Please do.
Our, our, our carl of all trades of the show Carl says next connection. As much as I would love to work on learning more sprite kick kit, I need to apply for jobs.
The internet and sound system died at the church and the pastor, my wife has asked me to fix this and I have a paying gig residing, reciting a friends garage. So by next connection, I will put out at least three job applications and make a start on the rest of that.
Our shark of the show, Chris says my next connection is to get the garbage cleaned out of my garage. I just did a segment of this and oh my goodness. Yes. So great. So great to be able to see your walls. So nice. Yes.
Uh, our doll of the show, Molly says next week, organize my music library, quit Spotify last year and have listened to less music as a result. Like, yes, I hope that helps. Our fish bear, the show fishy guy says we've got a trip coming up. It's time to make some lists.
Hey, you should get with the checklist enthusiasts of the show. I heard they like checking lists. Our Esperanto nitter of the show, Irizano says new connection. Unfortunately, right after buying the AC found out that my mortgage payments will increase quite a bit starting next year.
For my next connection, I'm diving into my budget and going to cut costs and adjust spending. Have six months to figure it out. Good luck. Good luck. And our pathologist of the show Laura. Hello, Laura says new connection. Take advantage of the time off. My son is off ising his dad to relax. Wait.
I was trying to read this correctly because Laura is in the chat and I don't want to get in trouble. Take advantage of the time my son is off visiting his dad to relax. There we go. That makes more sense, including I don't know hanging out with a unicorn of the show or something.
Also, start getting used to having a more unpredictable but lighter schedule at work. Oh, I hope that everything is okay and I hope that you have a lot of fun. And also, yeah, we're just going to remember live secret show of conduit. No one tell Kathy.
Our profane sleeper of the show, Mike says new connection. Work more. But you know what? Yeah. Yeah. That works. Love it. Short sweet love it. So, Brandon of the show, Debo said, turn those we should get together for dinner conversations into actual dinner plans with dates on the calendar. Yes.
And may I suggest this is a trick that I use with a couple of my reoccurring friends is make another date before you leave this date. You can make adjustments. You can change and remove it. But having it on the schedule means that you're more likely to do it in the future.
So, I highly recommend that. Other tip, pick out all the things first as suggestions and like shift the conversation from we should get together for dinner for, hey, here's this place that I'm wanting to try. I was thinking about going there here.
Do you want to come with me? And then it becomes, it becomes more of a like, okay, if I can't do it then then I can do it this other way. Like it already starts with them having already agreed to get dinner with you.
And it takes some of the decision making out of the, out of the way because oh, that's us. Every time we have to make a decision, just something just doesn't get done. Yeah, yeah.
We always have some classic fallbacks if we don't want to try something new for both my sushi dates and my brunchy babes that are like if we can't think of something, we just go to our default. But if we do want to try something new, we try something new. And I highly recommend that.
I think that's great. Yep. Our checklist enthusiast of the show Mike says actually finished cleaning up reorganizing my office. I've been slowly working on it and now it's time to get it over the finish line. You can do it Mike. I'm writing down the notes. There we go.
Okay, our identical twin of the show, Aaron says start thinking of time off plans for the summer. I hope it starts with rest. Yes. A robotics engineer of the show, Aiden says I'm finally officially moving in with my girlfriend this weekend, which means I need to finish packing up my stuff. Yes.
Good luck. You can do it. Our Oracle of the show says there's so much work right now. It's a bit intense. I'm just going to keep eating lunch five times a week and using my exercise bike four times a week to stay grounded or no, stay grounded, folks. Yes. Our Oracle nope. Just kidding.
You just read that. The nameless of the show nameless says prepare for round two interview. Also get back into journaling. I got a new pen as a gift from Mrs. nameless for my graduation. I want to excuse to use it finally send the second half of the year curriculum curriculum to my team. Yes.

And thank you to P the greatest hydration app in the world for sponsoring this week's episode. I feel bad because the like waterminder or some other like hydration app is going to ask us to sponsor one day. And we're just going to be like, all right, look.
