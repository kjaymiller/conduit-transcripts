From really FM, you're listening to Conduit, the show where we conduo our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that talks about the future in the present. This episode is brought to you by Micro.Blog, Computex Taitra and Ecam.
I am Kathy and with me today is the one and only Grumpy Oldman, Jay Miller. Hi Jay. I think that intro went past me. Um, so this week in the discord was busy, of course, because WWDC was yesterday. So our hashtag Apple channel was bananas.
But we've also got a bunch of excitement for the live show happening in the end of July because it's a little over a month and a half away now, which is absolutely terrifying and super exciting. I'm excited to get on another international flight, but not on the airline that I flew to Taiwan.
So make sure if you are not a superconductor, I talk all about my flights to and from Taiwan in the pre show. So check that out if you're interested. We'll have some more information a little bit later on, but hey Jay, what happened in the co-working? Oh man.
I just wanted to throw out there like, it's your choice. You could either give us like $12 a month or you could take an expensive flight to Taiwan to see what Kathy was talking about. One of these is significantly cheaper than the other. Also, we'll take $5 a month. It doesn't have to be $12.
It's $7 a month now, isn't it? $7. Yep. $7 a month. Yep. Yep. Not 12. Either way, not 12. Not 12. I mean, you can get, you want to give us an extra five on the side. Also sure. I'm not going to refuse your money. Anyway, in the co-working, I tried to get the music working. It did not work.
We usually have nice relaxing music and instead we had Jay going crap, didn't work. We talked about a lot of stuff. We talked about work stuff. Honestly, we did a lot of work. I was. That for us. Yeah, I know. That's so weird.
I was working on a project for helping people do transcriptions with AI, which was just funnier than anything productive at the time. AI be while and y'all. I love this for us. I love this era. We're about to go into. He said shaking his head vigorously.
But yeah, it was super fun to catch up with everyone and everyone was kind of heads down working on their own little things. We learned more about, we learned more about the career path of a UX and UI developer in very good detail.
Work on those portfolios, y'all make up use cases and then test them or make up test cases and test them and use them perfect. Yeah, it was honestly, it was a really good conversation. I was super excited to have it because it talked about an area of tech that I don't get a lot of exposure to.
And if you want to enjoy things like that, you can do so by joining our next co-working session in the off weeks with. Yeah, you can also join us live while we record each episode in the discord. Any of those things are part of the membership plan. You can visit I am a superconductor.
com to become a member today. That's letter I letter M letter A superconductor.com. All right. So a couple of shout outs here and follow up, I guess. Um, now, uh, our identical twin of the show, Aaron says, Jay was in Toronto and didn't say hi. Just kidding. Hope you had a nice time.
Now you were in Toronto. Is that how that happened? And I think you hung out with some people. Yeah, I was going to say I specifically asked people in the discord. If you were in Toronto, or sorry, Toronto, as I call it, there's only one T in Toronto.
Um, that you let me know and that we, I mean, not only did I hang out with, with some of our other super awesome superconductors, uh, we went to a baseball game. We got dinner. I paid for everything like it was a blast and yes, shut up in there.
But that being said, I'll be there again next month on the 10th and the 11th. So wait, yes, on the 10th and the 11th. Uh, so if you want to hang out, there's a chance. But also this might be the last time I go to Toronto for work.
So, uh, they were like, wait a minute, how much money did you spend? And I was like, uh, let's not talk about that. And then they're like, hmm, we have 40 people that work in Toronto. Maybe you don't have to fly from it.
Which I've been saying that this old time, right? But you got to go, which is nice. Our Oracle of the show.
So says that, um, yes, they are indeed applying for dual citizenship because they've been entitled and the reason why is because of Brexit mainly, um, because it gets more complicated and, uh, so basically just as expected, there is a reason that they are doing it.
And, uh, it's not something the silly Americans would understand. Yep. And I would also just say that I, oh, yeah, Brexit. I watched a video that talked about potential countries that might become their own, like, my become nations, um, and to see Scotland show up on that.
I was like, oh, yeah, that's right. That whole thing's complicated. Ain't it? Sorry. Complicated in it. So there was, there's that whole thing.
Um, having flown into Europe recently and seeing like the cues for stuff and like now they're being carveouts for like, if you're American, you can go here. If you're Chinese, you can go here. If you're British, you can go here.
If you're everyone else on the planet, I guess this other, this other cue. And I'm like, ooh, that, that feels rough. Oh, yeah, also if you're, if you're, you're opinion union, then like there is no line. You just go because it must be nice. Um, I'm so jealous. I wish, I wish we had that.
I just wish every country accepted my global entry and allowed me to just walk straight through. Right. Yeah. Oh my, oh my gosh. Okay. So real quick distraction there while you mentioned to global entry. Let me just tell you about how ridiculous it is to be an international layover in Seattle.
So I landed from Taiwan and then you get off the plane and you pick up your, by your baggage and then you have to go through customs. Super easy for global entry. Just take the picture, whatever move on.
But then we had to go through security again, which I, because I have global entry, that also includes TSA precheck, which means I pack for TSA precheck. Um, but no, the security didn't care that I had TSA precheck. So I had to take all of my electronics. I had to take my shoes off.
I had to like pull my liquids out, but they didn't tell me to pull my liquids out. And so it got pulled to the side. And I'm just like, why is this a thing? Why can I not have TSA precheck in this tiny little like fake security thing? It was so frustrating. I was already exhausted, of course.
And I had had to fight to get to my luggage because everyone sat around with their frickin luggage cards at the carousel for the, it was, it's frustrating, but moving on. How about some connection checks? Oh, that's okay. Wow.
How did you do, Jay? My connection was the live stream twice in the last span. Kathy, I streamed. Thrice. Whoa. Yeah. I think it was Thrice. I'm checking, I'm checking my, my YouTube channel. Pretty sure I straight up. Thank you to the 12 subscribers in the last month. Y'all are fantastic.
But yeah, I, I live streamed setting up my desk, which Kathy, I have a question to ask you about that later because you were missing parts to your uplift desk. I was missing screws. I wasn't missing parts. They just didn't work. Oh, it wasn't level. I was just missing straight up screws like nice.
Yeah. So luckily, I just, I was like, yeah, you can never have enough screws around. So about those. So yeah, so oh, I streamed four times then because I streamed doing the desk build, which was really fun. And thank you to everyone that hung out with me.
I think Pillix was in the chat for that one. And then I streamed three times on the project that I was working on. And each of my streams were except for one was over two hours. Wow. I was like, yeah, I can't, I can't set that expectation for the future.
But I do plan on doing more streaming things. Amazing. So I gave myself an orange circle. My connection was to journal daily, even in Taiwan. And I did not. I did fairly well. I did. I would say I think for days a week, I even got this really great little notebook.
It's very small and for daily journaling. And it has space for the day at the top. But the best part is because it's small. It means I don't feel obligated to write too much. So and then because it's undated is a, like it's a way to kind of, I'm not going to like waste any pages.
And yeah, Laura says daily is a hard ask and you're right. I am silly for saying daily as my connection because that is not what I should have done. But it's okay because that's what I did. And you know, we're working, we're working through it.
How did our connectors do? Well, I am glad you asked as I go back to our sheet. Our artists of the show, Carly said, connection check red box. Not the place for you to do video things. I, I, I, I, it's facing completely forgot about my connection.
That's okay because I did too, but I, I did it and I was like, oh, I forgot what it was. But these things they happen. I understand. Our pathologist of the show, Laura says connection check green heart.
I think my connection was to catch up on work stuff and make time to work on some longer term projects.
I'd say I did pretty well at this and dug my way out from under case mountain cases that had piled up for me to look at and got a lot of lecture work done as well as some slide reviews and validations. Excellent job, Laura. So proud.
And then our robotics engineer of the show, Aiden says, yellow heart. I think I have the plan for my portfolio sorted out, but I haven't finished it yet. That's okay. Progress, progress is great. Our soprano of the show Devon says connection check yellow heart.
I didn't cut out any pieces for the quilt as I had hoped, but I decided on all the fabrics and ordered the last few supplies I needed. And then our tech podcast listener of the show, Pillik says green square or not green square. I'm colorblind yellow square didn't get time to learn so few.
I'm not colorblind. I just can't look at pictures correctly. But had a great time listening to dub dub on Monday. I have kept applying for jobs had an interview, but they didn't take me because of a lack of experience.
Yeah, I know that struggle did keep thinking about the granddad project might change what I'm doing for the front end. Yeah, I'm excited to see how that progresses.
Our fish bear of the show, fishy guy says green tree green because get the kids prepared for and send them to summer programs is totally a home improvement project, right? Absolutely. It's improving the home life and way that you live. Our mountain dweller wait, did I skip like five? Wow.
I was really excited to read. Okay. I'm sorry. Work started. But working. And I was like, yeah, go, go away. Go away. Do that. Oh, geez. Sorry about that fishy guy. Oracle of the show. So said red apple. I did not find my passport stuff. I've got loads of other things done. Just not that.
I'm trying again next one with hey, I'm trying to get a new project. I'm trying to get a new project. Sometimes you had a hard stop. What do you do? Stop and then go. Our tire advocate of the show. Chinta says connection check green circle sewing project is done.
I'm pleased with how it came out and it's ready in plenty of time for the end of July. I was so excited to see this. So excited. Our checklist enthusiasts of the show. Mike says red X. Talk, talk. Thank you for your attention in the picture for the new project didn't get a chance.
To set up the website. But did do some other ground work. Do just mother ground work. Sounds like a yellow to me. I mean, I wanted to sign up got Layla Sarge thing. I wrote. So I'm at doing this. I know I counted it. And I was like, yeah.
The identical twin of the show who apparently is mad at me for not going to Toronto or going to Toronto not saying hi Hi Aaron says green circle.
I still have some technical debt that's in flight But got all the major changes we needed done said debt is also pending as my contract there Has my contact there who reviews my changes is on vacation?
 Gotcha Gotcha gotcha or nameless of the show nameless says connection check yellow circle I ordered the garden wire, but it was all it was too hot all conduit to actually install it I am going to do it this conduit as there are cloudy days coming hooray for cloudy weather then our Code monkey this show Douglas says connection check green Check despite some insane work stuff going on.

 We've had a lot of of things happening just around us recently And to be honest it feels like things are either slowing down or speeding up Maybe they're slowing down for one and speeding up for the other but I'm excited To hear from my friend Kathy who has been Moving at the speed of light recently About What's coming up in the future Kathy Kathy are you slowing down anytime soon Okay, so this is the hard part right now because I am kind of in a Attrending water phase With the potential of things speeding up extremely fast At some point possibly in the future Which is really difficult because it's it it's hard to To plan for that Um I I'm pre-exhausted shall we say but there there's things that are it's all potential Happenings um it may or may not happen and that's the part that's like really Uh Not scary but makes it really difficult kind of plan Uh Not counting the facts that You know, Ellie for London in 30 hold on let me look at my my count down Uh 36 days nope that's my other flight because oh by the way I am Visiting I have a for my nonprofit convention I leave the weekend before I head to London and I come back Two days before um so 42 days To leave for London um which is is very soon Um and I'm already tired, but you know what it's gonna be great.
 It's gonna be great Gonna be great gonna be great so One of the things that we we wanted to try and Figure out on this is How do we How do we stabilize for the future and I think that That is Been the challenge of you know, we we look at some of these things a lot of it is in the realm of if I'm trying to get things Together I have to consider what's happening now What I'm supposed to be doing so like what I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing and then what's coming up and Kathy you're the only person I know that lives a life more complicated than mine so It feels like Are you able to handle The what you're supposed to be doing and what you're actually doing like is that is that coming into more of a A one-to-one yeah, it's it's difficult because this is a moment of slow time I say as I just got back from type-A a couple days ago Um, but the month of June is Dance hasn't started yet So I don't have a ton of like I have more availability in my evenings, which is rare um So I have Those kind of pauses Those moments to kind of breathe, shall we say um But I am also trying to utilize them the best to get this foundation in place For when things start ramping up again uh I am Planning on reads like Doing my bedroom.
I need to get rid of a bunch of stuff get rid of a bunch of clothes.
 I need to rearrange it so that um Mr soup can access Close Easier instead of me having to grab them um It's something that's been on my list to do forever and I just haven't ever done it um But it will make things easier in the long run as well as giving me kind of Give me back that Here is my sanctuary at home by having a cleaner Um more organized bedroom Um, which is a goal to allow me to kind of find those moments to rest um And yeah, it's It's rough because again like I said i'm in this kind of treading water standpoint In part of my life but also It's super busy because you know we we're starting pacacathon planning I've got my first meeting in a couple weeks for that we're going through and you know the July trip all of all of these things are happening Still happening and yet my brain is like oh You've got nothing going on because it's slower than it normally is and this is kind of the trauma talking because I'm so used to being so busy All the time that when I am not busy I have a harder time Actually acknowledging the rest so Yeah, it's a lot of It's a lot I'm glad that she brought that up um the the idea of not Like said not setting the standard of I have to always be busy like this I think um again, I keep I keep talking about Our conductors because our conductors are some of the brightest people in the world Um so smart they really are I want to say it was Laura that was talking about this of like I went to take a vacation and it took me like There is there's like the vacation and then the vacation from the vacation There's there's the I have to trick my brain into being in the space of doing nothing in this moment is okay or not doing as much as You were doing before is okay and I think that that's That is a Scary sentiment especially like I don't know like I mean Kathy you're your own boss Which I don't know how that plays into the like You get you don't get laid off you get fired like you get you get we've decided we're no longer Like working together on this project which is probably More stressful than then like a layoff comes with the severance in some cases or You know insurance Things and and stuff Um yours is kind of abrupt so I can imagine how the I mean although It's there's something to be said of the fact that you can kind of know when Of stuff is going to happen Like you know if a situation isn't working out Um my my unfortunate brain always thinks it's always happening even for like Relay and I've been working with them for how long now but it's like it's always like oh my gosh I've totally messed up.
I'm a terrible person.
 I'm getting fired type of a thing You know, I know that's not happening But you know brains are brains are dumb yeah And I think that's that's fair because I'm The same way when it comes to things like this show like There is a There's like a world where a few things can happen and and one of these things has happened Previously in the podcasting space which is like Our advertisers could be like we're not happy with the results that we're getting from the show Which I would say by the way our advertisers say the exact opposite So keep doing what you're doing click the links Love us we very appreciate like we we are We are pulling sponsors that normally would go for shows two or three times our size so Keep doing the good work out there Um The other side of that is you know they could just say uh it's We're the industry as a whole is not getting into sponsorships anymore Um and then all of a sudden now the show gets deprioritized We lose our sponsors and then I'm not saying that it prevents us from doing The show it makes the show a lot harder especially when like I don't I haven't talked to Kathy about this but we replaced our floors And now our refrigerator is leaking on the new floors again So yeah, yeah, yes, so we have a new refrigerator coming this weekend Um That we had to pay for because our home warranty decided that they were not going to pay for it so Ah again, are they gonna fix your floors again?
 No, the luckily the floors because the problem with the old floors was that it was leaking for a year and no one noticed So it was like a year worth of damage this time around we got we didn't even get real hardwood because I was like I'm not falling for that again Um, I've got a kid We'll get real hardwood when there's no pets or children to mess things up.
I can walk around the house and socks Um, so we got LPV or the luxury The vinyl stuff that looks like floors like fake fake hardwood floors Um, and those are waterproof so Nice.
 That's fine This is more of just like uh, hey I don't want there to be water laying on the kitchen floor for any amount of time let alone Yeah, you know For a time we don't expect it to be there Um, so Having to do that on top of that when they did the the manufacturers warranty is Uh, oh no, it's not the new fridge.
This is still the old fridge. We were getting a new fridge because the Old fridge which we thought was fixed finally Is not fixed finally So we're just done we're done with it.
We've spent Enough money to buy half of our refrigerators and now we're just gonna buy the old fridge Um But when they were repairing our countertops they also were when they were repairing the That area that our stove was sitting in they broke the countertop.
So now we have to get new countertops Luckily they're paying for all of that.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's all that's all through the insurance stuff Like we didn't have to do anything on that but that means that's just gonna be more time And they're like well if you're doing this if you're going to because we've been talking about replacing our stove Or like do it now replace the stove now because we're gonna have to cut the countertop so Yeah, you want it to fit exactly.
 So let's get the stove that you want So that we can cut it for whatever the new stove is and then also they'll do the installation and all that stuff for us as well and that that's all covered um But in all of that it's like I can't get back to feeling like I'm in my space Because every five seconds Something is broken or something needs to be replaced or something needs to be swapped out or someone needs to come in and spend three days And then I don't have a stove so that I'm cooking food on a hot plate like I fully get that but on top of that I still have meetings I still have people asking me for things.
I have a non-profit. I have conferences. I have all these things and What it came down to for me eventually was telling my boss.
 I need my productivity to be lower for the next month Like Ultimately you have two choices either my productivity can be low Or my productivity can be zero because I'm gonna have a breakdown and quit Like oh my god, which is not helpful exactly Um, so I can I can definitely I can definitely see where like you having to recalibrate To go like hey What I'm doing right now is doing enough Yeah, that it's so It's difficult to remind yourself that hey, this is Okay to have a weird time of day to a weird period of your life um It's okay to take moments and be stressed and realize that um Yeah This is not ideal But it's okay to have a not ideal situation going on um It it's difficult And rough but you know, it's it's how It life is You know, it's it's floating around all the time I feel like the the way of saying is it's okay to be not ideal when things aren't ideal Yeah Yeah And and acknowledging that and and living with it sucks, but can be helpful.
Yeah Well, and I mean there is there's a world where Life is Perfect and happy and everybody's great and nobody's miserable.
 It's not this planet It's not this world This world will never be that often our own comfort comes at the discomfort of someone else Um again, we got we got the jobs and roles that we got Over someone else and hopefully they got the job that they got Over someone else who hopefully got the job that they got over someone I was a light there's always going to be A little bit of unfairness We see it a lot in our connections of people who again amazingly talented extremely bright people who are Doing so many fantastic things and I'm so excited for them in their careers And all their space But I'm seeing people who are equally as talented equally as bright also struggling to To do the thing and The world around us doesn't take that into account In our interactions with them Like Kathy Kathy loves picking on me because I'm Solus, but I do I didn't say at this time wasn't me um I try my best to Not go full dolly part and talk about like there's a little bit of good in everybody I think there's some people who are just not good um I think they got to that point through a lot of bad things happening um, but I do try to See the world with empathy-tented glasses And go like what did it take for that person to get to this situation Maybe not where they are in life, but maybe how they're reacting in a certain To a certain situation like what Why is that person yelling at me when there's literally nothing that I could do um You know why is this person giving me a gift on the plane when I really just want them to get out?
 The way so I can finish cleaning You know like any any of Any position that someone's in like even if I'm Not actively engaging them on it like just trying to think about like Hey, if I clean up my space around me to make that person's life a little bit easier that that my They're they're cleaning up a bunch of junk and then all of a sudden This one little piece is like oh well this at least this one person was nice Now pat all the other tricks out there um But you know all of this is all of this is in the and I'm not telling Kathy this as if she needs to to learn it or anything All of this is is to say The amount of empathy that I hope I can give other people I sure is heck like don't give it to myself Yes Yeah, that's something I know I have a harder time with that I'm actively working on is Talking to myself like I talk to my friends um Knowing that If I'm talking to one of our conductors and they're having a hard time they're having a hard day There any of these You know, they're feeling like they're not Worthy or worth it or any of this and this actually it fits perfect because I had I had a very very bad couple of days um a couple weeks ago Where I felt like the biggest failure in every part of my life like I felt like nobody was my friend Like really friend like I wasn't worth being friends with like it was just it was a bad bad brain be time of day And I had to reach out But I thankfully I was Smart enough strong enough to reach out and say hey, I could use some help and reassurance and oh like support In a way that I will absolutely drop anything for anyone else um and Know that it will be returned to me and I very thankfully Friends came in and and you know Hold it all together and and gave me so much love and support But yeah, it's it's breath when you hit this this brain situation where you're like oh my goodness what is even happening right now and You don't know how to deal with it and that's why friends Friends are are important and and being able to recognize and acknowledge when you need help um And and let people tell you the truth which is that you're an amazing person in your worthwhile And I'm so happy that you're here wow This episode is brought to you by Computex But it's one of the largest a iot that's artificial intelligence of things and startup shows It's been happening in Taipei from June 4th through 7th.
 Hey, that's already happened Well, we need to we need to change some of the tents uh in this Okay, and the read i will do my best So whether you're a seasoned industry professional or a passionate entrepreneur Computex had something for every had something for everyone I actually watched some videos from Computex too and I was like I wonder if I see Kathy in the background um Kathy you were a Computex how did that go?
I was I was it was absolutely incredible um the the key note um with AMD let me just tell you i am a huge fan girl of dr.
 Lisa Sue who is the CEO of AMD and did the opening like welcome keynote and she Lutely destroyed the leadership like rolling The ownership of this keynote um it was incredible to see a woman in charge and kind of Basically managing the the entire stage uh and It was really fun too to to you know, they're talking everyone was talking about AI and how it was working in a variety of their different Things different Listen to literally anyone else um for the actual details of like numbers and super fast and zoom zoom and all and all of that You know the tech stuff of things um i really appreciated how Honest and oh like self-aware every company that stood up on the stage and talked about specifically AI Talking about the ethical and environmental Bits of things making sure that they're aware most of the stuff is done On computer at his local and is not going to be you know run through random um servers to build Things i listen i'm not a tech journalist i don't know how this all works coming from A non tech journalist this was really a really incredible Experience to be able to ask the questions that i needed to ask that i wanted to ask and listen to the people talking about it And how fricking smart they are and that was just really great.
It was so it was so much fun so much fun Taiwan is a country with a robust AI ecosystem and Computex is a premier event to showcase AI empowerment This message has been validated by my first-hand experience. I like it Hopefully next year maybe it'll be my turn.
 We'll see But if it's anything like Computex 2024 there was cutting edge technology from AI computing advanced connectivity and future mobility um robots and stuff You can explore the latest trends and innovations that we're shaping the future of tech uh the networking industry leaders at Innevex You've missed your chance To skyrocket your startup with innevex Computex is international startup hub I like those types of events because you get people who are like The true there there are some folks who are like On my my Company is building the future generation of paper weights And then there are some people who are like this new generation Who are really trying to change how things are are happening and those are the types of folks that you can see I hope at innevex Where there is i'll i'll talk about this real quick.
 There was um an Innevex one of the Innevex companies that we talked to um is called tilt five And they do tabletop augmented reality and the Uh video the augmented reality glasses were really like super comfortable which if you've done any sort of augmented reality This is a big deal It wasn't super heavy The mat like the the table was just like a mat that you rolled out and then it interacted and worked Just like right there um it was I think it they said it was the number one kickstarter uh for ar um in history and it's really Really great especially for someone that needs to um like In a way to get the ar with uh people that don't know what ar is um They talked about when they were designing the controller to make it like a wee which was the number one Like game for like game controller for anybody to be able to use you pick it up and you kind of know How to do it and that was kind of their goal not to make it like super complex or like let's you know Make this the most innovative ever Instead it was like let's make this for everybody and I I just loved their passion about it And there were so many people that were so passionate about everything that they were talking about But even if it wasn't for me specifically it was really cool Yeah, yeah, and there are other passionate Thought leaders and keynote speech speeches from again AMD Intel Qualcomm media tech Super micro NXP and delta um As well as workshops that were led by industry experts like uh those are the things that Kathy says that I do that she'd never watches gaining valuable knowledge and insights So if you want to level up for next year next year it's already been announced they will be again in Taipei on May 20th 2025 so you can It would get ready for the next Computex happening next year in May by going to Computex Taipei.
com Dot TW slash conduit I don't think you could register yet, but at least have that bookmark so you can keep an eye out for the next um Incredible opportunity to be at the forefront of one of the world's largest AIT and startup shows Our thanks to Computex for sponsoring this show and all of relay FM Thanks so much for an incredible experience Okay So we kind of did our Topic and together instead of splitting it.
Oh no, I've got plenty of future. Oh, okay good Excellent tell me tell me it's your turn.
 I was confused because yeah Clearly this is a longer episode so hold on to your butts I know So yeah My I talked a little bit about some of just the added stressors that I have but the As I as I told my boss I am preparing for a productivity slowdown um, and this is gonna be required like I've spent the last month I've spent the last like year um, I was I was asked to give A keynote at PyCon US, which is like the Premier conference.
 It's the Computex of the Python community That's the the best way to put it like I mean we had People from Nvidia people from other you know amazing companies and stuff That are all using Python, which is the programming language that I use personally And I was asked to not only give a keynote at this event, but to be the opening keynote for this event To share some of my experiences as a nonprofit founder and you know around the community that I started with black python devs and When when I say that the amount of mental and emotional energy That that took Like I'm still recovering from that like I think that that's a thing that We we don't think about is the like I did a thing that was really really hard And there's a rush of of dopamine that happens when that's done But then there's like that other rush of I forgot what it's called But the stuff that just makes you feel completely drained and like Like almost lethargic um Normally I need time to recover from that however I left Pittsburgh where that event was happening feeling like a dang rock star because This thing happened where like I love telling people hi and like introducing myself and I'm gonna go hi I'm Jay it's nice to meet you and they go oh, I know who you are because you were the person on stage and like I had to tell people just pretend that you don't Because I needed that recharge to get me through the event Because I left Pittsburgh and went straight to Toronto To do an event where no one knew me And I was hosting the event so like I was the main person the main MC on stage and it was like All of the all of the energy Being poured out of me immediately going back and having to flip the switch run on reserves And like make it happen And then to come back and basically like hey welcome back You have a talk that you have to give in two weeks at an event that is going to be full of nothing but tech influencers And like normally the amount of time I would have to prepare is months So like hey, you know take your time you can do the other other work and stuff um Just know that like All of the energy all the time that you'd normally had had to go to this other important thing and now you don't have it also also um We've had to deal with people at work who have left the company and kind of the the aftershocks of that On top of hey Work still happens so there's still company things that are happening And Jay you've been putting a lot of time and energy into these other things we really need you to Come in and do these other tasks that are more aligned with what your regular job is and it's it's been You know we we're joking about the idea of stabilization and It's it's been like driving at 120 miles an hour for way too long and still feeling like there's a curve about to come that I just can't handle and like I am doing everything in my power to force a slowdown um to force the the slowing down of things again on top of all the floor stuff on top of the counter stuff like all that stuff happening and Uh, we talked about it a little bit in the systems check.
 I do have my second notebook uh Like on on above the first notebooks and now there's two notebooks on the desk um Again, I feel like there's a better solution than this but we'll we'll figure it out in time um but the The situation has has ultimately been me going to my boss and going I need two weeks To just work on a project uninterrupted And luckily my boss is like You know when I got hired out the thing I yeah, he was like what's gonna be the the thing that helps Me work with you best and I said you've just got to let me cook like I know what I need I know what I need to do my job, but I know what I need to do my job at the highest level I'm just gonna need you to sometimes I'm gonna ask for some buckwild stuff I just need you to let me cook like if you legitimately can't do it I understand like if you can let me cook it's gonna work out.
It's gonna happen. It's gonna be great It's gonna be fantastic. So When that would be amazing Yeah, so when I when I went to him I was like hey, I need two weeks to just work on This thing uninterrupted And he was like okay, and I was like yes, I know I've got like a talk coming up.
I have a talk in two days I'm So like I'm like, ah gotta figure that all that out, but I'm working on this project.
 I'm live streaming working on this project I'm doing all this stuff when I tell you that my entire team They they like saw what I was working on and they were just like whole Wow like Holy crap that was That's ridiculously awesome and I was like This is what happens when we cook like this is what happens when there's like time down to just do the thing and Out of it they were like well like okay, it's it's cool, but like what are we getting out of this?
 I was like oh, I'm glad you asked Here's a here's a list of blog posts and videos and workshops that I can do off of the content that's already been created So like now there are tasks on tasks on tasks That I've now given myself that allows me to Take what's been done take the work that's been done and iterate off of it Oh, this new tech this new feature came out cool.
Let's implement it in this all already So we don't have to do the base work. We've already got The foundation already laid. We just got to do that added bit Oh, we want to showcase a feature That we can leverage in our tech stack cool.
Let's enable that feature on this project and see what happens like the ability to To just sit down for two weeks Have that slowdown and go okay Oh Did the thing and now Party time. Let's make it happen.
 Let's let's let's go do it and The two weeks is up and now I'm going to the conference tomorrow And I'm speaking at the conference on Thursday and then I'm skipping the conference on Friday because I have to be here when they install the refrigerator Because that is my life now like the ability to now go back into 120 miles an hour again But to have better tires I guess Like I'm still I'm still moving way too fast but It's better that at least now There's something loaded that I can go okay cool.
I took this time. I learned some things Now when anyone asks me to do something I can I can just point to that thing and then Say okay, most of the work has been done now we can do the easier part now we can we can go in and and make it happen So a lot like you Kathy.
I don't think things are slowing down. Well, I know things aren't slowing down.
 I'm going to for events At the beginning of July Then I'm back home for a week And then I'm going to the relay live show um and then we get back in it's August and my kids are school so Yeah, I'm I'm a little nervous because I'm taking two and a half weeks For London I'm nervous based on like where I'm treading water now.
 I think that's my biggest concern is the fact that I don't know when I'm going to stop treading water So I don't know how much work I'm going to be doing while I'm on quote-unquote vacation um And how that is all going to work and that is that's I think the part that is really Trusting me out because I don't know what it's going to do.
I don't know what's going to happen.
 So yeah So per fun Super fun, but at least we know that we're we're going to be here um And I mean one of the things that I love about this show is that it is it is a break in the chaos Yes, except for when apparently I'm absolutely needed for hey, what was that link for that one thing happened with that And I'm like are you serious right now But usually it is a break in the chaos and I'm able to put a lot of time and energy into helping people and I mean I don't know if people notice the trend for both Kathy and I but we like helping people What what get out of here I'm a jerk so the least I can do is make other people's life slightly more convenient True, that's true Was it the response that I was expecting No, of course not why would you think such a thing that's not to no I can't even But it yeah, I think that's why we get along so well too Um with the exceptions of the terrible takes that you have for some things, but You know coming coming in and just giving giving back helping supporting all of that is is kind of where we're at Which means we have to remind each other To take breaks as well.
 Yeah And we can we can take breaks and we can use those opportunities to Be as helpful as our bodies will allow us to be helpful because I think that Conduit is a is a wonderful baseline of of helping people in that like Sometimes our help is reading your Connection and going hey, I did something like that too Maybe look into this thing Sometimes it's just reading your connection and being like oh, I get it And like commiserating with that person and then sometimes like we don't have enough energy and we just read the connection And like that that is it but At least that allows your voice to be heard and that allows other people to To do that stuff, you know as well that allows for people when we read it and people live or like oh, hey I did that the other week like I love that that's like my favorite response is when someone else hears someone's connection and goes That's cool.
I just got through doing that you should check this resource out.
 I'm like yay Yeah, that's absolutely my favorite yeah, but In in spite of all the chaos we're going to be here doing Doing that and some days we might only be reading the connections and letting our conductors do the the heavy lifting but I tell you like It I look forward to these little breaks these little two hour breaks in the middle of my day Yeah, I agree 100% even if like I'm like And today's a good example Because I had the meeting beforehand.
I was stressed and I was just like oh, I don't want to do it Not that I don't want to do conduit, but I don't want to record. I don't want to you know do all of the setup But then as soon as We got the tech stuff figured out. I'm like oh, yeah, no, I'm good. I'm good. This is great.
Let's do this Yeah, there's something to say about Not Wanting to do the thing and then immediately be like this is why I do the thing.
 Yeah It's like taxes no one wants to do them, but occasionally you get a nice check at the end What's that like I I'm so afraid It's just fear it's fear that you've done something wrong and they're coming for you But what I'm not afraid of is our next sponsor because this episode of conduit is brought to you by e-camp e-camp live is leading video production and live streaming studio built for the Mac e-cam does all aspects of video Not just live streaming.

 I was gonna load it up But then it was like you need to update and I was like nope Not right now But I am a big fan of using e-cam and I'm looking forward to using it more and more even now with zoom where If I want to showcase something like I don't know if people I've tried sharing the screen before It's not great You share your screen and then all of a sudden you're like oh now I got to change screens and you got unshare And click on the new thing and share and that doesn't work So then you're like oh, I don't know what's going on anymore e-cam makes it simple like Everything is just a drop-down you want to go from screen one to screen two drop-down screen two screen three drop-down Oh, you want to load this application window in drag it into the e-cam window and it's there Oh, you want to change your camera drop down.
