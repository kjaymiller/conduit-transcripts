From really FM, you're listening to Conduit, the show where we condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that is here to remind you to take care of your systems. This episode is brought to you by Micro.Blog, Vitaly and Computex.
I'm Kathy and with me today, as in most days, but not all days, because sometimes he's trapsizing all over the US in all sorts of conventions and things. Jay Miller, hi Jay. Yeah, I'm only here on the days that we're not supposed to be here.
Like when I make a big fuss, I thought a day that we're not even recording on. Right. Yeah. So to anyone that basically in this show, we have our fantastic, incredible supporters, shows, supporters, members of the show. That's, yes.
We call them our superconductors and they get to hang out with us in the live stream, but also in our pre-show and our post-show banter.
And today, that included a conversation of, oh, by the way, don't forget, I'm going to be gone next episode or I'm going to be gone the next one, I think is next week.
Is what you said to which I got clarification and confirmation of, do you mean next week because we record this for tonightly next week is our co-working session or do you mean next episode to which you said next episode, except that was incorrect. So don't worry, it's all cleared up.
Episode 102 will have Jay on it unless something terrible happens, but it's not going to happen. So it's fine. And what, hey Jay, what is that, that co-working that I mentioned? Yeah. So in the co-working, we try to get work done or we just talk.
This time there was a lot more talking than working, I think, at least from RNs. We talked about why Celsius is the better temperature system except for places where it's hot and then Fahrenheit is better. No, in weather. It's better in places except for weather.
And we'll know because in cold weather, Celsius is still fine, but in warm weather, Fahrenheit is better. And then because 100 degrees is a nice, like it's hot, but it's also like, if it were 100 degrees, or Celsius, your skin would be peeling off.
But then in cooking, like who knows, we've given up because boiling water, Celsius is good, but then like baking, Fahrenheit feels great. Yeah. It's weird. That's just interesting. That's just interesting. We also talked about a wonderful bridge that's very, very small and is underwater.
And it goes from one part of Toronto to the airport because you can't take cars onto the island because the island is completely separated. And then- Well, we mainly talked about the fairy that exists there instead of an actual bridge. And then we talked about the sense of all of our countries.
And then yeah, that was a fun time. If you liked that kind of fun, I'm a superconductor.com. Letter M, letter A, superconductor.com. Another benefit is hanging out in the discord where in this past week we celebrated Dan Moran being on jeopardy, no spoilers.
And also had some connections on kind of the butterfly effect. And if X hadn't happened, why wouldn't it have happened? And that was nice, fun bonding in one of my favorite places on the internet. How about some shout outs? Last episode was our episode 100 and we got a little bit emotional.
And so did some of our conductors. And specifically, I want to read out this one from Aiden who is our robotics engineer of the show. He says, I played last week's episode in the car with my girlfriend without telling her what was coming later in the episode.
She may have gotten teary eyed when Jay said the nice things about us, which is exactly what this show- not- this show isn't made to make you cry. It's made to make Aiden's girlfriend cry specifically. Yes, exactly. That is why that is our long con. Mission accomplished.
We're shutting this thing down. We did it. We did it. We did it at all. No, it's all about the connections between people and feeling seen, being seen, accountability and also getting things done, not trademarked version of it.
And then do you want to read the other shout outs including the part that calls you out for mistakes that you made? Let's see, Aaron, our identical to one of the show basically said, everybody else sharing their heartfelt thoughts was great. Beautiful words by Sophie and Carl.
Thank you again to Sophie and Carl for their wonderful voice memos that they sent us. And then Aaron said that they think that the second half of the recording was missed for the next connection, so they'll repeat it. The most important part, which was, Jay, you're awesome.
I don't think that's what was said. I mean, that's what I'm reading. Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's get that checked. For the record, it says that I'm the best. Oh, thanks. Yeah. Wow. Wow, we're moving on. It's time for our connection checks. Now, since this is episode 101 yesterday, we are yesterday.
Yeah, the last episode was 100 and it was a celebratory of everything in the past. We're going to go over, it kind of is fitting that this is a systems check episode, which we will discuss a little bit later on.
But I want to give a little bit more kind of context and conversation around connection checks. For if episode 101 is for some reason, you're first episode. And if it is, what's up? If you just do it every episode and like codify what it is. Like have, yeah, okay. So like write things down weird.
So a connection check is kind of an accountability tracker for the next fortnight. Something that you want to work on, whether it's an actual task or a feeling or a habit or a pattern, something that we can help support you in.
Because if you do it publicly, if you say something publicly is going to happen through brains, human brains, you're more likely to probably get it done or at the very least, you're going to allow us to help support you if you didn't. And that's also okay.
Because we want to make sure that you are like existing in your life at the best that you can, whatever that means for you. It's life is hard. Work relationships, people existing is difficult. And one of those things that can help is having a little bit of support system.
So that is what we do here at Conduit. The beginning of the show, we are reflecting on our past fortnight's connection checks. And seeing how both the us two hosts, but then also how our conductors did as well. So Jay, how did you do? Yeah, it's a big fat failure for me.
I was supposed to log my mood to maybe get into a better mood. I will say I've been in a better mood. That was until all of the world came tumbling down for reasons that we can't discuss publicly on this show yet. But there is, there was a lot of, I've been extra moody lately.
And I think a lot of it has been sleep, some of it has been health. And I wanted to log my mood just to see if I could identify some type of pattern or trend. Moody was not tracked. I think I did what's in then after that. I was like, but I didn't do it.
And I don't really have an excuse to say so I didn't do it other than didn't quite feel like it. Well, and that's in my mind that I think that's totally fine because this is a way to see about adding new habits or trying new things.
And it's okay if the answer is nope, because you know you're not going to keep up with it. You're not going to like it. You're not going to, you know, whatever. That is, that is okay.
I think the interesting challenge with like tracking is like mood tracking, I guess, can be useful if you're just tracking it over a large period of time. But you also need to be tracking like other things to help attribute to that mood.
And that was where like apples, like reflections or mood app or whatever they call it. I don't remember either.
It just saying, Hey, how are you feeling? If I go, man, then like, it'll go, Oh, why do you feel man? What are all the reasons why you feel man? I don't want to think about this right now. I just want to say man, keep it moving. That's why I love our previous sponsor, the P app.
Like, I just push the button and then I keep it moving. I don't have to think too hard about it. Yeah. Well, and also it depends on when it comes up. So right as you're going to bed. Right. My Sunday, my Sunday was great until it wasn't.
And so it depends entirely on when that question would have been asked because by the end of the day, it was okay again.
But there was a section in the middle of the day that I actually took a very long walk with the dog in the rain because it was great to just let the like the tears get wiped away by the rain. And it was a very cathartic, I felt very main character, very movie era vibes. So it was great.
It was very, it was helpful. But that would have been a very different answer that I would have had if I had been asked. And so my connection was to work on journaling for Reels this time. And I have, and I'm actually glad that I did.
So in going through this, I've kind of been able to help reformat. It was the first couple sentences of each journal entry has been kind of exactly the same. And that actually helped me re-correct kind of my mindset. This is not a woo-woo podcast.
We're not going to talk about blah, blah, blah, you know, vibes, energy, etc. Except for when we are. And we're not going to say, you know, you need to go out and get your crystals to get this done. But one of the things, you know, mindset is a thing. Mindfulness, you practice.
Mindfulness, just being an awareness, having an awareness of kind of where your brain is sitting. Why, why you might do some things or why you don't want to do some things. That type of stuff. And so, so far it's been, it's been good.
I do love apples, meditation, training, except for every time it tells me like, listen to your body. And I'm like, it's 730 in the morning. My body says it's hungry right now. Like don't, like, well, that's exactly what I ended to do. It's telling you that you're hungry and you should go fix it.
So yeah. What about our conductors? They didn't do anything. I'm kidding. Give me time. Wow. Wow. You're going to get us canceled. Well, our Esperanto nitter of the show, Eris Anya says, dragon eating all the chocolate worked. The CT scan results came back and those scary things are found.
This is a great news. And unfortunately, also means it a few more uncomfortable tests and appointments. But the big doom cloud has certainly shrank and it helps a lot. I totally think it's because of the chocolate. I mean, hey, chocolate. Yeah, absolutely.
Our artist of the show Carly says, connection check, green circle. I got a job. It's a temp job again, but it's much better than being unemployed. Congratulations. That's so exciting. Congrats. Our chief Swiftie of the show, Andrew says, uh, checkmark, I'm, I need to make this bigger.
I can't read it. I thought it said I'm ranked. I was like, what? You can zoom in. Oh, no, I made it smaller. I mean, oh, no, now I'm opening one password. Everything is broken. I hit the wrong keys. Oh, no. Okay, there we go. I'm going blind, apparently. This is, this is the thing. I'm being old.
I'm not old. All right, green check mark. I'm making progress on defining my role. It's so that squishy elements. Yet I'm finding my voice and helping everyone find their lanes.
With a small team of five, we have to be agile and throwing on a turn signal to switch lanes as needed to support one another. Yet we still need to have defined lanes so that we have structure and clarity. Well, Andrew, let me, uh, let me throw this out at you.
My small team of four instead of, uh, just having our own lanes. Yeah, it's more like NASCAR. We're just like, going, you know, we're just making left turns. That's what we're doing. Oh my goodness. That sounds totally fine. I'm like, it's totally fine. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
I shouldn't have put me in charge, I guess. Our code, Mikey, of this show, Douglas says, connection check, green check mark, successfully completed a major project and simplified my life a bunch at the same time. Shut down one entire line of work. That is really impressive. Well done.
I have a very hard time. Um, stop ending things. So you should be very proud. Our checklist enthusiasts of the show, Mike says green check mark. I enjoyed a vacation and disconnected from work. And I had a great time celebrating my daughter's fifth birthday at Disney World.
I should have read this one because we, everyone knows how much you hate Disney. Oh, no, that's fine. I mean, at least you went to the superior of the two Disney's in America.
So like, our soprano of the show, Debo says connection check, green heart, met with the personal trainer and already have another appointment set up for this week. Well done. That's amazing. Good job. Our identical twin of the show, Aaron says green circle.
I kept up my freelancing work, but also more things keep coming up good for keeping busy, but also hard to make time to relax.
Yeah, that's the, that's the reason why I don't want to go into freelancing is that you, you have to be your own boss, but a part of being your own boss also means you have to be your own like HR department as well. And make sure that you're practicing good, like work, life, balance.
Because no one's going to, no one's going to tell you no. And if no one tells you no, you'll just keep, you'll just keep adding work on until you realize your underwater. At least that's what I would do. Yes, that's a good, that's a good call there. I'm sorry, I was adding another one.
The, ah, of the show, ah says connection check, red, ex, I got super busy and forgot my connection existed at all. Whoops, that's okay. It happens. It happens often. And that is not a problem at all. It'd be like that sometimes.
Our robotics engineer, the show Aiden says green heart, I think we figured out all the obvious next steps and we're looking forward to discovering the not so obvious ones in a month.
I mean, hey, you got to listen to the prejaro where we talked about being comfortable in your relationships to like pass gas in front of each other. And if you live together than like, yeah, it's going to be really uncomfortable until you get to that point.
Our fish bear of the show, Fishy Kai says green heart, I've made steady progress on the pile of household admin. Not finished yet, but I'm giving myself a green because I have momentum and I'll be pretty much caught up by the weekend. Well, frigging done.
This is a perfect example of how to use that green, even if the project quote unquote project isn't fully done. So great job. And our tech podcast listener of the show, wait, nope, miss one. Our name list of the show nameless says green circle. I started on the documentation.
I think we are as prepared as we can be for the next event. I also followed up on the job applications. Nothing yet, but I'm going to keep my head up and keep applying. Yep, always be applying. I think Kathy puts claps in there for everyone's and always always be applying.
Yeah, unless you're me because nobody wants to hire me for a real job, and yeah, that's a whole other conversation. Anyways, last connection comes from Pillix, our tech podcast listener of the show, who did the fun things. So her Ray, well done. This episode of Condo It is brought to you by micro.
blog. Blogging is still the easiest way to share stuff on the web. And micro.blog is the easiest way to blog. Personal blogging is making a comeback thanks to all the disruption in social media.

It's systems check 101 plus spring 2025 at the same time. Lots of numbers in there. That's fine. What is a systems check? Well, in the show, we don't really talk about specifics a whole lot. We talk about specifics, but we don't talk about specific apps or products necessarily.
Both of us strongly believe that what works for someone is not going to work for everybody. Because this product was life changing for someone, it's also not that doesn't automatically mean that it's going to be life changing for you. The same thing with self-help books.
A lot of times self-help books could be condensed into a single blog post or even just a paragraph. They don't need to be full books. Even then, it's something that worked for this particular person. If it does not work for you, that does not mean that you are a failure.
That's something we're trying to get across. Such as life. That is just the way it goes. But once a quarter, we like to come and discuss what we are currently using for products, apps, etc. in order to get things done in our daily lives. Both of us are very busy.
We're running around all over the place, doing things, getting things, finishing things, starting projects, etc., etc. And somehow we have to try and keep it under control as best that we can. And what that means is we have tools in place that let us do that.
And the reason that we do this quarterly is because it's helpful to sit and look at what is working, what is not working, and make adjustments. Your system probably will never stay the same. And if it does, you are super lucky. Congratulations.
I'm not saying that you need to be constantly hack your productivity in order to be the best person that you can be. Glow up to be the best summer girly in the fall. Like blah blah blah. Like none of those, that's not what we're doing here.
We just want to make sure that you can be the best that you can be. In the non-Army tagline way. I don't think they use that tagline anymore. Well, it doesn't matter they did in the past. Which are out of your service. Anyways, moving on.
So we are going to go through each of our setups, talking about the apps and tools and things that we are currently using.
For the idea of maybe if there's something that sounds good, if there's something that you can take with you, but by knowing should you immediately decide that you want to translate what we do fully to your own life because it's probably not going to work. So let's get started.
Jay, how's your system doing? Do you have a fun name for it this year? Nope. Okay. That's cool. I've kind of outgrown the names. They're just Jay's system now. Yeah. No, I just honestly forgot. This has been a weird quarter for me.
I spent the first part of the year trying to move into this leadership position and then kind of adopting, I guess, are adapting to the changes that come with my job with their being a new component of also can be concerned about other people in that because my system is all about me.
But when I got to think about other people, then it's all about we. And then that's kind of a little, that's a lot different. And again, I've talked about how some of that has affected my mood long, you know, in the past and things like that. So there's been, there's been a few developments.
And I don't know what they fully mean, but I'm trying to dissect them. The first one is I've been, I've been focused in some ways more on organization and cleanliness. This started a while back.
If you remember the episode we did with or that I did with Merlin Man, we were talking a lot about 3D printing and things like that.
One of the things that I've been doing is 3D printing this system called multi board that is basically like a giant hexagonal grid system that you can attach to your walls and hang things from your walls with.
So I've been, I've been doing that a lot and then getting involved in just like creating bins and different baskets and things like that.
And I've been hoping that as I simplify my environment, not necessarily for like a minimalism or anything like that perspective, but just like a, I don't want to look out and see clutter. I want to look out and see like things that were, I guess, intentionally placed there.
So you want to say intentionality or whatever, like that's fine. I'm hoping that that will adjust my mood for the better. I'm still the trees still out on that though. Did you want to talk about that one, Kathy? I mean, are we like a geared mood? We're talking about your mood.
The like organization affecting mood, cleanliness, everything mood. It's so funny because when I saw the note of cleanliness affects mood in the show notes, I looked at my absolute disaster of a desk in my office and I was like, yeah, I should probably do something about that.
So I'm pretty sure I know what I'm going to be doing this afternoon. And I mean, part of it is, and we'll talk a little bit later about this, but like I'm currently in kind of packing mode and sorting through that kind of stuff.
And so I have lots of things on the desk that I'm like, oh, yeah, I need this. Let me put this here. Let me just put this here. So it will go where it needs to go. And that's not necessarily the best way to do it, but it is how my brain works right this second.
So yeah, I will hopefully be doing some cleaning in my office later today. Yeah. So I will skip it down because I think a part of the cleanliness and thing, actually, I'll keep going in the direction. So it's also on top of the whole cleanliness and mood thing.
I've been trying to think more and more about like the cleanliness of like my systems as well.
And that also includes just like what system has what information on it and what tools am I using? Since we are allowed to get a little more specific on tools and things, I recently started testing out raycast. I've been a long time Alfred user.
Okay, you're going to need to use more words on what the heck raycast is and why it matters. Okay. So Kathy, on your computer, do you ever hit command space? All the time. And I hate Alfred, but that's cool. So you hate Alfred. I've been a long time Alfred user.
I've been a super, actually, I could probably tell you because this computer still uses Alfred. So I can tell you how long I've been a PowerPak user. Oh no, they got rid of that. I thought it used to say like PowerPak user since whatever, whatever.
But I've been a PowerPak user since like probably for almost seven, eight, nine years. I used to do a lot of automation within Alfred. Check out my YouTube channel for really bad hairstyles and like old Alfred videos.
But to someone that doesn't know what's Alfred Alfred is a replacement command launcher for your laptop, specifically your Mac because it's Apple only product. And you can use it to do things like open certain apps. You can do things like it has like a built-in calculator.
You can have a you can add a clipboard manager to it. You can use it to trigger hot keys and do like some small automation stuff there. But it also has this larger like template workflow style thing.
And for instance, so I have I used to have tons of these automations that would do a bunch of different things. Now I have one and it's called open conduit. And literally when I open Alfred and I type in conduit, what it does, it'll say do you want to open conduit and I hit enter.
And it launches audio hijack. And it actually launches the exact profile that we use for recording the show. It opens up our Google Drive and then it launches zoom and opens up the zoom link that we use for the call. So like all I have to do is I open conduit and then like everything opens.
Now I could do this so many different ways. Like there are I've done this so many different ways. Bunch is another tool that I've used in the past to do something similar. I don't know why I started doing it with Alfred. I just I just did one day and now it's there.
But at some point I upgraded to a major version and all my old workflows were gone. And I was like I should add them back and then I added the conduit one and then I never added anything else.
So there's another tool called Raycast that is similar to Alfred in that it's primary like focus is opening different applications. But it also has some tools that allow you to do automation stuff.
It also has a calculator and it has this very comprehensive store to where you can have it integrate with apps and things that you have on your machine already. I don't know what all is in the store. I'm wondering if there's like an audio hijack one. I bet there probably is.
Let me see I'm just going to open this up go to store hit enter type and we'll continue and then type in audio. No audio hijack. Oh well. No, well there's a bunch of other like audio stuff in here like audio writers. I can set the audio device to a different one.
I can mute my microphone really quickly with it. Like it's it's way more comprehensive than Alfred and has a better ecosystem around having a bunch of these little features built in for you. And to be honest, that's actually not why I wanted to use it. I just wanted to use something different.
I was like, I was like, I've seen this. There was this like they have this sync feature to where like you can have all of your settings on one device and then have them be the same settings on the other, which was appealing to me because I do drive to laptops.
My personal laptop is M1 MacBook Air or M2 MacBook Air. It's M something MacBook Air. And then my work laptop is M1 Max MacBook Pro. So I'm like, sometimes I'm bouncing back and forth between them.
And the thing that I've been wanting to do is make it so that the experience on one is as close to the experience on the other so that I don't feel like I have to memorize two different workflows. So that was the whole reason for switching to Raycasts.
There is apparently also some other features in there that are like get you like you can program it and have it do all this other stuff. I'm really not interested. But I've been doing that. I've been playing around with different ways to do things for developers.
Most developers are very familiar with the tool Git, which is a version control system. It makes it so that I can write my code. Kathy, I think we talked about this at one point for one of our members. So yeah, definitely. So definitely. When you write your awesome code.
And you want to add your code to the internet, specifically like GitHub or GitLab. We try to do all the time. Yeah. Because everyone needs to know what I'm coding. Exactly. You use a version control system called Git. Obviously. You do that. There are other systems.
And before people ask if I'm coming from my curial or subversion, no, I'm not. There's a new tool called JJ. I shouldn't say it's new. It's been around for a few years. It's a different way of using Git. That's all it is. But it is a big mental shift in how you use Git. And I watched a video on it.
I was intrigued. And I was like, I've been in a rut for a long time with some of my projects where I haven't really been able to think about them very much. And I just wanted to try using something different. So this has been great. And then the last the last tool I'm adding these to the notes now.
The last tool that I have been using is it's an AI tool. Before people come for me, I don't care. It's called it's cloud code. I pay for cloud. Clod is me and clutter homies. I'm not trying to like build the next greatest app through vibe coding or like having it do things.
But there are some very mundane tasks that I will not do. And it's not that I'm too good to do them. It's just I will just straight up forget to not do I'll forget to do them. Or I will be like, yeah, I'll get to that later. And then we all know that I don't get to it later.
So I've been having it like go through and create readmes and things like that. And I'll tell it what to include. I'll give it the outline and just let it populate from there.
But I've also been using it to help me troubleshoot like weird terminal like errors that I'm getting where like if something's not working right. I'm like, hey, can you fix this? And it'll like, I'm looking at this thing now. It looks like this is set to this.
Should I change it? I'm like, sure, why not? Like just because again, like I love the idea of a tool that allows me to think about the things that I want to think about and not think about the things that I don't want to think about.
And I do think that that's one of the things that AI is relatively good at as a developer or like in the developer space is like, it can do a lot of stuff that isn't I'm not going to say that isn't important. But takes more time than you probably want to spend on it.
And if you could just and people have been automating the process for years, other ways. So this is just yet another way of doing the thing. So I'm kind of like, yeah, whatever, it's it's the accurate way of doing it right now.
And the whole reason for like wanting to do this is I'm wanting to consolidate my systems down. I'm wanting to simplify them. And then I'm wanting to organize things so that I can start building what it's called a home lab.
And a home lab is literally just like a system of servers and computers and things to like move things on. I have a Cal digit. Kathy, you're familiar with the Cal digit, you know, the whole thing. Let's pretend like I'm not.
A Cal digit is a USB hub basically, except for it's like it also can hold your monitors and your network connection. It's a dock. I think of it as like a docking station for your computer. Yes, of course. My Cal digit has a two terabyte external hard drive attached to it at all times.
And that is where I am now storing all of my podcast episodes or the recordings for the podcast because again, I just have a problem where I feel like I have to have a copy of everything that I record at least for five years in the after that. I can go away.
So yes, I keep a copy of the individual broken down components of our podcast. And I copy it over to my external hard drive. But I use the same docking station for both laptops. So I'm just constantly unplugging my docking station between the two devices.
And I'm always just improperly ejecting the drive, which that's annoying. Most of the time, it's not a problem. Except for when it is. Except for when it is.
So there's like, there's there's this initial desire to be like, I want to set up an old Raspberry Pi that I have to basically just be a file server that is always on and always connected to the network so that I can just drag and drop the files.
I can disconnect my external hard drive to the cow digit or from the cow digit and then just not be constantly emergency ejecto seating my external hard drive, which could cause problems in the long run. And then from there, there's the question of I could run servers and other things like that.
All of my Docker instances and all those things could live on there if I really wanted them to. But we'll see. Homelabbing is like, it's like a lifestyle. You start in one area and then all of a sudden you're like, oh, I can move this to the home lab. Oh, then I could spin up this thing.
And then you could do this thing. And that's like, that's all a bunch of stuff. Yeah. That's, this is where one of many reasons many, many, many places that we are very different because that sounds terrible. I mean, you're not wrong.
And I'm not going to say like, it's something that I'm super excited about. But it's a, it's a thing that I know that I can build it. It's on a Raspberry Pi. So I just like, leave it on, leave it in the corner of my room and then never touch it again if I really wanted to. And that would be fine.
And nameless here says, I've been wanting to do a home lab, but I don't have a need or budget. But I want an excuse to play with all the fun tech toys. Again, Raspberry Pi, you can, you can do this in under $100. Like, if you really want to just play around with one.
But speaking of new toys, Kathy, you've heard me complain about being distracted about needing to figure out my systems and all this other stuff. And I've talked about buying stuff. If I told you I bought a new toy, what do you think that new toy would be? Listen, okay, okay, context clues.
I am wondering if it's one of those remarkable. Oh my gosh. How did you know? Because I'm a genius. Nailed it. Wow. So I, I messaged Kathy yesterday in reminding that it was like, Hey, it's a systems check.
Also, this thing that's arriving today will probably either be like a game changer or the biggest waste of money. And the job is still out. So I don't know. It's only I've only had it for a day. But I did. I got the remarkable paper pro.
I didn't get the big fancy bundle with all the, I got the pin, but I didn't get like the, the keyboard folio and stuff. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, I have zero desire. Listen, I know you. Okay. I know you. Okay, that's fair. That's fair.
So the reason, the reasons for doing this, for those that don't know, I've been thinking about getting a remarkable tablet for about five years now since the first one came out. Yeah. And I never pulled the trigger because I was like, this is a waste of time, energy and money, mostly money.
I have been to three events this year in which I did not bring my notebook. And I wanted to take notes. So I took notes on my laptop to which I got distracted. And I stopped paying attention to what the speaker was saying.
And instead, I was just like working on stuff or watching YouTube videos or whatever. And then like, or not watching YouTube videos, that would be rude. That would be like the ultimate root. Yeah. Wow. Answering Slack, Slack messages, like checking email, doing everything, but paying attention.
And like, I want to, I would not bring my emotional support notebook. Exactly. Because I have two of them. Yeah. And like, we've been talking about this fight between like my day, my planner and then like my notebooks. And that's been kind of a frustration. Oh, nameless. That's a really good idea.
He's been using a Kindle as a speaker cards. And it's that's that's a really good like, undistracting, undistractioning, less distractioning, and product item option things. Yeah. Very cool. Yeah. So that's that's kind of where I'm at with it.
I haven't I haven't quite figured out like what I'm doing now is I'm doing the like all in on this to figure out what works well and what doesn't. I do like that it has a different paper types, which is really great. And I do like that I can copy and paste from the the paper types.
And then like the way that I like I set up my daily, my weekly planner is that like I have the weekly calendar spread that I just fill out. And then I just select the day and then copy it over to a blank page.
And then I just write out the notes around the things that are on the calendar, which is like really cool. And it's it's actually made me think about how I structure information kind of in a different way. Yeah.
 So I was like, that's that's it's already like a day in and I'm already seeing like again, having the tactile way of like I'm writing this stuff down on top of the like I can grab what I just wrote down and copy and paste is like a happy medium between the technical super like, oh, I could just type whatever I want.
Not think about it versus the handwritten like I'm actively store processing this information as I'm writing it. So it's like it's it's the cheat code. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that I like. But I also love pins and paper weights too much to be like I will not invest in paper and pins.
So again, I'm just trying to figure out where does this fit in my workflow? Is it used just for travel? Is it used for like travel and meetings? Is it doesn't replace notebooks for me completely? I don't think it will. But like maybe it does. I don't know. The jury is still out.
Yeah, I love that real quick. I'm going to hop in here because and talk about notebooks too because obviously that's that's the way I live. But I somewhere in my house, I have an huge bag. I think it's a paper bag somewhere full of field notes.
I also found my little traveler's notebook, leather bound little field note size that looks like a Tartus. It's great. Super cute. I love it. It has a little pen loop thing. And I'm like, this is perfect because I want to be able to I'm actually since I'm okay.
So I'm going to Taiwan next week to cover tone, compete, compete text. There's an ad at the end of the show. Listen to it if you'd like or not. We might keep it in the pro show, the members show to talk. I don't know either way. You figured out either way.
What? Because I'm not because I'm the only one going this year. I don't have Rose to fall back on for technical questions. She is very much a techie. I am not a tech reporter. I am not a tech. I just use it. And so I'm coming about this coverage as a non super techie person.
And like what I am planning on doing is because of the tactileness of like writing in my hands. I like I want to be able to write it with my fingers. And so I have this field notes. Again, could not find the huge thing of it. And I needed the only ones that I could find were lined.
And that's not right. And so I had to order some more. I had to order some more field notes. And it felt very gross. But it was something that I had to do. So they they are coming today. And see this brings up the whole like I do have a wallet that is a Midori traveler's notebook.
But I watched it and then all the paper disintegrated. Oh, no. Was like a real feeling. But then there was also like the whole. Do I open up another field notes and put it in there. And then now I have at least a little pocket notebook on me. And that's what I usually will have.
And the problem is like that little pocket notebook is not. It's not meant for what I'm trying to do with these events. Right. And then also it's important. It's okay to have things like. You know, you're to have a tool that is only for one specific thing. There is nothing wrong.
Like nothing in your life is required to be a multi-purpose tool. It is okay to have multiple tools to get things done if it works. And there's also just kind of the world that you know, we were talking a few episodes ago.
Maybe it was in the post show about our very, very fancy like we go on flights and sometimes like my work laptop is way too big to go on to a flight. So having a smaller like pad that I can just write on and actually plan and think about and act on, you know, regularly.
While I'm in the air really does allow me to get, you know, to get my thoughts organized and stuff like I'm thinking about how usually I would write some type of blog post for whatever after I go on a trip like this. And I'm going to be like sitting on the plane for two hours.
I'm going to just be like normally I would just be sitting there with my thoughts or I would be on my phone. And then it would be like type type type. Oh, I got a message. Get distracted. Go back type type and not thinking about stuff with this. I can just write my thoughts down.
Even if I just like outline them really ugly or mind map them or whatever, like I can just be in my thoughts and get it done and then not be distracted from the rest of the world. Thanks for the reminder. I need to charge my little I've had many keyboard because I'm that doesn't matter.
That's a that's a future topic maybe our travel tech setup or some I don't know. We'll talk about that maybe. Well, well, speaking of yapping, I've been doing it for way too long. Kathy. Let's do our sponsor. This episode of Condo is brought to you by your friends at Vitaly.

OK, so my systems is going to be very similar to previous ones, but with a little change up in tools. So I am still going strong with my bullet journal. The majority of the time I am just doing weekly spreads. I use a notebook therapy notebook. It's actually almost done. So that's exciting.
I get a new notebook. I'm very excited for that. And I write out what my schedule looks like. So I have meetings and appointments and everything written out. I do not use this as my vial and all. Like this is what I'm doing today type of a thing.
So much as this is times that I'm going to need to leave the house or I'm going to be unavailable or whatever to just kind of remind myself something that I've written down. So I'm renewed of like I'm not forgetting anything.
It's really helpful to just have that that's kind of what I do Monday morning. I sit down and I write out my week. And then I also on the side of it usually on one side. Sometimes the bottom my layouts change.
It's not the same every time, which is helpful for my brain to keep it interesting and stay aware of it. Is usually just kind of a go-to task list. Now this is not necessarily.
So I do use OmniFocus for repeat tasks for bigger projects for okay here are the 30 sub tasks for a thing that I need to get done that are not in any of my other like client-based things. OmniFocus lives there. I also do use Apple reminders for when I arrive like for location-based stuff.
A lot of times if I'm out going grocery shopping or getting picking up something or whatever if I'm in the car I will remind my Apple dingus or I will tell my Apple dingus to remind me when I get home to do X. This way it's reminded I obviously can't write it down because I'm driving.
And I want to make sure that I don't forget. And so that's how that works. And so having the bullet journal on my paper on my desk is usually open. I got a little like a cookbook wooden cookbook stand that my journal lives in on my desk when I'm not actively writing on it.
So it takes up less space on my desk. Especially since I have a running notebook for a long time I've used the what's it called the cortex brand notebook. The psychic. Yep. The psychic. No pad that could psychically tell me what I need to do.
However I've learned that it's not quite for me mainly because of the tariff. So my problem is is I don't need to just get rid of the paper all the time. Sometimes I need to keep it which means it sticks around which means it gets everywhere which means it adds to the mess.
There's not a place to really put them for the ones that I need to keep. But I do have a studio neat a panel book that I'm using instead. It's spiral bound spiral is on the side which is fine because I'm not like resting on the notebook.
And it seems to be working a little bit better for kind of what I'm looking for. And again you're mileage to be very this is once again this segment of the show is not to tell you what to buy so much as hey here's some things that are changing.
Still love my mark one that's my go to pen most of the time to write everywhere. I actually use my purple one for journaling which is fun.
And then when I'm like the nice thing about most of these tools is that it works if I'm going to be sitting on the desk in my laptop or at my desktop for the most part.
And so I really appreciate the fact like a lot of the tools are sinking so I know that my omnifocus is going to be the exact same on my laptop as on my desktop. So that's pretty great. Yeah that's kind of kind of it.
I have my system is a little bit different in that I do have a lot of different like task managers and and stuff for different clients. So I have like five different work spaces I think they're called in Asana for different clients.
I have notion, I've got you know just a wide variety of things depending on what my client needs. That is the bigger like if my client needs wants to use a tool I will use that tool with them because that's how I support them in what they're doing. So yeah that is my system.
Which one is your favorite tool that you support people with but you don't use in your day-to-day? Asana. Asana yeah. Okay.
By default when I start working with a new client and we get to the point where we need a task management software of some point if they don't have one I immediately will do Asana. The free version is so good. It's very like full purpose.
I only have one client that we're on a paid version and that's for very specific reasons that you probably if you're listening to this don't have. It is you can set things up in different ways so you can do things in a can ban board or just a regular to-do list.
You can have multiple subtasks that like like folder out multiple multiple ways so you can go like six subtasks deep or whatever. Assigning automation all sorts of things that are really really fantastic and so far it hasn't had any random AI things pop up that are like let's do your stuff for you.
So two thumbs up for Asana. I hate to break it to you that's coming. I know. But that's okay. You know we'll we'll work through. Oh look it's what happens here. Yeah. AI is no longer a tool. It's a teammate. Oh no. Asana AI works alongside your teams.
Doing work for you with full context of your business and goals. That sounds terrible. No, no. Okay. Well at least listen I didn't know about it which is good. But that means it's not throwing itself up in my face so I appreciate that.
The thing that I was thinking about with this is that I feel like and this is hey my name is Jay and I work for a product company. I work for a company that has a software product and I'm going to have some opinions. These are my opinions on my employers. Sorry.
A lot of these products features are often designed for lock in for vendor lock in. Especially when we start talking about these AI tools. Oh we we have all of your data already here. So we have all the context built in. If you were to leave you would lose all that context.
So you might as well just stay here. By the way we're increasing the price. So like there's there's a lot of that going on at the moment. Asana I do kind of like how Asana has always worked from a position of we're not going to put that directly in front of you.
Unfortunately our team just stopped using Asana a year ago and started making the switch to a different tool that recently got acquired and then started shoving AI into everything.
But there is a lot of there's a lot of of these features that are coming in now and like notion notion was kind of meant to be like the everything app. Do you remember Tana? No. You don't remember me playing around with Tana in the early like early early early early early days of the podcast.
Did you miss the part where we talked about I forget a whole bunch of things? I mean craft has its own AI stuff. Yeah I know I think we know this most most places have AI stuff.
Yeah but I I remember like some of these companies are completely pivoting their entire product to be focused around this AI thing and Asana was like I was like Asana have so much faith in you and then all of a sudden it's like we'll do the work for you and I'm like oh don't want that.
I don't want that at all. This feels scary. Yeah. But again that's my biases are all in there and it's definitely that but I was genuinely interested in why there hasn't been like a particular product that you like using that you've just adopted for yourself. I like the context switching.
I like the fact that I don't have so when I go to Asana I know it's for client work.
 I know that it's going to like it helps frame my brain on what I'm concentrating on like what part I'm working on so I'm not like not that I have ever you know asked the question to the wrong client that I can remember but like it's just yeah this is this is just what I'm doing I'm just going to come in and when I'm in this workspace I'm working on this client etc etc and that really is helpful.
 I feel like you're you're even if you did ask the wrong question to the to the to you know to the whatever you're ever you're working for I feel like they just like you're just that important okay you've got you've got that many clients that it's sometimes it's just hard to keep up with with all of them you know yeah something like that yeah how about I redo our third sponsor I like that this episode of conduit is brought to you by Computex 2025 Computex 2025 is the major global technology exhibition at the Taipei Nangang exhibition center and it's happening this month from May 20th to May 23rd the theme this year is AI next where the future of technology comes to life Computex 2025 will focus on three major themes AI and robotics next gen technologies and future mobility and how these areas are shaping industries around the world now I am super excited to be able to go this year I will be in Taipei I leave in about less than four days to when yep three days and I cannot wait I had a great time last year Rosemary or Triton I went and this year I'm a little bit nervous about going by myself just because I don't have rose to ask silly tech questions too but that's okay I'm coming into this as a non-tech podcaster podcaster I don't write articles on fancy tech blogs I don't you know that's not my life and so what I'm hoping to bring to this is here is my mindset from someone who is tech adjacent and I am excited to kind of see what's out there if you've heard me talk about AI in a variety of places I have very mixed thoughts on this my so many thoughts that are is not for this section so I'm excited to kind of see how they're them what the messaging is and what they're presenting in order to kind of see what the future might bring so this year's exhibits will highlight the latest advancements in AI and robotics now as a roboism you know I'm there I'm all there for all of the robots so very excited for that from intelligence service technologies and system

live it will be live um yep this next so the next conduit is going to be easy for me because it's just going to be figure out what this thing do and how it fits into my system so i'm going to i'm going to play around more with my um remarkable tablet and just really more than anything focus on where does this fit in the system is it my daily planner now is it just for doodles and travel or is it or am i going to find some like completely never before seen productivity like unlock with it probably not um we'll we'll find out though uh what about you kathy i am going to um combat my imposter syndrome and talk about tech in a way that feels authentic to me i like it i like it you should do that with uh uh jensen wang who's the CEO of in video and then when he's excited just hang out um totally just being you know i will a definitely um not have any issues recognizing him with my face blindness that's going to be not a problem at all look for the coolest jacket okay yeah yeah perfect all right what about our conductors so our esperanto nitter of the show iris on you says new connection it suddenly got hot here i'm an Amsterdam my chocolate melted we'll explore getting a mobile ac unit which i have resisted so far because i have a ceiling fan but the heat is affecting my health and i want to be extra vigilant about it i also registered for the polyglot gathering in bernot chequia at the end of the month uh in may so i need to prepare and plan for that i struggled with planning things like this because the health stuff was so overwhelming and it's a very good sign i had and have the capacity to do the registration and check things i will also keep eating all the chocolate because clearly it is the magic ingredient yes great and and it's what's giving you the push to get a mobile ac unit which life-changing um we have uh three in our house um so i two thumbs up to a mobile ac unit in a house that does not have air conditioning our artist of the show carly says new connection keep working on my cross-stitch piece i don't want to let my hobbies art go while i'm working yes very important our chiefswifty of the show Andrew says uh clear out my home office desk so

is a good thing and i'm not changing actual employers which is even better yes that is a perfect perfect amazing situation congratulations that is beautiful um our trickless enthusiasts of the show mike says go ship out all the returns and other packages i need to send have some amazon returns and an old device trade in to send back our soprano of the show deba says next connection need to figure out what to do with my husband's retirement account from an old employer that went out of business we have a hard deadline of may 20th to deal with that oh good luck good luck good luck our identical tone of the show Aaron says uh next connection actually take it easy this long weekend wait we got a long weekend some people do oh i don't know what it is because i never have i don't know i'm sure it's a holiday happy happy whatever holiday it is for you day long weekend day our pathologist of the show Laura says new connection i'd like my new connection to just be to enjoy the first reading retreat i'm signed up for this weekend but i know i'll do that without needing a connection for it instead i'll be responsible and say to complete a task i'm intimidated by writing a comprehensive but succinct educational notice to go out to many many people for an important project during this fortnight that sounds extremely stressful and i know that you can do it the uh of the show says let's try this again empty the box is 2 electric boo glu ois a robotics engineer of the show eight and says next connection start taking my lunchtime walks again.
It's actually warm here now. So I have even fewer excuses. Yeah, man, lunchtime walks really are fantastic. Lunchtime walks are great. Our fish spare of the show, Fitchi Kai says, I've been super loaded with responsibilities for a while. I need to car out time for fun. Yes. Yes.
That fun going through the fun. Nameless of the show nameless says new connections start finalizing my talks for the upcoming church conference one month left. Also a sign up for some PM certification classes. Apparently my education isn't enough for some jobs. Oh my gosh, that's so frustrating.
I'm so sorry. It's the worst. It's the worst. And then our tech podcast, the star of the show, Pillik says connection check did the fun things new connection. Maybe do an iOS widget for, oh, for the lulls. I was like for low. So I was like, I don't know who is. Yeah, Lois. Sure.
And our final connection comes from a new super conductor who submitted their feedback. He is the bitchomper of the show, but I don't know what his name is. And that's okay. But our bitchomper of the show says my connection is to get all of the old toddler clothes and shows and shoes. I'm guessing.
Oh, let's try this again. Either honestly. My connection is to get all of the old toddler clothes and shoes boxed up and donated their stuff from two sizes ago. Still in the dresser. I yeah, toddlers keep flipping growing all the time.
And then suddenly they are teenagers and driving around themselves. Yeah, it's bananas. And their shows aren't that great either. So if you can box up, go for a moment. Please do. Oh, no, but keep blue. Bluey, bluey, two thumbs up. Mm. Shut up.
Anyways, if you would like to submit a connection, you can do so in the relay discord in the hashtag show follow up channel by starting your message with a conduit emoji and putting your connection after you can also submit feedback by clicking.
You can also submit it via feedback by clicking in the my goodness. That's what you get. You can also submit it via feedback by clicking the link in the show notes or using the submit feedback button at relay.fm slash conduit.
And since this is, you know, one on one, it can be intimidating to do that first connection. And just know that whenever you submit it is the perfect time. Whenever you do it is the great time. We're here to support. If you have any questions, you can also, you know, ask the questions via feedback.
And we will help get you kind of sorted out. We're here to support you because we want you to be a part of this community and be in our family. And another way to do that is to visit I am a superconductor.
