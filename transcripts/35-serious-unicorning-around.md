From Relay F.O. you're listening to Conduit, the show we Condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that supports silliness seriously. This episode is brought to you by Trade Coffee and Hover.
I'm Jay and with me is the silliest unicorn I know, the one Kathy Campbell. Hi Kathy. Oh, that's me. I am very silly as anyone who's ever spoken to me knows. And I'm super excited to be back with you. Yeah, I've I've been gone, but I'm back and I think I'm back for the rest of the year.
Can't say the same from a co-host. I'm a spoiler. I won't be, but that's fine. That's okay. We'll have a special guest when that happens. But let's let's start the show by talking about all the things happened while I wasn't at the show. Right.
Like the amazing James hanging out with me last episode. We've gotten some really wonderful feedback and support for James and everyone. And I just want to say thank you for everyone that has taken some time to reach out and support. And also a reminder that you are amazing.
If you're if you're listening to this, hi, hi, I'm going to talk ignore Jay real quick. You're amazing. Your pain is valid. Your issues are valid. Any concerns that you have are completely valid. And hey, how about you go take care of yourself? I mean, yeah, I can you can listen to me.
I agree with all these things. No, that meant it like I'm ignoring Jay in this conversation right here. Not not that Jay was going to be saying bad things. I'm Jay and I don't know. I mean, not I have this message, of course. That's surprising that came out wrong, but that's fine.
No, not like you Jay. You know, just hanging out listening to you and James, you know, doing an amazing show and not sitting there throwing my own burdens on to it. I didn't talk about this before Kathy. Like I told you about this but I would I started going to therapy again, which is really great.
And now I'm not talking to Kathy talking to the rest of the people. the people. Hi. I actually have a really great situation in which for those that don't know because you can't tell for my voice, but I am a black male veteran with ADHD and some other things, which I'll talk about in a second.
 And I have a therapist who is a black male veteran with ADHD and some other things, which is like the first time that that's ever happened in my life is that I have a professional that not only understands kind of the diagnoses that I have, but then also like the cultural background and historical like baggage that comes with all of those things.
And I just want to say it is the most refreshing and like confirming and like or I guess affirming thing that I feel like I've had regarding my mental health in so long of a time. So absolutely incredible. I was so excited for you when I heard that.
And also to clarify and confirm black space male and male spent M spelled M-A-L-E not black male. All one word M-A-I-L. Kathy has dirt on me and prevents me from not ever not doing the show again. Right. I have to always show up or Kathy releases the Campbell cut.
I just like the first time you said it, I was like, wait, I know what this means, and yet my ears heard something different. So I wanted to make sure to clarify. Yeah. And I will use this as one of my follow up pieces. I have done a lot of talking about mental health in the last few months.
And I found out that apparently I want YouTube a lot talking about these things. I did a talking Atlanta while I was out in Georgia. And then I also was on ADHD online as well as ADHD nerds podcast. And there are videos of me doing all of those things.
And I, you know, if if you are considering getting an ADHD diagnosis and you want to know how it may or may not help you in the future or those things, then yeah, check out any of those videos. I'm sure we'll have links in the show notes there.
But also this past month, October was ADHD awareness months. I've been doing a lot in that space. And it's not to say that now it's November. I'm not going to be doing things. But it's been on my mind a lot. And I'm already excited for what I can take into next year to make that even better.
But yeah, there was that whole thing me being gone. And yeah, I gave my first keynote keynote for those that don't know is like when a big conference happens, they usually invite this speaker to come in and give a big talk that's supposed to kind of set the tone for the rest of the conference.
I got to do that with a friend of mine, the amazing Melanie Arbor shout out to her. We worked on this idea of, you know, the tech community that I belong to, being very similar to historically to public swimming pools in the United States.
And there's a lot of fun and excitement that comes with that. There's also a lot of historical baggage that comes with that and a lot of lessons learned. And ultimately, I, or I guess we made the the pitch that swimming pools are great, but they're even better when you have lifeguards on duty.
So let's, let's all volunteer to be a lifeguard from time to time. And it was a wonderful experience. One that I can't wait for the next time to happen. And yeah, that that was that was all the stuff that happened while I was gone apparently. Oh, yeah, absolutely amazing.
There was this other thing that happened, Kathy. But before we talk about it, I want to let people know that, hey, you can support all the fun stuff that we're doing by becoming a member at relay.fm slash conduit. And you can support the show by checking out youconwear.
com and purchasing stickers to decorate your space and remind you that you are a conductor. You have big conductor energy, the tire method. And of course, you can do it. Merge alert. And as a surprise, if you go, if you go to youconwear.com, you can also find some things that you can wear.
And these, we have a couple of shirts that we're going to be releasing by the time this show airs, they will be available. We have the conduit logo shirt, which is amazing because, you know, our conduit logo is is it pops out. And I've seen so good.
I've had people like see my phone and be like, whoa, what's that logo? That's really cool. Is that your brand? And I'm like, well, it's a show. And you should listen to it. You can listen to it.
But we also have some really good IMA conductor shirts that if you if you've seen the sticker that we have that IMA conductor sticker, it is definitely so cool to have that on a shirt. It is a wonderful iPlan on getting a couple for myself. We have plenty of colors to choose from.
And of course, a plethora of sizes. Yeah. And women's cuts and children as well as hoodies in the conduit logo aspect and tank tops as well. I like it. So yeah, again, go to youconwear.com. There'll be a link in the show notes there for that as well. Kathy, we've been talking a lot.
How do we do this last week? Let's find out in our connection check. Well, excuse me, you didn't zap. Oh, zap. Sorry, it's been so long since I've zapped. I didn't know what to do. Zap. Dacen's last zapping. Oh goodness.
Well, the last conduit span, I have a red X because I did not even start my business budget. I know. It's been a heck of a fortnight. So I feel like I keep saying that and I'm trying my best to reframe some things in my brain. We'll see how it goes. That's all I'm going to say.
Well, I mean, I want to check in on you there. You mentioned reframing. I mean, definitely, definitely the red X there on not starting it. But I mean, if you've had such a wild ride of the last conduit, is that okay? Is it fine? It didn't get started. Yes and no.
It really is something that needs to happen. And it's not even that I have been overly busy. I've got some like big projects that are going and some exciting things that are happening in my business. But it's been a weird brain fortnight. And so working on being kind to myself and to my brain.
So that's what I mean by that reframing. Trying to not be like, oh my gosh, I'm such a jerk. I'm such a like, you know, being nice to myself. And also trying to remind myself of all the things that I have done, which is good.
Like just because I didn't do this one thing doesn't mean I'm a failure by any means. And so just trying to, I may need to adjust my meds. I love the insight that comes from just processing all of that. But I mean, yeah, that's so tough.
I'm sorry that all these things have been happening and that, you know, you, I'm at least happy that you are aware of all of these things as they're happening and that you're like, well, how do we, how do we get out of that?
That is, that is something that I've been struggling with myself in trying to, to figure out is, you know, how do, how do I? And I mean, this is, this even connects with, with my connection as well.
So I will just go ahead and say mine like mine was to DFG and DFN to projects. I've made those up. DFG is done for good and DFN is done for now. I wanted to done for good two projects and done for now one.
I, I basically caught myself in a situation where it's like, I feel like I'm doing so many things that I needed to put a button on some stuff. And, you know, to, to be honest, I, I feel like I'm middle of the road at this.
Like, I, the thing that I'd done for good was the thing that was do that week. So like, of course, it was done for good because it's done. I did it and it's done, which is great because that's a lot of weight off of my shoulders.
But then there was also like some stuff that I said I was going to put a button on that I come, I like, I did one and didn't do the other.
So, you know, I'm, I'm still struggling and I recognize that I'm still struggling to give up some of the projects that I have to make room, not even room for more projects, but like room for like the current projects that I have. Yeah.
But yeah, like, and I want us to revisit kind of the DFG DFN stuff later, but that's for another episode.
 I think, you know, right now, I feel like we're both in a space where, you know, we'll talk about it later where we need to, we need to make room, but I think we need to make room for some, you know, mental affirming things, some fun things, but also get us through the, the rest of the process that we're in, and the funk that we're in, I guess.
What about our conductors? Yeah, our conductors have been busy. We're going to start off with Kate who created the, I think we're calling it like a semi conduct conduit, half conduit, demi conduit, something like that.
Kate basically came in and they gave us ultimately two connections, but also like, I'm just going to go for it. So the first week, they put half conduit connection check green check mark, finished my CV and launched the changes to my website.
Also made significant progress on sorting and my room feels much less of a mess and then gave my connection for the next half conduit is to get the spreadsheet sorted out for my job search and start the research. So the connection check for that one is the second half conduit.
Also, green circle got the spreadsheet sorted with many, many columns and conditional highlighting and have just started the research. So great job, Kate, getting things done in weekly half conduit sections.
Our soprano of the show, Deb O says green check mark got the old dressers out of the house by paying someone to deal with it so that we wouldn't injure ourselves. Also, make good progress on figuring out my new responsibilities at work. Awesome. Congratulations.
And I'm glad that when we have the privilege to pay someone to solve the problem, sometimes it's good to remember that you're not just solving the problem, but you're also preventing all of the angst and anxiety of letting that thing just sit there and linger.
So good job of just making the decision to let it be someone else's problem and taking care of it. Yeah, exactly. All right. Our favorite blue dragon has a green tree and a blue heart.
As of this morning, I impact prepared and despite what is norm on my travel days, I have actually eaten breakfast to Orlando. I go for my first academic conference. I'm so excited to hear how it goes. Good luck, Skye.
Our slot of the show, Ankenu says green check mark while I didn't do as thorough of a job as I intentionally intended.
I made big strides in cleaning or clearing surfaces and tidying up my office and hobby space and getting most things where they needed to be and decluttering a bunch of stuff I didn't need to hold on to. I'm inclined to lean a little yellow, but no, this is just green.
Hey, it sounds like you did the thing, but also maybe it can be a continuing thing that you do and you can keep getting all those greens little by little. Yeah, exactly. All right, James, connection check, our panda of the show shipped all of the things.
All my app updates are out and I did more than I thought I could, but still didn't overdo things at least not too much. You know what? We'll take it and especially recognizing when you are doing too much and working towards getting better at not doing all of the things.
And then our Oracle of the show, so says green apple achievement unlocked new house. We have successfully moved now to finish unpacking.
Congratulations, so and also, uh, yeah, finish unpacking the longer you wait, ask ask people who whose connection checks have been to unpack after a year, the harder it is. Oops, I mean, I just need to throw everything away.
That'll fix it, right? All right, our pathologist of the show, Laura says connection check, green book doing okay with planning my last structured days. A physical monthly planner and highlights are currently featuring prominently in planning what needs to be worked on each day.
I also figured out that I like using Zotero for article management, but ended up hooking up my personal laptop to an external monitor at work so I can still use obsidian for my notes.
Whatever anyone might say using whatever works is what works and it sounds like you're figuring out how to make what needs to work work. So congratulations.
Yeah, um, I've, Kathy knows I've had some struggles in that planning and management space lately, but we'll save that for a systems check later. Um, our nameless of the show set, how can you be the nameless of the show, but have a name? Anyway, our nameless of the show name redacted.
So that's a great check mark. We are as packed as we can be to move into our house, though delays and materials have pushed back the move and date by three weeks. Ouch, that, that's hard.
And I know that that's been an ongoing challenge, um, just given all of supply constraints and things and the whole like housing market right now is a little wild, um, at least in the US.
And I'm sure that probably reflects in other parts of the world as well, but, uh, at least you're, at least you're doing everything that you can. So good job on that.
Again, our final connection check for this conduit comes from our train enthusiast of the show Dave connection check green square still got the QA job the duck has arrived. I got the job offer. Yeah, fantastic things in a row. Congratulations. All right.

Sweet and smooth dark chocolate and brown sugar sweetness are in front and center in this easy drinking coffee with the surprising and delightful note of rose throughout. And honestly, yeah, it's actually, it's really good.
I enjoyed this, this bag of coffee a lot and especially as I've kind of slowed down on my coffee drinking, not because of trade, but just because I felt like I was drinking too much caffeine.
It was easy for me to adjust my schedule of how often bags were coming in using that, the website that they have. So yeah, I am actually excited for the next batch of coffee, which I can tell you, will be common voice compass, which I'm not going to give the whole spiel on that one.

Our thanks to trade coffee for their support of the show and all of Relay FM. Thanks. So Kathy, are we silly? No. Do it say that. I mean, not at all. When I think of the business unicorn of the internet, silliness is not a thing. It's very serious. Only the most serious of unicornying around.
Absolutely. I definitely do not choose my products based on the silliness factor because that would be silly. I mean, okay. So obviously, yes, we are two very silly individuals in that one, we embrace the puns, we embrace the jokes. This is who we are as individuals.
But also, I think that one of the things that I would dare say have brought to our success talking about productivity and things is that we are one of the few folks out there that don't take it so serious. Yeah, it's exhausting to be serious in my mindset.
I can obviously, I'm not going to, I don't know, invite a clown to a funeral unless that's something that really vibes with the person. I don't know. We're not, we're not, we're not going to do a funeral. I don't know. I don't know. Funerals are. Yeah.
That's a, that's an AI generated piece of art that I need in my pocket. No, I don't need that. But there are moments to be serious. However, most everything can have a silly factor to it. Yeah.
And there's like that, that song, like on the brighter, look at the brighter side of life, which I think comes from like life of Brian, which that whole scene itself is very silly. That whole comedy troupe is, yeah. That whole group is very silly.
And I've even noticed, you know, speaking of Python, the programming community that I'm a part of, the language is named after Monte Python, like it's named after the tree, but it's not named after the animal. I never knew that. Yeah.
And they actually work to infuse a bit of silliness, or at least not so seriousness, you know, in case they're joking about things. The, you know, it's a part of what made the language so approachable in the beginning. And all that to say, I kind of forgot about that.
And in a lot of my journey personally has, has been focused on how do I become more serious about things until recently when I just kind of said, you know what, forget that, I'm going to embrace the silliness in me. Yeah. In 2021, I had a phrase that I would, I used it so many times.
And I would say have more fun in 2021. Because silliness helps alleviate some pressures and serious, like, weights in your brain.
And being able to remind myself to that it's okay to have fun with something and that adding silly things to what could be the most basic functionality can help get things done. And this includes like doing work and projects that might be more serious.
But if you do it, I don't know, using a fun rainbow colored keyboard with lights to make it silly, oh great. I have a friend who would have a spreadsheet tiara. So anytime she was working on a spreadsheet, she put on her tiara because it made her feel more fun and it would be silly.
And it was a way to kind of lighten the mode for spreadsheet time. Spreadsheet time. There is so many amazing content creators that I follow. And I'm now thinking of like Evan and Caitlin who are like this couple that do projects with resin and woodworking and things like that.
And it makes it so, it makes them very approachable and that they're very silly and the things that they're doing. Like they replace their keycaps with resin.
Like I have like speaking of secret keyboard club, if you know you know, there's like a person in our industry that I got to meet virtually that has a the painting of Squidward, like the really artsy painting of Squidward entirely made out of keycaps. And it is like the most millennial thing ever.
And it's always a topic of conversation. And it's like this whole idea of I can be serious. But also I want you to know that there's a silly side of me as well. So and that's kind of the other piece of that puzzle as well. It boldenbrash is the name of the painting. Thank you.
You know Robert in the chat. The thing that makes silliness so great is how it can be a conduit for lack of a better phrase to doing the more serious thing.
Kind of like you said, you know, putting on the silly tiara, you know, the spreadsheet tiara allows you to get into that mode, but also remember that it's not a big deal. And I I love that.
So I wanted to ask you, Kathy, what is the silly thing that you do to help prepare for the the the super serious test that's about to happen? Yeah. I think the biggest thing is the fact that my headphones have a unicorn horn. Yes. I I have pink with light up like the cup things over your ears.
They have kitty ears and a unicorn horn in the middle. And it's absolutely without a doubt.
 My best slash favorite purchase ever because it really helps solidify that the people that contact me to become a member of the unicorn herd are my clients because anytime I've had somebody I've had an intro call and believe me, I've had these before like this has happened even though my website is already showcasing all of the silliness factor.
I am prancing around in a unicorn onesie in and the majority of the photos on my website. So like it's it's laying it out there because I only want to talk to the people that I want to talk about talk to that will enjoy the silliness factor.
But if they get to an intro call and they don't like see my headset and immediately smile or giggle or make some sort of commentary on it, I have a feeling that they're not going to work out very well with me.
It's only happened a couple times but it definitely has happened and it's not a red flag necessarily because obviously I'm going to give everyone a chance. But it definitely recognizes that maybe we aren't going to be the best match in a business sense which is totally fine. I get it.
It's like if you are in an industry or if your business is very serious and steadfast and not boring necessarily but also boring, we're not going to work well together and that's okay because like it's fine. Find somebody that can have less silly and that's again totally fine.
But for me, I want full silly all the time. I love it. Can I can I share a thing that I do that isn't I mean I think it's silly but some people might be like okay, okay nerd. Yes please.
So I recently started journaling again and I don't look at it as journaling because if I look at it as journaling then that's just something that hasn't really worked for me in the past.
So instead I hand right blog posts to myself and this is the interesting part about this is that I sign each one with my fancy pen. So it's not even a letter. It's just like you're setting it up to have a journal of Jay Miller's like letters to himself put into the Smithsonian.
I mean it really is like this this moment of like things have happened like I had my last post was called a Weekend Alone part two even though there was no Weekend Alone part one.
 But it signifies that I had two weeks where you know for most of the Weekend I was alone in the house because you know my wife and my daughter went out and we're doing things and like I got very introspective on you know some of the feelings that I've you know gone through I've been trying to do more cognitive behavioral therapy so defining the emotion and explaining how it made me fill in all these other things and it's like this is a straight up blog post I could just type this in and like put it on my blog and then like publish it to the world but I'm not going to and at the end like it is absolutely signed in you know a fancy pen that I got from the pen boss himself in like the best like calligraphic signature that I can make and it's dated and the thing is since I've started doing that I have journaled at least three times a week for like the last like month and sometimes sometimes it's like you know more of like just note taking sometimes it is just an insight from you know what happened in that day sometimes it's it's wrapping up this this long project that I've been working on or beginning to think about the next project that I'm going to pick up but ultimately all it's doing is encouraging me to to get the stuff out of my head and yeah it's just been super helpful but but again like I get to the end and I'm like I think that's it okay let me go grab the fancy pen yeah big big swishes here we go best best swishes wow best swishes is hilarious and horrific at the same time is there is there any other thing that you think that you do that that injects some some fun into your your day-to-day oh goodness I'm trying to think maybe there maybe there's something that you'd like to do to inject some fun and these aren't connections I'm just I'm just saying that these are maybe there's a thing that you would like to do to inject some fun yeah I feel like I need to do more dust dance parties oh I've done them in the past when I was like feeling really stressed or like waited down and I would just turn blast some music and dance all uh um graze anatomy and I would always feel better after and I don't know why I stopped doing that and I probably should do that more often um I'm trying to think of something else that would be like good but my brain is just not following up super well but I definitely need to concentrate no not need I want to concentrate on finding even more silly things to add to my life that's awesome I I recently also made the commitment to uh create a dedicated silliness time um a co-worker of mine and I have had this idea of you know we're we're in the the corporatyspace with business this and synergy and all these other words that really mean nothing let's circle back and discuss the synergy exactly exactly um so one of the things that we did was you know we we want to have a way to express like we can we don't have to be drones when it comes to proof of concepts demos and like explaining things so we decided that we're going to get on our normal call that we have so not adding more work to it and then just getting on our regularly scheduled call live stream them and give ourselves permission to be as silly as possible and at the end of the day we're going to also throw in the caveat but it's for our work with a winky face on it and and we the funny thing is we've already like done this as a as a proof of concept of like we were we did this this recap of this event that happened and then at the very end you could tell that it was running long because we were starting to get sillier and sillier and we were talking about this this idea of these little badges that go on a website and someone showed us this resource that we can make our own and we were like what if we just made one that does nothing but tell you like how close you are to Wednesday like that's it it just anywhere in the world how close is it to Wednesday like two days away one day and it's like yeah let's just do it and yeah the thought is like oh it's going to take too long it's a waste of time and it's like no it took us 30 minutes and then it was done and then we had this proof of concept that when you go to it now it's like days until Wednesday one and wow the cool part about that is I over the weekend I was thinking about this and I go you know so we actually do other things like I have this show that records you know once a week every friday and we actually have to have a deadline for when submissions for that show is so why don't I actually use this to say hey the deadline is in you know this much time so then I took that thing that we made out of pure silliness and actually applied it into a thing that is very practical and and that that to me is like the whole reason why like I wanted to talk about this stuff was like being silly sometimes isn't just like it makes me feel better inside but it it removes some of the blockers into solving problems that you might have because at the time you're not really trying to solve the problem you're just trying to inject a little bit of fun into your day yeah I think the idea of how your brain can kind of think differently if you're just like oh this is for fun it kind of removes a little bit of that stress which also means that you are able to kind of blow in a different way so you're able to do things that oh if you were in you know a big meeting with people you wouldn't ever make a suggestion of a camp down to Wednesday but because you're like oh this would be funny ha ha ha like japes are great and having more of them in your life means that you will be able to have more fun and I am 100% all for that I am I am also for great japes not to be confused with the NFT product that I'm not in support of that one I don't even know what that is and I'm okay you know okay totally fine okay don't need to oh no those are those are board japes I mean no the other thing me too it probably tells us that we should start wrapping the show up but I know because we're silly right now but before we do that we have one more sponsor we'd like to think have you ever thought about starting your own business creating a brand sharing your wealth of knowledge with the world using your years of experience to create something for yourself or adding something silly to the world however wants to help you take the first step in getting your ideas off the ground if you have a brand that you've always dreamt of building or a business you want to take online the first step is finding your domain name however makes this super simple with a clear and straightforward user experience easy to use tools and truly amazing support from friendly humans it's never too late to step up to the plate and share what you have to offer getting online has helped thousands of people around the world reach new heights with their business uh jay do you have any domain names uh i don't like i'm gonna few um just a couple yeah let's see let's see what do we got here uh i'm sure my list isn't as long as yours um yeah i i think i have like six here including my own personal website kjy miller.

i know the ads over but i just want to throw out there that in the time and it took to read that ad i have forwarded jay mill or dot tech to my website.
 incredible absolutely incredible so uh kathy uh what are you gonna try to do for your connection yeah it's been like i mentioned at the start of the podcast it's been a heavy period of of time in the soup household um so i am going to concentrate on adding more silly to my daily routine and try a little silliness i think oh i'm just writing one set i love it yes do you have do you have like anything in particular that you're gonna do with it or i don't know but i i'm wondering if i might um i have those like le delights that you put on the top of your room like all of the tiktokers do.
 I have them and i never put them up because i thought i would paint my walls but i actually really like the white walls so i may just put them up and then i can maybe create some sort of fanciness um and make them dance when i have my dance party so i can have like a shortcut or something that reminds me to have a dance party so something like that might work.
That's awesome um i still don't know what i'm gonna do okay jay talks out his connection on the floor i part infinity um part 35.
 Exactly yeah the episode 35 35th time jay's tried to do this um so i i definitely do want to continue to do more silliness in my things um um that being said i do feel like there are a couple of things that i could have easily wrapped up that i didn't that would have made that yellow a green and the thing is they're all relatively simple things like i could set up a madoro or two and like just say i'm going to work on them for the next you know however many minutes and then wrap it up so i'm gonna do that i'm going to i'm going to wrap up the things that prevented my dfg dfn status and i will figure out a better way to word that um before next show i mean honestly the you can word it however you want because the connection is for you oh that's true wrap up the things that prevented dfn dfg okay and we're i'm gonna i'm gonna be hovering over those phrases for the next few conduits um obviously we mentioned before uh we're gonna have a guess uh during one of those um but hopefully when we get back maybe we'll we'll get to them uh a little bit more and talk about some of the process that went that took place but i also look at our calendar and it says that we have a systems check coming up so oh my goodness we're already almost at the end of another season yeah what is time what is time just title all the silliness what is time so yeah jay's gonna wrap up his stuff kathy's gonna add more silly things what about the conductors yeah our uh owl of the showcase their connection for the next half count conduit is to get the spreadsheet sorted out for their job search and start the research while still continuing the sorting of course our soprano the show debo says it's all about self-care for the next few weeks i love it i'm having surgery before the next conduit oh no i need to focus on rest recovery and letting my husband take care of me absolutely uh one thousand percent yes uh okay sorry uh i didn't mess up the spreadsheet but i kind of did but it's fine uh because the next the real next connection for kate was to continue the job research and sorting EA ongoing projects i would kate thus the demi conductors connection the demi conductor the demi connections clearly ruined my brain so i ruined this not you you did great i'm going to move on and we're gonna do sky our blue dragon that the shows next connection which is while at this conference they want to walk the fine line between being as much of an extrovert as possible and making connections without exhausting themselves too much i i don't know what type of conference it is so perhaps i can reach out to them and get more information but i well they are currently right the second flying to Orlando well awesome um wow dragons flying imagine that um but i would i would hope that they remember that of all of the tracks that are at conferences the mental health track is definitely one of them and uh take some time for themselves as well anyway the panda of the show uh says uh to also take a well-earned break this is this is self-care week i love it take a well-earned break i have nothing i have to do for work right now it's time to relax a bit and recharge the batteries um i'm glad that you're using rechargeable batteries because if a panda like opened its belly up and put new batteries in i would be very concerned um but also uh i don't want to know where that plugs in so good job i hope that you have a good recharging oh wow you made it silly j our oracle of the show self their new connection is i have november set aside for some writing projects i'd like to finish the guest blog i've been working on giraffe to book chapter and make progress on the journal journal article i'm writing it's totally doable if i don't get distracted with other things i mean distractions are part of life and i wish you all the best our pathologists of the show Laura says finishing planning and navigate a visit from my mom uh a weekend trip up to see my brother and my son's birthday party that sounds like a lot of celebrations happening aka prioritize planning some personal things which probably means working on these things in the evening um some when i'm usually pretty brain dead um yeah again make sure to to sprinkle in a little a little bit of silliness and a little bit of recharging um however you choose to do so in that area um for yourself in between them and and if you know that the evenings aren't going to be a great time for you then force force inject them other places be like no it is pause slash dance slash recharge break and and make them happen when they need to happen not just when you don't have the energy left to even do it yeah and uh Laura talked about that connection in the live stream chat which you can hang out in the discord with us we record this live every other Tuesday at uh 12 o'clock specific time is when we start we have some pre-show post show all sorts of goodies uh but they said that they should make that a connection for near the end of november after the craziness that will be mentioned in her connection so clearly self-care is on the horizon for Laura uh our nameless of the show Robert's new connection plan the major things that i need to get done in the next two months the holidays and other events take more time than i'm mentally a lot for and i have three major projects that need to be completed by the beginning of January take a day to think about my new theme while i continue with the year of suits or as a time for a new theme i mean you can always change your theme whenever you want uh that is a valid tool uh and it sounds like you've got a lot going on uh so yeah maybe taking some time to to see about your theme um could be really helpful to kind of adjust um where you're at now and finally our train enthusiasts of the show um we still have the Halloween names yes Dave says try and look at how to better focus while at home maybe it's the duck of focus maybe it's something else um i i love the duck of focus um yeah i today i have a a homer coffee cup that has smiling homer and doe homer um and depending on whether or not i've done a good thing i turn it to
