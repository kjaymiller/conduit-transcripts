From RelayFM, you're listening to Conduit, the show where we condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that doesn't want you to have us confirm three times for the same thing.
This week is brought to you, this episode is brought to you by the letter T for Tuesday or Thursday when you're hearing this. Oh, hey. But nothing else. I'm Jay, staff product advocate at Ivan, and with me is the internet's busy-ness unicorn, Kathy Campbell. Hi, Kathy. Hi, Jay.
I was going to say I miss you, but TIFF was pretty great. I know. I know. Yeah, I was gallivanting across Riga, Latvia, having fun eating at Michelin restaurants. It was fantastic, honestly. Amazing. Oh, my goodness. It's everything I ever wanted, and I miss it all the time.
We're going to talk more about that. We're going to talk about that in the post-show, all the things I liked, didn't like. There's very little that I didn't like. Anyway, this week, Kathy in the Discord, what happened? Yeah, it's November now, which means we have a forum.
We're doing something a little bit different for the spotlight this year. So every month I do, I interview one of our hosts or other members of the Relay community, like editors and whatnot. And I ask them anything that is sent in by our Discord members.
And this month for Spotlight, we are going to be we're asking for submissions on what our community is thankful for. So if you are a member of the Discord, fill out the form. We would love to hear what you are thankful for. And then I will read it on the show. So I'm excited for it.
We'll see how it goes. And thank you in advance for saying that you're thankful for Conduit. We absolutely appreciate you. And we are thankful of you as well. Thanks.
What about in the co-working session that we definitely had this time for sure for Reels that you showed up for? Yeah, we did have one for real and I did show up for it if I remember correctly. The good thing I took notes to say what we did.
It's a great thing that you took notes because I feel like it was such a blur. But anyway, we we talked about what it was like to podcast. We talked about why we don't record our show with the video on. For those that don't know, the answer is Kathy. And yeah, 100 percent. And that's OK.
And then we talked about whether or not it's OK to send your child through the mail. The answer might surprise you or not, because, you know, we used to do a bunch of horrible things in our past and not in our past, but in like the past of humankind.
And for the record, yes, you could mail your children for a period of I think it was like eight years in the early 20th century when the Postal Service was new. I was like the early 20th century. My brain got messed up. I was like, yeah, I was like 11. And I was like, no, no, no.
That's 21st century. Wrong one. But yeah, if any of that sounds fun. Also, I managed to get some stuff done. So if any of it sounds like fun doing work while talking about podcasting video and mailing your child, become a superconductor today.
You'll get access to that, plus you'll get access to the pre and post show of the show with no sponsor read that we would normally have. Hey, Kathy, what's your one good thing? I am so excited that it is now a slipper season.
I have some incredible Ugg slippers that I get new inserts for every year because stinky feet. And it's pretty, pretty great to be able to wake up. I do have to go into my closet to get my slippers because otherwise someone named Ophelia would eat them. And that's not great.
So but I really like walking around in my slippers. They're nice and toasty and comfortable. That's awesome. What's yours? My lips stopped tingling, which is. Yay. There was some slight concern there. Lips had some numbness for like about a day. I was like, huh, don't know what that's about.
But oh, well. And then, yeah, today I feel much better about that. So, yay. Incredible. Also, I went pickleballing. I played some pickleball. Are you a pickleballer? Do you pickleball? No, I don't. I don't do sports balls. You know, the one Brad Dowdy is like a super legit pickleballer. Yeah.
Well, that makes sense because Mr. Brad Dowdy also was like a semi-professional golf person. So like pickleball kind of tracks. Yeah. It's yeah. It's I was I was surprised. He was talking the last time I hung out with him. He was like, yeah, we did pickleball like three times a week.
And I was like, oh, doesn't sound like me. Yeah. I don't know how you schedule that. Like, how do you do anything three times a week? I mean, that's just commitment to the game right there. You make it a part of your daily routine. That's true. But but yeah, enough about that.
Let's jump into the connection check. I don't know. I love how the zap we went from always a zap to an automated zap to no zap to now a sometimes zap, sometimes other sounds. Yeah. Listen, I'm just I'm just living my best life right now as best I can. Well, your best life.
Does that involve a routine at all? It does. So I have a big green checkmark for my connection check, which was a morning routine for both my projects. That's basically both lives that I live as work, two different desks, two different computers.
And let me tell you, switching between command and control for like copy and pasting and things is really messing with my head. It's scary how quickly I transition over.
But I have been kind of stabilizing what time each day that I do each work, which has, I think, really helped solidify kind of how I get the stuff done. And I'm finally starting to feel settled into what the heck I'm doing. So we love that.
I mean, you could also just change your keyboard to a no paste the control C the copy and stuff, right? I don't know. On Mac. I think you can. Oh, no, no, no, no. I don't want to change it on my Mac. Oh, OK. Because I use like. Yeah. So I know I'm just living. Listen, I'm just living my life.
It's fine. It's fine. What about you? Um, I was supposed to be getting back into my Hobonichi. Um, I had gone to New York and I went to one of the like places you go to when you're a pen person and you're in New York. And that is Yoseka Stationery in Brooklyn, where I saw a picture of Brad Dowdy.
Um, this is a secret Brad Dowdy episode. Spoiler. Every episode is a secret. We love Brad Dowdy episode. I love it. Um, but I also got to hang out with some friends who are very much into their Hobonichis and using it every day. And I was so jealous and I was like, oh, it's just sitting.
It's over there collecting dust, doing nothing. And I still got it like a good like 50 pages to use for the rest of the year. And I was like, you know what? I, I should just, I should, I need to go back to it. And, uh, we've got a connection check coming up, not connection check, a systems check.
Um, we have a systems check coming up and I was like, man, it would be weird to, to just be like, oh yeah. Systems check. No more, no more analog productivity for this, for this person. Like, yeah. But no, I'm, I'm using it again. To be honest, I didn't know what my connection was.
So when I went back to the last episode or the episode before last, and it said, get back to writing in my Hobonichi. I was like, oh cool. I've been doing this for the last like week. Um, and I didn't even realize why. So I was like, I did it. Awesome. Amazing. I'm still doing it.
Um, that said, what about our connectors? Yeah. Carl of all trades of the show. Carl got his connection check in super early, which we love. Whatever you need to do. Um, his connection check, green typewriter.
My friend had a wonderful trip down to see me and even brought me three typewriters to go with the. And I'm guessing analog synthesizer, not analogy synthesizer, but I make no assumptions. Now I want to know if an analogy synthesizer is the thing. Possibly. Uh, no, it just says analog synthesizer.
Um, awesome. Our checklist enthusiasts of the show, Mike says, yellow heart, clean out my office. I cleaned up most of my office and I'll get the rest done this week. I love that.
You're like, again, how do you, how do you like prioritize those things for future time? Um, that is, that is an episode in itself and that I would be not very helpful because the second I say I will do this later, it's out of my head. Yeah. Yeah, totally.
The, uh, of the show, uh, says green heart. I did get my Halloween costume sorted well ahead of time. Unfortunately, I didn't wear it anywhere, but now I'm ready super early for next year. We love that positive thinking. That's wild.
Um, our tech podcast listener of the show, Pelix said, I did the thing. I started working on redacted and, uh, project for awesome people in the discord. Oh, that's, I mean, again, like I'm glad that you're, you're making progress. Yes. The profane sleeper of the show.
Mike says connection check yellow circle emoji. The missus has started her treatments this week and has visited with her speech therapist and her dietitian in the last couple of days. I've also tried getting back into my normal routine with varying degrees of success.
Also with road construction, getting in the way of my normal route to walk. The route is the only safe one around our apartment. You know what? Like finding, finding those little wins. That's great. Yeah.
 Um, our robotics engineer of the show, Aiden, who I was totally texting and talking to, um, um, while we were, while we were watching the world series, uh, thank you for making my world series that much brighter, even though the blue Jays lost and the Dodgers won, which I was not happy about, but that's fine.
Um, anyway, uh, it said yellow square. The table has been chopped up and the pieces are more or less ready, but it turns out I'm missing what I need to finally put it all together. Uh, well, one trip to home Depot, get you squared right up. Yep. Yep. Our identical twin of the show.
Aaron says connection check green circle had plenty of relaxation time, which worked out as well for my connection check. Given that I'm feeling under the weather the past week, watching the world series was less relaxing, but was quite fun.
Uh, and Aaron also apologized for bringing up more sports ball to which I said, that's okay. We like, even, uh, even I, in my non sports ball world knew what was going on. So that's fun. And our Esperano knitter of the show. Iris on yo says, uh, yellow square.
I kind of finished my Esperanto theory slash dictionary for steno, and I'm trying it out and making some changes. Typing is slow for both English and Esperanto. Um, but I'm keep trying not for this message. It's still a bit too much.
Um, last two weeks were busy and stressful and did eat chocolate, but did not gain weight. Hence the yellow. I, I, I'm going to say, okay. Um, that's a lot. Um, that, that's a lot that you were able to get done, even if things didn't necessarily turn out all the ways that you wanted them to. Yeah.
And I would almost say that it should be a green because you did the things that you had control over and other things you don't have control over. And the things that you don't have control over shouldn't necessarily, um, limit your success.
Uh, is that a thought? Do you think otherwise? No, I was just saying, hmm. That tracks. Okay. Okay. Our soprano of the show, Debo, says, connection check. Green heart. Successfully planned meals and fed my parents on their visit. Yes. We love feeding people. Well done. I was going to say yes.
Making sure that your parents were fed is good. Um, our chief, our chief Swifty of the show, Andrew says, uh, check Mark. I have created most of the basic landing sites for my business. It's a long way to go, but it's a start, you know, as I, as I yawn there because I had some good new Haven pizza.
If you were listening in the pre-show, you know, um, the, the, like long, the long stretch of getting your business website up and running in the year 2025 feels very much like your business website is probably not the most important thing.
Like all of the other pieces that go with it, like having the, the website there is definitely important. And especially if it's like how you manage, like getting clients and stuff, but then like all the social media stuff is almost as equally important. Yeah.
And Andrew didn't talk about social media or anything. We're celebrating the fact that he got the landing sites for the business and they're up there and that's all that matters. A hundred percent.
More, more of what I'm saying is like the fact, like don't, don't necessarily stress about the, like, it's got a long way to go part because like the landing site for the business is like having one is a big check. And it's a big check that like a lot of other companies probably don't even have.
So like, yes, you already stand out. Yes. Good point. Our Oracle of the show. So says connection check green apple found a local church, went to church. It was great. And everyone was so sweet. And I may go back. Well done. Yay. I'm so excited for you.
Uh, and then our nameless of the show nameless says green circle. I talked with my manager about getting some certifications that would help me in pushing this project further along and help me understand why the tools that were picked, um, for this project were picked. I'm also working away.
I'm also working away at getting the curriculum set up. I think I'm, I think that having it ready further in advance will also open more teaching opportunities for some of the people I've been mentoring to teach. That's, that's interesting.
Like I, I like that approach of like, Hey, maybe I should get some certifications and that would help me understand better why certain decisions were made.
I have, I've not thought about the idea of certification in that aspect, um, before, but I do know of people who have been like, you should take such blah, blah course. And it would help you understand this process that we use at work. Um, I have never had the ability to do that, but interesting.
I was again, it's, it's just a thing that I don't think about that often. So I'm, I'm kind of intrigued by that, that mindset. Yeah, for sure. I apologize, uh, to anyone listening.
If you hear some weird noises in my audio, I currently have two cats that are very desperate to help me podcasts right now. Um, and they keep rubbing against the microphone and every time I push them away, they come back. So I'm sorry. Don't throw your cats.
Hey, this episode of conduit is brought to you by the amazing folks that support conduit, uh, on a regular basis. Um, it is November.
 I don't know if we don't, we don't have the ad read for it yet, but I can tell you that this is usually the year where we are thankful for those people who maybe have a little bit more or a little bit less, but they decide to spend it on conduit because this is the time where you can gift a, uh, a membership.
Again, I'm not going to talk about that right now because I think that's going to be in the next episode. Um, but all of those people who sponsor us throughout the year, whether you're doing a monthly or you're doing an annual, like I just, just know that it's a, it's appreciative.
Um, for many reasons, I actually was able to use a little bit of that money this time around, uh, I guess from last month to, uh, donate to a food bank.
 Uh, because again, right now, not everybody has the same access to food, uh, that they might usually have in the U S so thinking about that, thinking about some of the travel that I've made, thinking about some of the extra decisions that I I've made, like I'm going to an unconference for the first time.
And a part of the way that I'm able to pay for that and get to hang out with some people who I will tell you about after it happens.
Cause I don't know how much I'm supposed to talk to talk about it, but I'm going to be hanging out with some cool people, um, in a few weeks and not being on this, on this podcast. Yeah. Less excited about that. Yeah. Let me tell you.
Um, but I will say like my hotel was covered through, you know, some of the money that I've saved up just from doing this show. So it, I, it, it does actually mean a lot to me that y'all were, that y'all support this show, um, that y'all are in the discord chatting.
Um, I've, I've said it time and time again, I did a show for several years and the only thing that I wanted were people to actually engage with the content and like, share their opinion, share their thoughts.
Um, that is why I, you know, I am, I'm a firm believer in our connection checks and all those things. I think it's just another great way to connect with, with the audience here. Um, so yeah, all of those people that donate Kathy, you were, you were saying something. I'm sorry.
Yeah, no, I was going to say that. I also, I took the money this month, um, that we made, which for the record, it's not a ton. We're so thankful for every penny that we do get. I just want to put that out there.
Um, and I took that amount and I doubled it and I sent it to our local, um, food bank as well. We have one that, um, is produced like hyper locally. Um, it's not a big company that does it. It's just like a bunch of smaller people coming together and, and processing it.
 And I'm so thankful that our community has that as well as a few, um, local, like donation spots, like a, like a little free library, but for food and supplies and stuff and, um, being able to send some money to them, um, that I'm just, I'm just so thankful that I'm in that position to be able to do that.
Especially having lived on food stamps before, uh, when Ryan was going through, uh, when Mr. Soup was going through the stroke and we were trying to balance my work with, you know, taking care of people and survival and all of that.
We were on food stamps for a couple of years and I'm so thankful that that option was available and everyone deserves, uh, food. And I hate that that is a fairly political statement. Yeah. Um, and again, like we're, we're happy that the people that support us do support us.
And I mean, this little glimpse into what that money goes to, I mean, I'm not going to lie. Sometimes it goes to dinner. Um, sometimes it goes to, you know, a thing that I wanted, uh, a few months ago, it went towards a new phone.
Like there, there are, there are very, there are very different reasons why we do what we do and money is a part of that, but it's not the whole part. Um, but we, we thought that, you know, it's important for y'all to know that we do think y'all and that right now it kind of sucks.
Uh, there's a lot of reasons that things suck. Um, but if, if you wanted to know more about the people that you're supporting, um, you, you just got a small glimpse of that, um, just in this little ad read.
So again, thank you to all the people that do support our super conductors that are, that are here with us that are hanging out in the discord. Um, if you want to become a super conductor yourself, um, because those super conductors won't hear this cause they don't get the sponsor reads.
Um, maybe they'll get this one. Um, yeah. Um, but then, uh, yeah, if you, if you want to support us, you can, again, you get the pre-show and the post-show and you don't normally get the sponsor reads.
Um, but, uh, you also get access to the coworking and you get access to a really fun and delightful discord that is well moderated.
Um, and there are really, really awesome people in that to not just for conduit, but for all of the shows in the relay, um, in ecosystem, I would say, uh, cause some of those shows include shows that are not on relay.
And, um, I mean, if you want to talk about pins, uh, if you want to talk about tech, if you want to talk about development, if you want to talk about productivity, if you just want to talk about Taylor Swift or sports or popular culture, like there's something for everyone, um, in our discord.
Uh, but yet you can get all that information at I'm a super conductor.com that's letter I letter M letter a super conductor.com and become a member today. And once again, a thank you to all of those who support us. Yes. Thanks.
Hey, Kathy, if you had to do something in the next like minute and a half, how would you do it in the most productive way? Uh, it would depend on the thing. Oh, it would depend. It would depend on the thing. That's, that's probably really depend on the thing. Yeah.
I mean, honestly, if I had a minute and a half, I would just probably do it. Yeah. Yeah.
But again, it depends, it depends on how long is this thing? Like how long does it take to do the thing? What sort of preparation? And, and this is, so this is kind of our topic, um, uh, productivity, fast and slow. Thinking both kinds. Fast productivity and slow productivity. Yep. Yep, exactly.
We're definitely not pulling from a popular book. That's one. Listen, if you do not listen to if books could kill, what are you even doing with your life? Um, it, and, and before, and I'm going, I am going to preface this by saying adding another podcast with two white dudes.
Yes, I can see extremely problematic. However, what they have to say is important. Oh my gosh. Icarus, why are you, why are you doing this? Why are you, why are you? I have, I have a dissenting opinion. Yeah. You do not need to add another podcast with white people. Yeah.
Um, so if there, listen, I, yeah, I am, I'm doing my best not to add, um, podcasts to my feed that are not by some sort of minority, um, group. And yet this is one that is really, it's really great. And it fits our kind of premise in the same way.
It talks about how, um, all of these self-help books out there just really are the same thing. And it's a cash grab. It, they take information that could be a blog post and try and, and publish a book. Um, and, uh, it's, it's a great, it's a great, uh, podcast.
But that being said, um, you know, we, we love, we love productivity here. Um, and we like real productivity.
And I had a thought when I was walking the dog on Sunday, actually about talking about, um, the different kinds of productivity in the sense that sometimes it's fast and sometimes it's slow and both kinds are correct. Yeah. Yeah.
It, it's interesting when we talk about the, the individual pieces of being productive, like you talk about your, the tire stuff, which tire stands for your time, your intuition, your resources, and your energy.
But even some of the like tangible productivity steps of like writing things down, coming up with a game plan and, or, you know, putting them in your app and putting them in your long term app or your, your, what's it called? Your later, later page or whatever.
Um, and the GTD trademark people will, will know. Yeah. I don't know. Um, or your someday maybe list. That's what it is.
Um, but like having, having like all of those steps and that's great and all, but what happens when you like, there just isn't time for all that, like, or, or is there time for that?
I don't know the, like, that's, that's kind of the question that I, you know, when Kathy had mentioned like slow productivity, I was thinking like fast productivity of, yeah, but how do I, what's value do I get from writing something down when I got to do it like right now? Yeah.
Yeah. And I think, I think this comes down to there's, I think it might be a GTD thing of like, if it takes you less than five minutes, just do the thing. Um, hard to disagree on that, by the way.
Oh, well, I listen, I'm there, there are many things, many thoughts that I have on a variety of different things. Um, but one of the things, uh, is that this does not work for me because of my ADHD. Yeah.
I need to, well, partially I really enjoy like the joy of being able to check something off my to-do list. Like that's a little, just a little dash of serotonin there that I enjoy.
Um, but also this thing that takes less than five minutes, is it actually a priority? Is this something that I need to do right now? Or is it something that I'm doing now because I don't want to do something else? Yes. I, and go ahead.
I, I, I have to write down like the thing that's going to take like a minute to do. I have to write it down because not because of its sake, but everything that's going to come after it. Cause I will take, I will feel time based on what I have to do. If it's going to take me. Oh my gosh. Yes. Yeah.
If it takes me like two minutes to do a thing, but I've got like 10 minutes, it's probably going to take me 10 minutes to do it. So I, I have to like write down like thing one, thing two, thing three.
That way I allocate the time specifically like, okay, I need to hurry up and get this done so that I can get to the next thing. Yes. Uh, there's also like this idea that if I'm, so I am actually the most productive when I have the most meetings in place.
And that's not because I will do all of the stuff on those meetings. It's because I only have, you know, an hour or two hours in between meetings, sometimes 15 minutes. And I still have stuff that has to get done, which means I will do that quick as opposed to not.
So it's a lot of it is a brain game of what works for you. And sometimes that's doing stuff fast. And sometimes that's doing stuff slow. And I say slow knowing that like the thing itself might take time or more time or less time or something similar.
But the important part is kind of like what preparation you are doing for this.
Um, and, and one of the things that I've really noticed lately is that if I take time in the morning before I do anything to sit down and actually write what's on my list to do or what needs to happen or any of that, then I'm so much more successful. Yeah. And it's ridiculous how easy that is.
I think with like the slow productivity, it always feels like fast productivity for me feels like I'm, I should be trying to slow it down. And then slow productivity feels like I should be trying to defer and delete as much as possible to really like prioritize.
Like, I think that's, that's the challenge of like, if it's fast, there is the, like, I could just do this.
And, and one of the things that I will say that I've gotten better at is, is with like this year with black Python devs, having a two other people that basically had the exact same authority as me.
Um, even though like they reported to me in terms of the structure, like their word when they sent out an email was just as valuable as if I had said it, it meant that things that I would normally have on my plate, I had the ability to go slow this down. This really needs to go through this person.
And if it can't be slowed down to go to that person, then the answer is going to be no. Um, yes.
And I think that like that limits the quote unquote fast productivity to things that don't take a long time or sorry, that limits, that limits the fast productivity to things that don't take a long time versus things that are quote unquote urgent that are not really urgent.
They're just, they're just someone wants them quickly and it doesn't take a long time. Therefore now you're like, Oh, well, let me just go ahead and do it really quick. And you're actually giving up an opportunity to pass something to take something off of your plate completely. Yes. Yeah.
There there's also this idea. Soph made a comment in the live stream chat about stacking small tasks at the moment and doing them all at once. And this is something that I strongly believe in. It's something that works super well for me. The hard thing is, is when these things don't take. Okay.
For example, for example, um, I am doing support for relay emails. We don't get a whole lot of support. Like there's not, there's not a ton of, of things in there. Um, for the most part, it takes maybe two minutes to answer an email.
However, in that I have to go and I have to like click the button to start tracking the time so that I get paid for doing the work that I'm doing. And that's, that's a lot of work. It's ridiculous. So I will wait. And see if anything else comes in. And usually it doesn't.
So by the end of the day, I'm like, fine, I need to like get back to this. Um, and it's frustrating that my brain is like, Nope, I can't answer this right now. I can't switch. Uh, and it also, I hate that my brain is like. You can't leave these emails here because I hate unread emails. I hate them.
It, it, like notifications are horrifying to me. I need to get things done with them. Um, and yet here I sit and I have an un, one unread email from, let me look. Oh goodness. From the first of October. So more than a month now of a task that I need to do that.
I haven't transferred the tasks because it's not going to take a ton of time, but it's going to be finicky and I have to do it and I don't want to do it, but I need to. And so maybe that's going to be my connection because it's not good.
Again, it's not going to take a lot to do, but I don't want to do it. So, yeah. Yeah. It's, it's interesting in that, um, my brain just like gave up on all of it. Yeah. Um, the, the mountain, like you talk about like the task feeling like a mountain and like they don't get done in forever.
Like how that's, that's what Soph wrote. The problem that I struggle with in that is seeing, what is it like seeing the forest from the trees? Yeah. Um, just, just in the spirit of being a developer.
I think I've talked about this anecdote before where like I worked on a team and it was like, I couldn't see the entire picture of what I was doing. And it gave me like this fog of, of uncertainty of just not knowing, like, am I doing a good job? The fog of war. The fog.
I mean, there was no war involved. It was. No, but that's what they call the fog in like civilization. The game. Oh yeah. Yeah. And I mean like, even, even in the military, like fog of war is totally a thing in the way that you get through fog of war is having clear instructions.
Like that, that is the thing that we were, we're taught in training is like, you're constantly being asked, what were your instructions? You're constantly being asked, like, what do you do in a certain situation? Like preparation helps eliminate fog of war.
And with me, like, again, this is where I go into the, like, if I have a bunch of small tasks that I'm supposed to do, like I have like two or three videos that I'm trying to make this, this, you know, week. And they're all, they're all like minute, minute and a half videos.
And the idea is like, this isn't a, this isn't a small task. Like I've learned quickly that like a minute and a half video still takes three hours to edit and publish and do like all this stuff.
And honestly, coming up with a good minute and a half video can take all day because you have to like work on a script and you have to work on the different recording pieces and all those things.
So it's like, that's not a small task, but there might be a smaller task of just writing the description for it. I will, if I don't have a clear cut, like full idea of what we're doing, coming up with that really small task of writing that description will take me all day.
Um, even when like Kathy, um, we, we talked about this before. Kathy says like, you know, Jay, I need a title and a description for the show.
A lot of that is often me going like, okay, I could just reply back immediately, but there's a part of me that has to stop and sit there and think and go like, what did we talk about? Um, yeah, what happened? That was two whole days ago. I've had breakfast in between then and now.
Um, so like it's, it's hard to not have clear cut instructions to where coming in and doing this show, the, the best decision we ever made was having a show notes template.
Mm-hmm because like now the process is there's still steps that we have to do in getting our show ready, but like the template itself answers all the questions. Who's weak is it? Like that was the thing that we added at the very end.
Like that's one of the more recent additions of like, who's weak is it? Um, who, whose connection was what, you know, what are all the things like add, add all the pieces, it even has like a little checklist. If we're ever confused on what we need to do within our notes.
And that goes before the show and after the show, like our pre-flight, make a new template, add the sponsor texts, copy the connections, fill out the show notes. Who's weak is it? What do we do in the pre-show? What are we doing in the post-show? And then like, now we can start the show.
If I had to try to think about all of those things individually, without it being written down, it would slow down the process of doing the show. Um, and in fact, like the fact that it does speed up the process, it actually allows us to do a pre-show while we're doing these things.
So like that's, that's the little inside, inside baseball into how our show runs is there's usually a topic that is brought and we talk about that topic so that it gives us time to do all the pre-flight stuff and then the post-show stuff.
And who does all of that pre-flight stuff? I mean, Hey, granted when you're not here, I do. Yes. Yes. I've just, listen, I'm just, I'm just calling it like it is.
But the nice thing about that is that I can come in and quickly check all of the stuff and be like, okay, did we do that? Did we do that? Did we do that? Oh, Kathy did everything. Amazing.
And if there was something that was missed, like I could be like, oh, I'm going to go and do this really quick. Um, or I'll help with the connection checks if I'm not distracted by words coming out of my mouth.
Um, but it's, it's so interesting that like, I would call this a fast productivity thing. Get ready for the show. Like that's, that's a fast productivity thing. The only reason it is, it can be fast is because we took the time before to make it fast. Yes.
And, and I think that's where I'm, I'm really interested in the idea of like the slow side of productivity, which is the, I've done this thing or I have to do this thing.
How do I go about strategizing in order to do that thing? And whether it's delegation, whether it's planning, whether it's coordinating or meeting or whatever. Yeah. And I will say slow is something that I actually have a really hard time with. Um, I really, I want to be a deep planner.
Like I wish I could sit and be like, Hey, I'm going to sit and, and, and do this thing. Um, let me spend some time, you know, the people that do a gray holiday gravecation is what it's called. Sorry. You're not a, yeah.
Where, you know, they go away to a place and talk, you know, do the stuff and just sit there and, and do the thing. And I, my brain doesn't work very well for that kind of planning or like sitting in and processing a whole project from beginning to end.
Um, and I wish that it did, but it doesn't for me and that's okay. So instead I can do these minor things, um, to process what I can do, what I do do, what works for me. And that, yeah, that's, that's how it's, how it rolls. Um, that's how my life rolls. That's how I do my stuff.
And, uh, I'm okay with that. I just need to learn how to do it the best, you know? Yeah. Well, and, and I think it's going to be different for everyone. Um, great, great patients are, uh, I, I get so bored and, and Kathy, I'd tell you like boredom is the absolute enemy of my productivity.
Um, it has, it has zero to do with like the amount of the task, the complexity of the task.
It has everything to do with how bored am I in the midst of doing this? Um, and I, I think that it's, it's like, anytime I think of like a slow, like a slow productivity task is, is usually defined by there are literal dates that I cannot speed up. I can't speed up time.
Like I'm, I'm doing a live stream everybody on the 20th of November. And like, there is so much planning going into this because it's going to be the first of like a series of them that I do. And I can't speed that process up because I can't fast forward time.
So there's, there's a lot of like, well, where do we talk to marketing about the marketing things and where do we do the, the blah, blah, blah. And it's like, oh, I've got to get NDAs for people. And like, there's like all this stuff and it's, it's very much like, okay, I've done some work.
Can I stop like doing, doing the work now because I have to fill, I need to fill out that time. If I do everything right now and I rush, like it's all being done tomorrow, I'm going to be upset. And then there's going to be a bunch of downtime in which I'm bored and then it's going to be horrible.
So it's like, do a little bit of work, create an email template. I'll send that email template out tomorrow because it's election day and I'm off for the second half of the day. And like, when I send, I'm going to be like, all right, well, I'm going to send those emails off.
What's the next thing that needs to happen? Oh, I need to follow up with everybody about the NDAs. Okay, cool. Do I have the template? Okay, cool. I will do that the next day.
And it's not a matter of, you know, maybe the, the marketing people are like, Hey, could you do that? Like all that right now, it'd be great if you did all that right now.
And I'm just like, no, no, I'm not because, because it's, it's not gonna, it doesn't speed up the process any, if we do everything it's, it's, I am a very small part of all the things that you want done in like your life.
So I understand why you're rushing me to get all of the things done on my area. So you don't have to worry about me at all anymore. But at the same time, like, I'm going to take my time with this because the opposite of that is being stressed out. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
And, and stress is, stress is not good for us. I know this is not, this is not new information. This is the stuff that people come to Conduit for, to learn that stress is bad. Yeah. Stress is bad. Just, just, just throwing that out there.
Uh, and whatever you can do to not have that affect you, whatever you can do to help it, I think really like helps, like, let's, let's figure this out to do what you need to do to make it work and the best that you can. And, and, and that's going to be weird. Sometimes it's going to be different.
Sometimes you're gonna, like, it's going to be something that might not seem quote unquote normal. And guess what? That's okay. Don't normal is fiction. Normal does not exist. Don't believe in normal.
Come out here and live your best life and do your best, whatever needs to be done to make it happen, to make it work. And, um, yeah, I do that.
I think that the, like, how, how do you, is there a way that you structure fast productivity and slow productivity, like into a day to day?
Like in my mind, it's very much like slow down the fast things, get to them quickly, but then, and then process, like carve out the slow things into manageable chunks.
Yeah. Yeah. I think it really depends on what my brain needs for the day. Um, because a lot of times it is not. Listen, we all have, you know, those brain frog days. We, we know that happens.
And sometimes, especially if I have outside factors that are affecting me, um, like meetings and stuff, I know that if I take a little bit of slow productivity in the morning, I can do the fast productivity throughout the day.
Um, but also there's some days that I don't have the energy or I don't have the time or I don't have the desire to do, uh, the slow productivity. And sometimes that's okay too. Just sitting, like, just making sure that I have, that I don't lose anything. That's the biggest thing.
That's the most important takeaway for any sort of productivity is making sure that you do not miss stuff because the second that you miss something, you know, it's not working very well. Like that's not, that's not good. And so being able to sit and be like, okay, I'm going to do X, Y, or Z.
I know this needs to happen. I know that we need to make sure that it gets done. Let's go through and make sure that it happens. And that's, yeah, that's how it works. And, and, and, and getting when the second that stuff gets missed, that's when something needs to change in your system.
Now, whether that is just like a one-time thing, that's totally different than like everything is broken. I need to redo everything. Um, but the, the fact of the matter is, is you can do your best, um, do the best that you can do. And, uh, it will be okay. You got this.
I, I genuinely like my connection from last week of getting back in my Hobonichi. I think the thing that I was neglecting was this. It was the, there are some things that are fast and some things that are slow.
Like the, the fast things, like you write, it doesn't feel like it is worth writing them down until you write them down. And then you're like, Oh wait, I can slow these down a little bit. Like having, having that, creating that space for it is great.
The, the, the slow things are the things that like I write down and I sometimes go days without thinking about them, but having written them down brings, usually brings me back to those things more and more.
And whether that's in a notebook in your task manager, project, you know, project manager calendar, whatever. Like I would encourage people to have, have things written down that you've, you do and, or need to do.
Um, obviously, you know, again, this is, this is, these are the hot takes that people come to listen to Conduit for like write down your tasks. Brand new information. You're welcome. You heard it here first, but here's a little context as to, to maybe why it's so important to do so.
And, and Kathy, I hear you on the, like, sometimes you wake up in the morning and you're like, this is just not the, this is not going to be one of those days. Um, something that I've done, and this is, this is a privilege. This is absolutely 100% a privilege.
Um, I normally have to wake up at 6am to get my child ready. And then I have to drive my kid to school and make sure that they're there before like 755. Yeah. I wake up at six, but she doesn't have to be at school until 755. And she recently started taking the bus.
So like, again, she's out the door by like 645 now. And I'm like, this is great. But back when I had to get her up and get her fed and everything else before I took, took her to school, it was like, I'm going to block this time off in my calendar. Yeah.
So that at seven o'clock when I normally start my day, I just like check in, see what's going on. I just make sure there are no meetings for when I'm supposed to be like dealing with my child.
That has become a godsend because now what happens is no one books meetings with me until about like nine o'clock, which means I can start my day at the pace that I need to start it at. And that can be like, I need 15 more minutes. Like sometimes that's the answer.
But then the answer can also be like, okay, well, I know that for the next hour, hour and a half, no one's going to bother me.
If I need to sit down and like deeply get into my notepad and like just or my notebook and just start like writing out all the things about a thing that needs to get done or all the things that are still stressing me right now.
Or all the things about like, oh crap, my plants been sitting in, you know, whatever. Like I'm, I have time to do that. And again, like I understand that that is, that is a privilege that I have.
 But what I would also tell people is like, if you can, if you can kind of put something in your calendar that prevents people from bothering you in the morning, that has been like, that has been a great hack that I have, I have learned is put something in your calendar to prevent people from bothering you.
It's a good solution. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I agree. So Kathy, it's that time of the show where we talk about the thing that we're going to get done at the end of the show or between this time and the next show. Yeah. Oh gosh. Okay. I'm, I'm doing the thing. I am.
Basically, I need to load new products into a Shopify and. I need to do that. So that is what I am doing. Speaking of shops, visit Yukon, where it dot com. Yeah. Some kind of merch. That's, that's awesome. Um, my task is. My task is going to be regain, regain control.
Um, kind of what I've, what I've been talking about a little bit with this is, uh, some of the things that I've got coming up. One of that, one of those things being the event on the 20th and then some of the other stuff that I got to do.
And then me traveling like the week before, and I'll be in like three cities. Uh, I'm doing a mini J tour. If you live in Oakland or Kansas city or Chicago, reach out to me because I will be in those cities doing things. Um, yeah, it's going to be fun. Maybe not the Oakland one.
I think the Oakland one, I'm kind of, well, actually we'll play it by ear. You're like, yeah. If you're around, if you're around and you make the effort to reach out to me to be like, Hey, I'm in this area, then I will, I will do my best to make sure that I'm make myself available to.
I'm just terrified of Oakland because they like to smash and grab people. Well, let's, let's do this too. Uh, if y'all are in Prague, um, say hi. Yeah. You're one of our five listeners in Prague. Um, wait, we have five listeners in Prague.
I don't, I don't, I don't think we have any, I don't think we have any. I need to know. I know. I don't, I don't know. I don't know how to do that, but yeah, maybe it might be in Libsyn. I think it's in Libsyn. Yeah. I don't know.
But Hey, anyone in Prague, I'll be there from the 13th through the 16th. And yes, I realize it's a very short time. It's fine. I can't type right now. I will figure it out eventually.
Um, but yes, in all of that stress, I have been left with like, oh, I feel like I don't have control of things right now and it's making me anxious.
Um, so I want to just make sure that like, I, I take some time and do some, some like, um, what's the word? Um, uh, like I want to make sure that I, I allow some dedicated time to, to do, to do the thing. Okay.
Um, and that, that's where, that's where I think that it would be helpful to, to go and like, I don't know, do some planning or something. Oh, this isn't fair. Kathy, we don't pay for the bi-country stats. So we would have to upgrade our plan to figure out. Yeah, we're not doing that.
Yeah, exactly. We're not doing that. We're just going to say that there are five people in Prague. Uh, so the five people in Prague, hit us up. We're glad, we're glad to know you, but also hit us up. Yep. We're approaching a quarter of a million downloads. Kathy, I just wanted you to know that.
Well, I didn't want to know. Uh, are you, are you going to do the thing? I'm going to, I'm going to sit in, sit in the silence for a second as I try to remember what I do next by literally just scrolling.
Of all trades of the show, Carl says next connection, try to ponder and think about purpose and meaning in my life and what direction I should be going, or maybe just start small and get my connection checks in on time.
Listen, I'm not going to say that maybe pondering and thinking about the purpose and meaning in life is a little much to hope for in a fortnight, but let's start with something small. Just saying. To-do list, get life together. Yeah.
Um, I can see and Carl, Carl understands the value of sitting in the moment and, and dedicating it to something. Um, anyway, our checklist enthusiast of the show, Mike says start working on the outdoor lounge.
I'm working on turning our screened in room into an all seasons room for entertainment and relaxation. Ooh, that sounds nice. Ooh, nice. Nice, nice, nice. The, uh, of the show, uh, says new connection, get better exclamation point. I've been sick for over two weeks and I'm getting real tired of it.
Time to be healthy, please. Yes, please get better. I hope a doctor's visit was a part of that. If it's, if it's over like three days, you should go see a doctor. Um, tech podcast listener of the show pillock says, keep it going.
If I get told my tests were successful, it shouldn't take too long to be at a state that I can show some interested people. Okay. Yes. Uh, yeah. Uh, our profane sleeper of the show.
Mike says new connection, supporting my wife while undergoing her chemo and radiation treatments and occasionally finding time for myself. I did not get to go see the new chainsaw man movie just yet. That sounds like a perfect, perfect connection. I am very interested in chainsaw man.
I haven't watched it yet. I haven't watched any of it yet. Um, but I've also been told. I don't even know it's a thing. Oh, it's an anime. Oh, gotcha. It's a, it's a man who has, is a chainsaw. He has a chainsaw for a head. Wow. Wait for a head. Not a hand. Okay. Okay. Cool.
Um, I think that, I think he also, they also like the chainsaws are like spiritual chainsaw type things. So I don't know. It's confusing. Okay. Our robotics engineer, the show Aiden says practice my French for an upcoming trip to Quebec in a few weeks. Uh, we, we.
Uh, our identical twin of the show. Aaron says new connection, starting a new freelancing project to complete over the next month or so. I want to hit the ground running and try to make a lot of progress over the next couple of weeks. So I have time to deal with any issues that arise.
See, look at that planning. Slow planning. Love it. The Esperanto knitter of the show says, uh, Irisano says, uh, get better enough so I can go home. Cause I had to postpone my return journey and eat more chocolate and all the tasty food I can get my hands on.
Sometimes I think that S that Irisano is just a cat. Yes. It's like, I need to go home. I need to eat chocolate that I'm not supposed to necessarily eat unless I am supposed to eat it and all the tasty food and then go home. I love it. Yep.
Our soprano of the show, Devo says next connection, order a new vacuum. That's exciting. Our chief Swifty of the show. I was like, wait a minute. That sounds like something you just said. Our chief Swifty of the show, Aaron says, begin engaging my community. Using social media. Oh, look at that.
So good. Bring that business stuff to life. Woo. Our Oracle of the show. Sof says next connection. November is another awfully busy month. Drink water, breathe, move the body occasionally, and it will all be fine. Yes. Love that. That should be a song or something.
The nameless of the show nameless says, get the AV team scheduled and signed up for the holidays at church. I need to know who am I counting on for those weekends and help them be as ready as possible for the events to come. Also prepare for the seasons.
I'm teaching on the last, I'm teaching on the last conference for the year. Woo. That's, yep. Yeah. The end of the year is approaching soon. How about also prepare for the sessions I am teaching on the last conference for the year? I don't know. That might be what nameless meant. Oh, nah.
