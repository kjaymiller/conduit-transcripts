From Relay FM, you're listening to Condo It, the show where we condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Condo It, the show that is here in the present to discuss the future that will then have been talked about in the past. I don't know.
This episode is brought to you by P, which is a hydration app. And I'm Kathy and with me today is this J guy. Hi J. I'm just working on building a legacy of episodes with Kathy. Who lives who dies? Who tells your story? All right.
Well, this week in the discord Alex Cox tried to get me and or J to do a truly chaotic podcast. That was what was this podcast because I came in after I got pinged. Yeah, yeah. So their idea basically and I think it, I think they woke up in the middle of the night.
And it was like, hey, I think a podcast hosted at 3 a.m. Central time in the U.S. and 9 a.m. whatever a London time is. And then is reversed the next week is a great endurance challenge that I should facilitate. To which I said, sure, but the amount of money that that would take is significant.
Because I don't do like I would need time. Yeah. That would throw off my entire schedule. I can usually adjust fairly quickly. See traveling to Taiwan or going to Europe and London and that sort of stuff. Like I don't really get hardcore jet lag.
But I would absolutely have jet lag being expected to be awake that early and then like really late and like bouncing back and forth. That would definitely mess me up. I mean, I would for the right amount of money, I can be bought. My time can always be purchased. That's what I'm saying.
Like I don't know what that number looks like. But I would definitely. Mine's the only of the most people think. Really? Yeah. I think if it doubled, if it basically did what conduit was doing, maybe. If it was doing more than what conduit is doing, then probably. Interesting.
Especially if like Alex has involved. I'd love to do a show with them. That would be fun. I say that. I say that, now. I would also love to do a show with them. I think that conduism, the show, would be one that Kathy would absolutely hate. But it's so much fun.
Just conduit meets roboism would just so much, so many things happening that would be great. Yeah. I don't know if I could handle managing both of you. It was really hard doing that just that one episode. So yeah, let's not and say we didn't.
What happened last week in the co-working, Jay? Well we went through. That you decided to show up on. What are you talking about? I showed up on time, didn't I? I don't actually remember. I think I was early. I think I was early. Oh, that's right, you were. Actually, the slander. I know. I know.
Because I'm just so used to it. Let's see. We configured our calendars. I don't even know what that means. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember what it meant. So, folks, get ready for the big switch. Big shifts. Switch. I like switch because we switch off usually at the end.
For those who are great, I'm going to explain it as if I was John Sericusa on another show. If you don't listen to the end of the show, well, we can't be friends. But also, we have some music that plays at the end of the show. And when we do, there are three switches that get turned in a direction.
Are they being switched on? Are they being switched off? Who knows? Well, in a few weeks, there will be the big switch. In which conduit will be switching our release schedule. That's right. Many of you have asked for it. No, you're still not getting it.
We are going to do two episodes back to back. And then continue our normal podcasting schedule. But with the calendars swapped.
So basically, if you're listening to this, imagine in a month's time, we would basically just do two shows back to back and then go back to the other every other week schedule, like we had been doing. And this was important because apparently I'm gone all of September. And so is Kathy.
Yeah, basically we had some concerns and issues with scheduling. There were several times that we were not going to be able to match up. And like, we have to have somebody and we didn't want to miss it. But yes, Lara is saying what I was kind of thinking. Okay, I'm bad at this apparently.
Sometime in September, there's going to be two shows back to back. And then after that, it'll be every other week, like it's always been. But we needed to flip the schedule so that the weeks that we normally don't record, we start recording on. Nothing will change.
Except for that will just be two episodes that are back to back. That's all you worry about. Okay, so right now we are recording this on July 8th. Okay, we record on Tuesdays. We will be recording July 22nd. And the co-working will also swap. So July 15th will be co-working.
July 22nd will be conduit. July 29th will be co-working. July or August 5th will be conduit. August 12th will be co-working. And then August 19th and 26th will both be a conduit episode. And we will then swap off. So September 2nd will be co-working. September 9th will be conduit, etc, etc, etc.
Basically, what this does is this shifts so that we all will be able to have recordings. Because although to be fair, to be fair, my September ended up not being the way it was going to be. But this works for October 2. So we're just kind of, we just decided to make the big switch.
How is that less complicated? If you want to know when we record and when we do co-working, email me specifically at do not reply. Oh my gosh. I know it's on relay.fm. Go to relay.fm slash live. And that will, that will take you to where you need to go. Or sorry, relay.fm slash schedule.
There you go. Wait, that exists. What? Yeah. Yeah. Today it takes you to the Google calendar that is updated. Oh my god. Wait, what? Yes, 8 in September. We are switching the order of the recordings and the co-workings.
Why does the Google, why does the, okay, I need to file, I need to file a, uh, uh, feature requests here. Why does the conduit page, oh no, this is because we're live. That's when it is. If I hit play, will I hear myself? I'm not going to hit play. Yes. Please don't hit play. Okay.
Please don't hit play. I have to never mind. I, I, I thought like if we were on conduits like schedule page, but whatever, this is fine. This is fine. Okay.
We're going to, we're going to, uh, uh, uh, uh, to our fantastic editor here, please make this a whole chapter because people are going to skip it. It's cast, but if any of those things sound like fun, um, the co-working or the discord, make sure to visit I am a superconductor.
com to become, to become, wow. To become, to become to become a member today.
Uh, you can also, you will also get access to a wide variety of the members specials that have just come out, including another one, um, from Rectives that will be coming shortly that was a surprise to everybody, which is fantastic. Um, but yeah, we would love to have you as a member.
Um, and, uh, we're so happy that you are here and listening to us right now, though, even if you aren't a member. So thanks for being here. Um, shout outs. Uh, is this, uh, are these the same Andrew that you're having? I don't know. I'm just, okay. You do yours. I'll do mine.
Maybe the same person if they are going to smell.
Our chief Swiftie of the show, Andrew says, uh, for me specifically, if I'm still struggling with the power situation and air conditioning and the ridiculous heat, consider tying, trying a damp paper towel around a cold or frozen bottle of water in front of your office fan.
This can act as an improvised air conditioner. Hope it helps. I wish I had done my research and actually looked at the stuff before we started recording because then I could do that and that would be a really, really smart idea.
I know I've done that with a, like, a bowl of ice before, but that doesn't last nearly as long as a frozen bottle of water with a damp paper towel. So I'm definitely going to try and do that next time. So thanks Andrew.
And shout out to Andrew, uh, to, to follow me on LinkedIn and just gave me a nice message about how they've been listening to conduits since day one. And that's always a, that's always a good thing. That's so sweet. Yay. Uh, well, it's now time for our connection checks.
For those of you that maybe might be new, connection checks are where we host our accountability portion of this podcast. And talk about what we did in the last two weeks. And if we met our desire to get it, get something specific done, um, Jay, did you finish your blog post? Nope. Cool. Moving on.
Yeah. That's just kidding. Yeah. Nope. That's that's all I got was. Okay. Cool. Are you going to, are you going to try and try and finish it or is it one of those? Nope. Not going to happen type of a thing. So I don't know yet. I think I am going to finish it. Like I just, I just didn't do it.
Like if I'm being honest, uh, my, I got the sensors that I've been waiting for for my plans and I was way more engrossed by that. And then there was also like a 3D printer that I got that we're going to talk more about in the post show because it's a whole process.
Um, and I was way, way, way more interested in that than writing a blog post. I should probably write that blog post though. Mm. Okay. Good idea. Good idea. Yeah. My connection was to find options for some healthier disassociation instead of doom scrolling. Um, and mine was to, uh, I, I, I, I, wow.
I need my brain is just clearly boiling, but I also tried to like read what Pillix just said. Yes. You can absolutely register a connection, not just a connection check.
If you skip anything, if you don't want to talk about it, any of that, you can absolutely only do half of, of our, um, connections, connection check or future connection. Absolutely. Feel free. Send, send that in. Um, so I am taking up more, uh, cross stitching.
Um, I'm, I'm doing that more often instead of sitting and scrolling on my phone. It's been very helpful as well as, uh, reading. But I also, uh, have one of the things that Laura and I found, um, was an Oracle deck. Uh, we did a lot of cute little shops and shopping and stuff.
Um, and I found a, an Oracle deck that really like called to me. Um, it's a little woo, woo. I know, but what it's been really helpful for is actually kind of targeting my journaling, um, that I've been doing in the morning, which has really helped.
So, um, shout out to the death, the doula Oracle deck, which is not as depressing as it sounds. Um, and, uh, the journaling that I've been able to do with it. Uh, what about our conductors? How did they do? Oh, I don't know. I was too busy generating an image of a bee cumber. Um, yeah, yeah.
Uh, can you breed? I can read our soprano of the show, Debo says green heart made the plans to have friends over brunch and it's even on a calendar. Nice. Yeah. Put it on the calendar. Our pathologist of the show, Laura says connection check, green dragon.
I have had an absolutely amazing time in the last couple of weeks and have done a good job of taking advantage of real downtime, both at home and at the book retreat when my son has been away. I don't know where to put shout outs or how those worked by having listened to the show since day one.
That's fine. We don't either. Um, but huge shout out to Kathy for just being a delightful human real honest human connection is so incredibly valuable and not always very common. And I feel the same way I had the most incredible time.
Laura is an amazing human being and I'm so thankful that we got to spend some more time together. You're going to let it go to her head. Our bunnings engineer of the show said the movie was successful and we are currently in the process of making it feel, oh, the move, not the movie. Yeah.
I was like, wow, it is making a movie. That's cool. The movie was successful and the move was to, um, and we're currently in the process of making it feel like our home.
Oh, what's this other piece here that says, oh, I also don't know where to put shout outs for Jay is just a really, really awesome genuine person. Thank you. So great. Oh, my gosh. Uh, our Carl of all trades. Carl says, evergreen tree.
I did things in the last four night and went to my first therapy session. I've been told I am too hard on my own performance review. So I'm going to give myself a win and see how that feels. That is great.
I love this idea of, um, not being too hard, uh, for your own, like, on your own performance review. Like how would you do this for a friend? How would you support that? Um, and Laura, I also kind of wish that Jay would have had to read yours. And if I had planned that. Okay.
It's not about you, Kathy. It's about Carl. Carl from Good job. On the performance review, come on. I think I think the, the challenge of a good performance review is to be hard on yourself, but to end it with good job, keep up the good work.
Because that's, that has always been my challenge of if I am too hard on myself and I get that like de fetus to mentality, whatever, whatever. But like the whole like, I can't do it. Then I feel like I'm like, well, there's a point in trying.
But then I'm also like, look, I want to be hard on myself. I want to push myself to do more. But I also want to make sure that I just acknowledge the progress that I have made. Yeah.
That's the other thing is like, and take this with a huge grain of salt because I haven't had to do a performance review in like more than a decade. But I think there's also an importance of making sure to shout out what you have gotten done.
Be not just for your own sanity, but because a lot of times the work that people do isn't actually seen by upper management. And being able to call out specifics is a great way to be like, yo, I am awesome. And you should give me a raise definitely that second part there. They give me a raise.
Hey, the identical twin of the show Aaron said red circle zero conversations about vacation planning. But there's always next conduit, right? Exactly. Yes. Absolutely. Always next conduit. Our shark of the show Chris says my connection was to get the garbage cleaned out of my garage and I did it.
Green circle. Good job, Chris. Our doll of the show Molly says greenheart got the large chunks of my library moved over to my iPod along with the smart playlist for my favorite artists. I read that thinking library books and then got to iPod. I was like, oh, but no, that's awesome.
Michael shoot and some truth bombs, the discord bot sucks. That being said, I the resident profane sleeper of the show was to pass along the following connection checks. Red stop sign. It did not work more. Good. Yes. Thank you. Profane sleeper. For sharing your connection.
Our name was of the show nameless said green circle. I journaled with my pin pin and pen. Sorry. I messed it up. My pen, my pen, pin and pan. There we go. I also had the big meeting, the big meeting, the big meeting. Now we just need for the big results. I know.
And the pan, pen and pen was a joke from our co-working session. So awesome. Was it? Yes. I was by a step-a-side. No, we were in co-working and maybe it was last episode and he put a picture of it. That's right. I just remember seeing a photo. Good call. Yeah. I failed. It's fine. Yeah. It's fine.
And this episode of Conduette is brought to you by P, a different kind of water app. Feel better every day by adopting one simple habit. Most hydration apps ask you to tediously track your intake. P takes a simpler smarter approach. Just tap a button when you pee. That's it.
You'll get reminders to drink water when you need it most. This one small habit helps you get in tune with your body. Sounds weird, but it works and the users love it. The Apple Watch app is a favorite.
Log in seconds on the way to the restroom and keep an eye on your hydration right from your watch face. You can even add friends privately through iCloud so you can ping each other to hydrate.
Jay, did you get my pings when I told you you needed a hydrate after going like six hours without using? Why are you shaving me? Why are you shaving me on the internet right now? Because you need to drink more water.
Funny enough, I once again just got a notification and say, hey, it's been six hours. Yeah. Hey. Look at that. Look at that. It feels great to get that nudge from loved one when you're slacking on your slurping.
P is crafted by a solo indie developer who cares about thoughtful design, privacy, and helping people stay hydrated. It's a free download. So try it today and see how great you feel after just a week. Stick with it and you'll find it's more than just hydration.
It's a whole experience packed with thoughtful features and some surprises. Search for P water app in the app store or follow the link in the show notes. And here's a fun promo for conduit listeners. Once you've downloaded P, you can send the developer a message through the app.
If you're one of the first 10, you'll get a free year of premium features. The P elevate your hydration habits. Our thanks to P for their support of the show, Olive Relay, and my own hydration. I have a message from John, the developer of P. Says, uh-huh. J.
Miller, thanks so much for all the kind words. Actually, this is an actual message. Hold on. J. Miller, thank you so much for the kind words and discussion during the ad read for P.
I didn't try to bury the features, always trying to find a balance between making things highly visible and being overwhelming for new users. But actually working on some changes related to this now. Not sure where to find good contact for info for you or Kathy, but you said to get in touch.
So feel free to contact me through the app at any time. See, this is the great, this is the great kind of like people and ads that we do. That's so great that like even the developers of the things that we're advertising for, uh, just jump into our DMs and John, you're so welcome.
And thank you for being an amazing supporter of Conduit. And the maker of an amazing app.
And if you two have an amazing app and would love to have amazing hosts like Kathy and myself, you know, talk about them in front of an audience of engaged, uh, very intelligent people, um, who have the, the biggest of pockets, um, and all the best of intentions.
Yeah, the largest of heart, medically concerning heart sizes. Um, please reach out to, um, Carrie, not, not me because I can't help you, but Carrie, or reach, yeah, reach out to Kathy, uh, relay.fm, uh, and I will send you to Carrie or Carrie at relay.fm.
But I think sales at, I don't know, we, uh, there's a lot, listen, relay.fm and then hit the sponsors tab support, lots of options, lots of options to reach out. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, we'd love to, we would love to talk about your app.
Um, we're not an app centric podcast, but that doesn't mean that we don't love to discuss it. Uh, another thing that, I mean, they're not sponsoring this show, but they sponsor my life is Timory.
Um, toggle has been going through a lot of, um, interesting changes, uh, and something of, oh gosh, yeah, I mean, kind of, but no, they, um, decided to put restrictions on calls to their server. And they're like, this doesn't mean you can't use apps, except they sent it out.
And then there was no way to actually see, um, or know what cent calls. Um, and so they're like, you're just going to automatically start having to pay without knowing, um, if you're getting close, um, and also they did not tell developers, uh, that that was happening.
Um, so, uh, our friend of the show, um, and friend of the life, Timory Joe of Timory fame, um, like basically did not have an easy time before dub dub to try and figure out what the heck he is going to do. So he's been working on it.
 Um, and I'm really thankful that the discord is here to kind of know and support him, um, as he's going through this, the family traumatic time of his life completely being shaken up without any warning to anyone, uh, and without even some real information, we had some interesting conversations with, um, the company.
Yeah. So go, go support Joe, Joe, rhr, uh, dot com. That's a J Ho E H R I B A R dot com. Um, and you know what, don't, don't just support with Timory for toggle, go to partly sunny, um, and then check out RCS launch pad, um, the NBA mock draft touch screen.
Um, you, you have to have a broadcast touch screen for that one. Also, I think that one got discontinued in 2010. But you know, you know, you can, you can still go support it. Um, yeah, yeah, just go, go support all of Joe's projects, Joe, Joe rhr dot com slash projects. Go check that out.
I like to call him time, where he Joe, because I can't pronounce his last name. Well, we should try harder, Kathy. Yeah, I know. I should, I really should. Um, all right.
So we, um, definitely do planning for this show, um, and have lots of deep, concentrated communications of what we want to discuss on each episode, far in advance. Um, and sometimes that is an hour or two before, you know, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Um, and now we're like, what are we going to do? And, um, our, we've decided this morning, uh, about a couple hours ago. And, um, yeah, we're going to talk about future planning, um, not in the, um, sense of like making sure that we write out everything in our, in our, in our, in our planners.
But in this idea of thinking about the future and like what it's going to bring and what it's going to do, um, for us because I have thoughts, uh, but let's start with you, Jay. How do you, do you do future planning? How do you think about the future? No. Let's see the future.
Well, the future is always approaching, um, but yet always a day away.
Like Annie said, um, when, when I think about the future, I mostly, I mostly think about it in kind of the aspect of like, how do I, how do I sustain what I have long term? So I don't, I don't think about it necessarily of like growth.
Like I have long term goals and things like that, but I'm not necessarily thinking about, I'm not thinking about like in year two, I should have this in year three. I should have that.
It's, it's more of like this time next year, hopefully things are on the positive, like they're moving in a, in a, in a positive trajectory. And if they're not, then like, how did we get here and how do we fix it? The bad, I don't, I don't sit there.
I don't like document or, you know, I don't have a dream or an ambition calendar, or any of those things that often come with planning for the future. Do you write down those long term goals at all? Not at all. Okay. Okay. I'm very, I'm very much like.
I think I'm, I think I am very vocal about the things that I want for my future. Like I've talked about like in my job, I want to move into a management space. If you all have heard this ad nauseam, trust me, the people around me have also heard ad nauseam.
In terms of like, I like lifestyle things like vehicles or any of that, that kind of stuff. Like I don't, I don't tend to think too hard about it. It's like, eh, we'll, we'll need some kind of vehicle in the future.
So let me make sure that like I'm saving up money for a rainy day or for something bad to happen. But then also like if down the road, it's time to, you know, replace a car or something. Then, hey, that's what that money we've been saving for is, is for. So like good, like let's do that.
But I'm not, I'm not ever, like I said, I, I, I struggled to remember what I had for breakfast, let alone coming up with any type of realistic plan for how to get to where I want to be in the future. So a lot of it is mostly just, here's where I am. There is kind of where I want to be.
What's one small thing that I can do to maybe get me closer to it. Like nothing really beyond that. No, I get that, that, that makes sense.
I have a, have a different thought and take mainly because I, okay, so with my family situation, in that my spouse had a stroke in 2010, it's, gosh, it's now almost been 15 years, which is absolutely bananas. That obviously, like completely, like blew up any thoughts for the future.
And this is something that as soon as I can find a new therapist, I'm definitely going to be working through because I know it's, it's significantly affecting my future planning because I am extremely jaded in the fact that I don't, I'm scared basically.
I'm scared of planning too far in the future because I know that stuff can happen that completely derails that. And can I plan something else instead and do that instead? Absolutely.
Like that's, that's, you know, adjusting and, and being nimble and making changes to what you're doing is kind of a part of life.
But it's almost as if my subconscious is like, well, if you don't plan something in the future, when everything goes to poop, you're fine because you're going to have to change it all anyways. And I am aware that that's not quite the healthiest of things.
But again, I need to find a new therapist first to really work through things. But that being said, I am trying really hard to get passed it.
And so I'm, I'm, I'm trying to make some easier future plans that not necessarily are, are simple or basic like, hey, I want to, you know, I don't even know, do do something simple, eventually I want to, I want to fix my yard. It's we're, we're moving ahead. We're processing through last week.
My kiddo and my dad came and they wrote a tiled everything up. All of the, the weeds that have grown after my mother-in-law, like, like started killing the grass so that we could swap it over. And then they used one of the machines that like pounds everything flat.
So I now have a flat dirt bit in the front. But I also will be having a little rocks coming at some point in the next couple weeks that my mother-in-law is going to be laying out. And I don't have to deal with it. It's just being done. And that will be something that will be able to be checked off.
My list that I don't really have, but it is something that has been weighing on my mind for a while to get, to get finished. And so that being done is helpful because it's also a journey of like, hey, this is, this is okay. It's okay to plan in the future.
It's okay to think about things that are coming down the pipe and to actually do some, some goals in there. But yeah, it's, it's, it's better journey to say the least. I think that there's a difference in some ways.
Like, when I think of future planning, I think of like, the, like, to me, there's like, there's two, there's two like opposing thoughts. There is future planning and then there's long-term project management.
And I think that the two things can exist next to each other, but are ultimately different. And there is that like long-term project management. I have to go cut, oh, I didn't tell you, Kathy, my persimmon tree got destroyed somehow, which makes me really upset.
It fell and it split at the, the trunk. But I have a long-term plan, like a long-term project that is go take, you'll take a chainsaw, cut that tree down because at this point, like, it's gone. It's, it's not, there's no saving it.
But then also processing the wood from it to be wood for a fireplace this winter. So like, I don't really think of that as like long-term planning, but that is a project that like, it's going to involve time.
Like, there's a good portion of that that is let the wood dry out so that it's proper firewood this winter. But it's, it's not necessarily like a, I have a plan, long-term plan that I will utilize my fireplaces more often or something like that.
It's like not, it's like, oh, hey, I want to reuse that wood. I don't want to spend $10 for like two or three days worth of firewood. So let me, let me save, you know, a little bit of money by getting a week's worth off of this tree that fell. Yeah.
But, but the planning for that is, is kind of included because you still, you're like, okay, I'm going to have a fireplace. Like, that's going to be, I don't, I don't know. Again, I'm working on this. I'm working, I'm working through my brain to do this. And, and I, I don't know.
I don't know what it looks like. I don't know. I also have a really hard time like setting those future goals and trying to figure out what it kind of looks like.
And, and what, what, what's the difference between future planning and future project management? I think it's the, the thing that makes conduit so awesome. It's like, we have people here who have future plan.
They have, you know, we, we pick on our friends who listen to us live, but we have like, nameless who has like, straight, like, effectively done a job, a career change, graduate program, and now job like hunting and hopefully finalizing.
And that's like, like, that whole process to me is future planning, but the individual steps to do those things are, those are smaller projects. Before I do this thing, then I need to make sure that I have accomplished this, this, you know, thing one thing, two thing, three.
I don't get to, I don't get to like my future without doing thing one thing, two and thing three. I'm really good at like quickly identifying what those things are. Not necessarily putting them together, but then executing on them individually. And again, I don't necessarily come up with a plan.
It's just like rough idea, rough outline. Like, I don't think I ever could have done what nameless has done. Like, from the idea, from like, conception to completion of, I started here, I'm going to do this, this, now this, and then like, working through it.
For me, I probably would have just been like, I don't like this job. I need to find new job. I found new job. Good. I quit old job like that's, that's like my mentality when it comes to changing a path. Or I don't like this career.
Hey, let me ask a bunch of people different careers that they think I would be good at. And that's what I did. When I went from marketing to developer relations, I just talked to people who were doing things that I thought was cool. And I said, hey, you know my skillset.
What, would you, like, what jobs do you think I would probably be pretty decent at? And they would give me one and I would like, look it up and be like, yeah, no, that sounds like too much work. But then there was like one that was like, oh, you should try this like developer relations thing.
And I was like, oh, cool. What's that? And I like, I talked to people about it. And I was like, yeah, that sounds cool. And then I just asked people, how do I get that job? And they were like, well, you apply and then you do podcasting and things.
And I was like, well, I already do podcasting and things. So like, I've already got that part down. And they're like, well, then you just keep applying and then someone will hire you. And then they did.
But there wasn't like a, okay, I'm going to go to school and learn about this thing that I'm going to do a podcast for like six months. And then that's going to push me into the next spot to do this other thing. And the P app is telling me to go again. And it's like, no, you can wait.
I'm recording. But like, all of these things, the way that I've always operated has always been like, well, what's the next thing I do? Okay, I'm going to do that. And but I'm not thinking about it at all beyond that. Okay. Yeah, you're still thinking about what's the next thing.
I feel like I almost, like my brain starts to shut down when I try and think about what's next. Just because I'm still sitting in what's happening now. And I think that that's okay, though. I can understand from a position of like, I'm afraid to plan too far.
Like that could definitely be a concern. But I don't think that there's anything wrong with like me thinking what's next with my tree that I have to finish cutting down. It wasn't like a, I want to save all this time and money by having firewood. It was, oh, no, my tree fell.
I have to get it out of my way. Well, since I have to get it out of my way, I might as well use the wood for something.
 It was, it's more like taking the opportunity and like, just kind of spur the moment going with the punches, like just rolling with it instead of being like everything has to, not everything has to go according to plan, but like there's even a plan in which it could be good or bad, or it could like go on the rails or go off the rails up.
Like, I don't have rails. There are no rails for me. Like, we're just doing doughnuts in the dirt. And like every once in a while, like a good idea flies up into the air and we're like, oh, hey, we should do that. Yeah.
Now I can see that I swear every time I think that things are getting like settled because I've got something going on, there's usually like a big like kerfuffle that takes it out. I've been working on a deal for more than a year with a company up here to do a bunch of like SEO stuff.
I got a contract, I signed it. Just yesterday I got notification that they canceled the signing.
And I'm like, hey, hey, what's going on? Well, it turns out even though I had had multiple meetings with members of leadership, including the teams that do like our responsible for what they need to do and want and need help because the stuff is not getting done.
The C-suite people decided that no, this isn't enough of whatever. And I'm just like, okay, well, there goes all of that thoughts in planning and like resource management that I put into it that has been going on for again, for a year.
For more than a year, I have been in talks to try and get this going. And that's all like we're back to, I don't know.
And I'm just like, what the heck, like why, yeah, I don't know if it's like this current situation that I'm in, that's just like making me extra like grumpy about everything or what.
But yeah, it makes me just want to curl up and be like, okay, maybe I'll like, why am I still doing things? It's an incredibly valid reason to be like flust like frustrated about it though. Like I definitely feel that.
I think this is one of the things we were talking about this a little bit in the pre show about like people who are like celebrating several years of being an independent, you know, creator and things like that.
And my thoughts are like, I can't do that because the, the stability of like, I know when I'm getting paid, like straight up, if we win the business, I get paid. If we don't win the business, I can still get paid. And I understand that that is a luxury that a lot of business owners don't have.
Yeah. And a lot of content creators too. Like, I have friends who are content creators and I worry, I think about them a lot and I worry about that because they do plan around like, oh, hey, we've got, you know, I have this type of video that does really well.
And that video has to do well because it makes up 85% of like, my livelihood. Um, good example. You know, I guess a good example for me in my instances, the nonprofit that I run, we have one event in which we normally make the majority of our donations from.
And we did a quarter of what we did last year. And we did about a third of what we were hoping that we could do. Um, and we were already kind of being like, it would be really great if we could do that. But like being realistic, we're probably going to get like half. We got half of that half.
 Um, and it, and it's like one of these things where it's like, at the end of the day, if, and I guess tying to the second part of the thing that we talked about with legacy, at the end of the day, me not fulfilling my legacy of having a successful nonprofit, or whatever that is, like that doesn't change the intention that I set out with.
And that doesn't change the who I am of it. And I think that's where the like, like, Kathy, you are the internet's busyness unicorn.
Like, if someone doesn't appreciate that to the point of wanting to work with you or wasting your time through the process, all of the planning in the world can't prevent that. Yeah.
But tying your ability capability, your like, instinctual thoughts, patterns, planning, pre-planning, post-planning, all that stuff, none of that is indicative on someone else making a horrible decision.
And or just these random, and I'm calling them active God events, because that's what insurance calls them, the like, insurance is designed for pre-planning.
People get insurance because they're like, well, what if something happens? And then literally insurance policies have these active God clauses that are like, oh, hey, I want to be insured in case lightning strikes my house.
And then an insurance company will say, lightning striking your house is an act of God. Therefore, we don't ensure it. They don't know how to plan properly for things that just randomly happen.
 So having that space to be like, look, if the people who literally have an entire industry devoted to preventing or like preparing for the things that are going to happen, if they give themselves the leniency to be like, there are just some things you can't control or plan for, I feel like we as people can probably do the same.
Yeah, that's a really good point.
And having had enough acts of God in my situation and my life, it comes down to, okay, well, then why bother planning at all?
If I'm just going to have to keep rolling with the punches as Laro is saying, when like, why it's all going to have to change anyways, why put any energy into to making those choices? I mean, my answer would be just don't because I'm a global human.
And that's kind of the place that I'm at. But it's like, okay, what do I want my business to look like? What do I want it to do? And I don't know. Yeah, I think that the, I think the boxing metaphor works really well here. That's like, everybody's got a plan until they get punched in the face.
Mike Tyson said that. But there is this like, at some point, I think it's relying less on the game plan and more on the training. Like, everybody is constantly coming up with a plan. And because everyone's coming up with a plan, no one's working together so that their plans coordinate.
I'm pretty sure no one thought that AI was going to be the thing that like comes for everybody's jobs. Like, Kathy, I can't even imagine how many people were like, oh, I could replace Kathy with AI. And it's like, no, you can't. Like, good luck trying.
You're just going to pay Kathy double now because you're going to have twice as much work for her to do. But the, the idea is if I get enough reps in on figuring out how to solve this problem, then when it comes up, when it's in my space, then I know how to deal with it.
Or even if you're like, I don't know how to deal with this particular problem, this is very similar to this other thing that's happened. And I, I was prepared to do that.
So what if I took that and I just modified it to fit this problem? That's, that is why I don't like planning, but I like being prepared. There's a difference between like planning and preparedness. Yeah.
No, that's a good point because I definitely over prepare for things like packing, like making sure that I have supplies that I need, except for apparently my, you know, contact lens case while going to a camping retreat. That's fine.
Thankfully, one of the neighbor cabins she had brought to and so I got to have that one. So that was, that was a win because then I didn't have to drive 20 minutes into town. I guess it wasn't that far. But like, who knows if I could find a store that actually had them.
But where crisis was averted. And I'm now going to always have an extra case. Yeah. I have invested in, I think it was the first time I heard of this was Casey Liss, which was like, you have a tech bag and you never steal from the tech bag.
The tech bag goes in your backpack and like, you don't ever, those cables, those plugs, those always stay in that bag. I have two of them. I have one for international trips, which has like converters and stuff.
And then I have my normal tech bag that I take with me between like coffee shops and like short trips. Yeah. I have, I have my toiletries bag. But unfortunately, it opened, it had unzipped and opened in my suitcase. And I thought I had grabbed everything out of it. And I had not.
So that's again, on me. But as I get ready to pack for a trip that I leave tomorrow morning, leaving my house at 4 a.m. My kid is taking me to the airport and they were shocked, saddened and surprised to learn that coffee shops are not open 24 hours.
And that no, we can't stop and get a coffee on the way because nothing is opened yet. That was a really fun conversation. I mean, you could get coffee like a dinny's or something, but like, we might swing by, you know, a convenience store. It's a bad dream out on the East Coast.
Wallpiles has always got your back. There we go. So you can garbage quality food. But yeah, no, actually we have, we have a gas station here that close by that has actually fairly good. I mean, it's not great, but it's not terrible coffee. So we'll see if they are open.
Because I think they're open, but I don't know. We'll find out. Yeah. Kathy, I just don't want you to, I don't, I don't want you or any of the listeners to feel like if they are not prepared for the next 5, 10, 20 years of their life that, or they haven't planned it out that they're wrong.
Because like, I, everything changes, I mean, in the US, everything changes every 4 years when we elect someone new to do stupid things like, yeah, that's the other part is who knows what the world's going to look like thanks to decisions that are being made. Yeah.
So like, I, I try to, I try to like just maybe focus on the pieces of that that you can control. And then like, get some reps in on like, all right, how, how am I going to handle this type of situation? How am I going to handle if these things happen? And it doesn't need to be a plan.
You don't need to write it down. You just kind of like work through it. Like, I love that, you know, you and, you know, and I'm, you know, you and Laura were like, hey, we need to inject peace into our lives. Here's this retreat. Let's not invite Jay. Yep. Yeah. That was exactly that.
How did you know the conversation that we had? That was, that was the thing. Yeah. That was exactly how happened. I mean, the whole like tattoos and stuff and all the, the funness around that, like none of that was planned.
And yet it was one of the, I would think it was probably one of the best parts of the trip. Yeah. So just let your life have those those moments. That whole weekend was very much about vibes.
What are the vibes saying? What is the, what is, what is the energy? The universe is going to take me where I need to take it. But Laura says we mostly talked about how you weren't there. And it was great. Yes.
You know, like, you know, as we're reaching chapter five, it's so great that Jay's not here. He just ruined it. Yep. Yep. Exactly. That was the conversation. It's just so funny because that whole weekend, I was talking about vibes. The universe was going to take us where I needed to take us.
I like, we were going to get the restaurants that we were going to eat at the food that we wanted to eat the tattoos that we were going to get. And I don't know why I'm now stuck in this brain space of not able to let that be the life that I'm going to lead.
And I don't, I don't know what I can do to get back. And I think it's because other people are, are reliant upon this. Yeah. I had unicorns that were going to be helping with this massive project. And now they, like, their summer is, has changed too. Yeah.
And so basically what I'm saying is, hey, if you are a small business or a larger business, maybe that doesn't have sea sweet people that don't pay attention to meetings and conversations that are had.
And you need some help in a variety of reasons, a variety of areas, processes, planning, organization, as well as like actually getting things done, SEO and renaming projects, all of the boring things. Reach out to Kathy. Actually, let's not do my relay email. That sounds to self-promotion.
Magic at the unicornsidekick.com or the unicornsidekick.com in the contact form. Look at that hard hard sell there. I love it. Kathy, I feel like what you have. I feel like what you have is very much what my daughter resurrected from the conduit graves. I think you've got a brain frog.
She said that the other day, and it was the most adorable thing. That's so cute. I was like, oh, yeah, there's like brain fog or something. I had brain fog and then she was like, what's a brain frog? And I was like, it's a brain frog. I love it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That was a good.
So yeah, let us know in the feedback tool or email us at an email address that we definitely have. Yeah. conduit. conduit.fm at gmail.com. I definitely check it. Okay. That's good. No, I don't. Listen, I go into the drive constantly because that's where our stuff is.
But let me show you the right now. I'm sorry. Let me check it. I mean, if you sent us an email, you didn't know. Oh, hey. Our conduit. That's where all of the stuff for cotton beer notes goes. Well, thank you for buying our first. You can wear it.com. Thank you.
Keep buying the merch so that it can all go into our inbox that it ever gets ready. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Right. Oh, except 60 days. Apparently, I got it. They send emails that say, you haven't sold anything on cotton bureau in a while. Ah, well, 60 days and no sales.
Don't beat yourself up. Oh, geez. That's the worst. Wow. What are you doing? Wow. That that, that, that hurts. That hurts. That's where it.com. Hold on. Let me give me some stickers or something just to prevent that from happening ever again. Oh, goodness. Yeah. Yeah. That's all fine.
That's all good. Anyways, what are you going to be working on in the next four night? Um, let's see. Let's see. I've got between now and the next episode. I have a conference talk that I want to do a rehearsal on.
And luckily, my company has a pretty decent like process for requesting, like, hey, I want to do a rehearsal. Can we like make this happen? Um, I am, yeah.
So I unfortunately, I have to do those steps which are create a doc and then invite people and then go, hey, it'd be nice if you could help me please. And then I actually schedule and then give the rehearsal. So like, yeah, see, there's some planning involved. There you go.
I got a plan for the next two weeks, I guess. That'll be, that'll be my thing to do is to do a rehearsal for my upcoming talk. Amazing. I am, gosh, I clearly am mentally overwhelmed in a variety of different things. I have two trips in this next fortnight.
I leave tomorrow morning at 4am and I get back Monday late and that I leave again Thursday and get back Sunday. So lots of, lots of travel. You know what? I'm going to do my best to not get sick.
How about that? That feels like I'm in the, in the mental space of that being an important thing to take care of myself with. So I'm going to stay hydrated. I'm going to use the P app, going to eat food. That's good. You should eat food. Yep. Yep.
Fly with my mask so that I don't, you know, get all of those gross germs. Those people that you have to sit next to. Yeah. All of all of that. I'm going to do my best to not get sick. What about our conductors? They're not doing anything. That's a lie. Careful. I'll make your read.
Laura's nice things about me again. Our pathologists of the show. Laura says practice planning only one day in advance. Oh, look, that's an interesting topic. I said, Jay, we can hear you. Oh, yeah. Of course you can. Thanks to my new, much better work schedule. Oh, yeah. Congratulations on that.
I don't always know if I need to go to work until the day before. I need to practice being okay with a little bit of uncertainty and find a planning routine that works for my brain. Oh, hey, that sounds a lot like the conversation. We just had Kathy. Oh, it's the second part.
Oh, also shout out to Jay, who was incredibly like just on the spot with the topic for today because I've totally been thinking about this a lot. Jay, you're incredibly smart and this show wouldn't be the same without you. Oh, thank you, Laura. That's so nice.
Our soprano of the show, Devote says next connection set up the DVR in the guest bedroom. Oh, I love that. Yay. Our robotics engineer of the show, Aiden says figure out a schedule to start swimming again. Oh, that sounds fun.
Our path pathologist of the show, Laura has a follow-up that says just because it's true doesn't mean she said it. But also our Carl of all trades of the show Carl says next connection make forward progress on job hunting before family trip to Washington state.

Yeah, definitely have some time away. Yes. The shark of the show Chris says my connection for next time is to work on getting some documents that I do not need anymore. My shredder needs a work out. I hope your next connection is not replacing a burnt out shredder. Yeah. Yeah.
Our doll of the show, Molly, I just want to say our dolly of the show, Molly, but our doll of the show, Molly says got to focus in on eating, been slipping the past few days. I'll leave the specifics of what that looks like to my dietitian appointment next week. Yeah. Gotta eat. You gotta eat. Yes.
Very important. Yeah. Our profane sleeper of the show, Michael says the follow-up connection. Go back to the water park and spend time with the family due to Texas weather we got rained out last weekend. Ended up going home after they close. Big sad fronny face.
Big shout out to the folks that were impacted by the flash flooding in Texas. Yes. So much love and sadness for so many. This is not a politics show or a current events show, but man, there have been some really terrible things that have been set out out there and it makes me sad.
It makes me sad because it doesn't affect like I don't know the 40 people that died in the process. Right. So like maybe instead of focusing on how do I get a win out of this, we focus on like the people who were actually impacted. So yeah. Yeah. Heart goes out to them.
And our nameless of the show nameless says finished the second half curriculum so I can send it out. I was confused. I was like, I thought you finished school. Clean out the yard after the 4th of July, the wind blew things into the yard.
