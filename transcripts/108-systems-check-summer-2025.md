All right, we ready to do a show? From RelayFM, you're listening to Conduit, the show where we condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that we're ready to do because we both said it at the same time.
Uh, this episode is brought to you by our amazing superconductors, which you can be one. Um, we would appreciate that very much. Go to I'm a superconductor.com letter I letter M letter a superconductor.com. Uh, and join today. I'm Jay, uh, staff product advocate at Ivan.
And with me is the internet's busyness unicorn. Um, Kathy Campbell. Hey, Jay. Uh, I'm going to do this mellow tone the entire time because it is a connection. Nope. That's not what it is. Systems. There we go. Time episode. Um, and that has nothing to do with my mood or anything else.
I just started this and now I want to continue it for the entire show. Um, hey, Kathy, what did we do this week in the discord? Yeah. This discord. Wow. This discording was discording. This discord is wow. Woo. Uh, if you want to join this discord, which is wow, I'm a superconductor.com.
We celebrated relays 11th anniversary. Um, there was a Q and a done that is actually in the departures feed right now, as well as in the crossover.
So if you are not a member and you want to get a little sneak peek on kind of what backstage is check it out on, um, the departures feed, uh, and there'll be, um, some Q and a stuff. Um, and we also reminisced about the 10th anniversary in London, um, which was a year ago.
Uh, and that was, uh, bananas to think about. That was the first time I got to meet Kathy. We met in, in Atlanta before. After. After. Ah, you know, time it's complicated. Yep. Um, speaking of allow me now to open up photos, search for London and drop in.
Wait, Kathy, do I have your consent to drop in a photo of the two of us? Okay, good. So I'm going to drop in two photos and boom. Yay. I was getting to hang out both on stage, uh, and outside of a giant brick building. The tower of London. Well, yeah, I mean, I know what it was.
Well, I was just telling the people. Just for that. Here's what I've been. Wait, what is this three second video I have of Kathy? Oh no. Oh no. What? I'll just send, I'll send this one to Kathy and like, that'll, that'll just be for, for us to share.
Cause that one, I was like, I don't know why I have this, but it's funny. I'm really scared now. Well, while you're looking at that in our coworking last week, um, we talked about car registration, tattoos, forgetting that we have tattoos. I remember that.
Cause I've, I forget that I have tattoos all the time. Um, pillics needed instructions on where to go while, uh, running around the city. And yeah, we found out a lot about cottage cheese, what it is, why Kathy enjoys it. Why I'm still not certain that it's either cheese nor cottage.
Um, but there, there was a lot. And if you want to join us for more fun and shenanigans like that, um, you can by becoming a member today. I'm a super conductor.com. You also get access to that discord. Now it's time for a new segment, something that we are calling the OGT, the one good thing.
That is one good thing that happened in the lives of our co-hosts and ourselves. And ourselves. And I wasn't, I was kind of confused. I was like, is this, is this other thing in here also, or is it just a shout out? Um, but also it could be. One good thing. Ooh, challenge for all of our listeners.
Just like you would do a connection check. Send us your good things. Tell us something good that happened in your life. We want to know. We want to hear. We want to hear the habit. Maybe we will select one and put it in the one good thing.
Um, Kathy, what was your one good thing? My one good thing was the weather in my state of Oregon has not been in the hundreds for multiple days. We had rain on Friday, which was incredible. I have been able to take Ophelia on a walk in the afternoon without dying or feeling like I was dying.
It was great. I was able to sit out on my hammock in the backyard. Like we are living our best weather life here. I like that. Also love that. Now you don't have to run the AC and ruin the I'm kidding. No one ever heard every time. Every like episode. Kathy was like, sorry, there's a fan blowing.
Never heard it. Good. Never. And if you did hear it, don't tell me. Shut up. No, you didn't. We don't, we don't upload our audio at a high enough quality for you to hear it. So just deal with it. If you heard it as your own fan.
Um, my one good thing was that, um, my, my wife was hanging out, uh, at the animal shelter that she works at twice a week or she volunteers at twice a week and she had to go volunteer an extra couple of days because she got to be a part of one fostering and two adoptions in the last, uh, conduit.
Uh, and it's always good to give, you know, sheltered animals a home. Um, some of them are, you know, at the end of their lives and just need somewhere peaceful with people who love them and others are at the beginning of their lives and looking for them. You need people to love them. Yeah.
That's, that's kind of it. And, you know, it's, it's always a happy thing to see when like cats get adopted, our cat, uh, was adopted almost 12, 12 and a half years ago, 12 years ago, 12 years ago. How long have I been married? I don't know. 12 years ago.
I had to think about it because we adopted the cat shortly after we got married. Um, so yeah, it's, it's one of those things where it's like, I, I love the idea of adopting and things like that. Um, especially with animals giving like young animals, like get home, um, versus a lifetime of struggle.
Uh, and then, uh, we'll go with this one comment from the, uh, connection or I guess from our shout outs. That seems like a good thing. Pretty sure the robot is fixed. So for those that don't know, we've had to deal with our chat bot that does all of the connection check stuff.
It's been on the fritz. People had, uh, people were going on the website, which still works. It's fine. You can do that. Um, it's just one of those things where we were like trying to figure things to hope that it works. Um, and then yeah, it works, which is great.
It has, it has worked, which has been fantastic. It has worked. Um, then we've got, uh, a super awesome, uh, update from Mike or checklist enthusiast of the show who said, here's my connection check shortcut. And I hope the bots work.
Um, and then they provided a link to the shortcut, which we will include in the show notes.
And then our doll of the show, Molly says, I appreciate the usage of the phrase multi-level marketing girlies as a gender neutral phrase, since it's often it's the reverse, you know, I, I don't remember who said this. Probably me.
I would like to start using the term girlies as a gender neutral phrase. No, but that's because I'm an agent of chaos and I just love pissing off. Specifically, specifically the multi-level marketing girlies. It's just gonna, I mean. Yeah. There's no reason not to girlies is a state of mind.
I love it. The challenge that I have with this is I have, so we've talked about this slightly before, Kathy, and that the industry that I'm in has the highest, like usually statistically the highest number of, uh, women in that like tech space.
Um, and there have been some pejorative terms that have been adopted because of that, because of that, I guess. Like I hate being, I hate it when we're being, when we're referred to as booth babes. Um, cause that is a things that, that is a thing that we often get called.
Um, which again, for my colleagues who, and the people of my industry who identify as female, uh, one, a booth babe gives the intent that you are only there because of your like physical appearance.
Um, and I know so many bad-ass women in tech that are developer advocates, um, and work in DevRel who are so freaking smart and so freaking technical that like I rely on their expertise all the time when I'm doing my job. So like, I hate that.
 So I'm, I'm a little conflicted into like, I will just throw girlies in front of everything, but I also want there to be more examples of like, it's okay to assume that if you didn't know the gender of this person that did this super awesome job or this super multi-level marketing thing, I guess, um, that they could be identified as women is super awesome.
So again, I'm conflicted. I don't know. Yeah. Well, and, and for the, for the record, the multi-level marketing, not a positive aspect necessarily. Um, but that's okay. Anyways. Anyways. Zap. Look at that. It's time for the connection. Check. I couldn't make it rhyme. I tried.
Um, Kathy, what, what did you do? My connection for the last fortnight was to sit with myself and listen to endel. Um, and, uh, I, Hey Kathy, what's endel.
Endel is, uh, an app that kind of AI produces sounds, um, and audio energy vibes, I guess is the best way to put it, uh, in order to, um, like really help like focus. Um, and, uh, as I mentioned previously, a little bit earlier, I have been in a heavy ADHD brain space lately.
Uh, and, uh, this has really, it really, really helped. Um, and in fact, like I told, uh, Jay, I almost wish that systems check episode had been not this week because things are kind of in flux right now. Um, but it's good.
Uh, and, and basically that time sitting and being bored as mentioned in the last episode, um, has kind of has helped that. So good job for me. I wanted to, I had to do some competitive research for work. It was an interesting experience. I actually really enjoyed doing it.
And then like, in the end I was able to actually get it done on time. I'm more happy at the fact that I was able to like get to a point where I was like, Hey, there's no point in me continuing this.
A part of, a part of getting this done early and being able to do other things was like, Hey, we don't need all of this. So it was, it was really interesting to be able to, um, just get it done.
Like I said, it was one of those things where I was like, I knew that if I didn't just start it, then it would get the best of me.
But eventually it was, you know, it was, it was a pretty, like, once I got it done, I was like, Hey, you want me to do this like two or three more times? There's no need to, we've got, we've got enough, enough information from this. Um, and I'm happy. And I also kind of got a process put in place.
Um, so then now when there is this desire for, I guess, figuring out how to, uh, do this kind of research in the future, but also just other things, any type of exploration of a service or a product or things.
Um, Kathy, how would you, how would it make you feel to know that I used the conduit transcription tool that we, that was created to transcribe conduit episodes? Um, like the automated, the automatic like generation stuff.
Um, I used it in this process because I set it up to where you could pass in singular files. So I would, I like fake live streamed these things where I basically just recorded myself going through them.
And then to create my summaries, I basically created a template of what I wanted an example of a good one. I did the first one and it took the longest. And then I connected the transcript to it. And then I said, now here's the next video that I've done. Here's the transcript.
I need you to solve for X. I need you to create the report based on the transcript. And that saved me so much time. I'm, I'm glad that conduit was able to, uh, impact you directly. This impacts me directly in the, in like the best ways possible. Um, what about our conductors? Soprano of the show.
Debo has a green heart, uh, ironed a bunch of things in my to be ironed pile. Well done. Our doll of the show. Molly says bought a car. Oh, that's awesome. Um, and through the, and through some miracle managed to get my butt home to home Depot to get an extension cable that I needed to plug it in.
Oh, awesome. Congratulations. The, uh, of the show, uh, says a green heart. I had a tough, I had the tough conversation I had been putting off and it was honestly nowhere near as tough as I thought it would be. The conversation ended with a laughter and a hug. I am so incredibly happy for you.
That is nerve wracking. And the fact that you got it done and it ended up not being that bad fan. Freaking tastic. Our fish bear of the show. Fishy Kai says yellow circle. Didn't get nearly as much done on the house projects as I expected. Let's say I made progress.
I mean, what is done if not just so much progress? And there's always more things. That's the hard part. Yeah. That goes on and on. Anto knitter of the show. Irisano says connection check, green check, mark slash yellow square.
Using the sparkles pockets of possibility to move around plans and task tasks has worked really well. Done a lot of decluttering already and emptied out so much space in my office and bedroom that there are now empty shelves.
I kept some of the pet stuff, but got rid of old medication and other things I could easily let go. I don't know. It sounds to me like that's a full on green check mark. But we're so happy for you. I don't remember what the full check was before.
So maybe there was something in there specifically that was missed. But no, I think I think you did a lot and excellent work on that. A robotics engineer of the show, Aiden says yellow book. An attempt was made. The habit hasn't kicked in yet. I will keep plugging away at it. That's OK.
Keep trying. Just keep trying. You can't do it. The identical twin of the show. Aaron says green circle. I put together some hiking ideas for a trip to Quebec. Next step, we'll be figuring out what I want to do in the city itself and how much time I should take off all of the time.
Take off all of the time. The nameless of the show nameless says connection check. I almost got most of the things booked for the anniversary trip coming up. I cannot believe it's already been three years. Well, you got to believe it because it has almost been three years of conduit.
And I'm so glad that you are planning an amazing anniversary trip for us. Yep. Yep. That's definitely, definitely what they're celebrating. Our Oracle of the show. Soph says connection check yellow heart.
I've been pretty good with keeping up on exercise, but not all the time as life has been a bit overwhelming. But some is good. That is correct. Some is definitely good. Our chief Swifty of the show, even though I think it says Swifey. No, that's fine.
Our chief Swifey of the show, Andrew, says question mark, check mark. I don't remember, but I've been accomplishing a lot. Hey, I like that. I like the like, I don't fully remember what I was supposed to be doing here. But what I do know is I've been crushing it. Yes, we love that energy.
Absolutely. From our shark of the show, Chris, my connection was to make room in my office for some more Lego sets that are currently sitting on the floor. And big green check mark for that. Well done.
I have it's probably a topic in the future, but I have been following some people who are doing plant things as a part of like grief management. And plant therapy is interesting and something that I have considered exploring more. And I need more plant things because of that.
And like the idea of Lego sets sitting on the floor, I was like, ooh, Lego therapy also sounds really, really nice. Yeah, for sure. Our checklist enthusiast of the show, Mike, says, Yellowheart, Plan St. Jude campaign. Did some planning of rewards, but nothing really to lock in.
Hey, that's a good reminder that next month will be the big month. Let's not get worried about that at all. Probably not. Big St. Jude plans. Hey, let us know what you think Conduit should do for St. Jude this year. And the year before, we learned that we both hate Gale by playing.
Last year, I thought that was. That was the year before. Yeah, what did we do last year? Last year, we did a Freaky Friday role swap where Kathy became a super expert programmer and Jay played with Photoshop. That's about the level that we got to.
What should we do this year? Maybe Jay should read a book. Maybe Jay could read a Wheel of Time book. You'd have to have started a year ago with how fast you read. It's like, oh, I was like, maybe Jay could listen to the audiobook version of a Wheel of Time book. For accurate.
Maybe Kathy can play a video game or something or adopt a plant. I don't know. Plant would be scary. The plant would be scary. For every day the plant died, didn't die. I'll make a donation. There we go. Yes. Something like that. Love it. Well, we got one last one last person here.
Podcast listener of the show. Pillock says connection check. Green book. Did a bunch of work on the St. Jude app. But there still is some stuff that needs to happen. I love that you still put green here because you did the work. And that's the incredible part. Well done.
Hey, this episode is brought to you by the amazing people who are in our discord, whether they're listening live right now, whether they are talking about pins or pins or pans. Sometimes that happens, too. Or they're planning the big reveal of all the amazing St. Jude things.
There's a bunch of things happening. This is really a very positive community. And that is the relay community itself and specifically the superconductors as well in that.
Kathy, what has your experience been as someone who knows a superconductor or two? What my experience with what? Just just life in general. Yeah. In life. I am so happy, not just for Conduit Tuesdays, but the fact that every Tuesday I get a little hit of my Conduit people is pretty great.
I get to see Jay's face once a week, once a fortnight. But I also get to see a lot of our conductors, our superconductors faces. And that's also really fun. Plus, there's a lot of times we get animal visitors. Mocha is Nameless's dog, who she is perfect and flawless, and I adore her.
But we've also seen other people's cats and other people's dogs. And then sometimes my animals show up, too. And it's a lot of fun. It's a lot of fun. And we get stuff done, too. We actually do get stuff done.
Usually, I will be writing something or printing something or just sowing seeds of chaos wherever I can.
But I want to throw out there that there are so many times where Kathy will remind me, usually via a text message that says, hey, I'm sending you money, that there are people who get value from the show. And that's the only way I can look at it, is people really do value this.
They value the pre-show. My goodness, this pre-show, we talked. We kind of talked in circles. We talked about affiliate links. We talked about chicken tortilla soup that didn't have tortilla in it, only to find out, shocker, it did have tortilla in it. Kind of, sort of, I think.
It was in the ingredient list, at least. Yeah, that's what they say. But also had things in it that maybe people with, you know, some different allergies may not expect for it to have.
And we talked about subscriptions and why, you know, over-reliance maybe on one subscription versus maybe finding that some things we just don't see that much value in anymore. There's a lot. There's a lot. And sometimes it's productive. Sometimes it's not.
Hey, Kathy, football season is starting again soon. You know, that means we're probably going to have to talk about sports. Yay. Can't wait. I just can't wait for you to find the topic that, like, you love talking about that I get to go. I mean, dance season is here, is coming.
I get to do my favorite. My favorite time of the year is the dance team photo shoots. And this year it's real good. And I'm very excited. And we talk about those a lot in our pre and post show banter.
So if you want to hear more about Jay's awesome takes in football, which I will have a post show update about a thing that we talked about in our co-working. Spoiler alert. I did the thing that I was considering doing. I'm just going to leave it at that. And we'll talk about more about that later.
But then, yeah, if any of this sounds good or you just feel like you get a lot of value from the positivity that we hope to bring with Conduit each fortnight, then consider becoming a member today. Go to relay.fm slash Conduit. Or you can go to our super fun link, which takes you to the same place.
And that is I am a freaking money. Also that. Yes. And also I'm a super conductor dot com letter. I letter M letter a super conductor dot com. You do all that stuff like go to any of those, become a member. You're getting more than just our voices more in your ears. You're getting our faces, too.
But you're also getting, you know, access to a community that really is especially in a world where social media is a thing you want to avoid sometimes. It's a great place. I don't go on. I go on one social media network and that's LinkedIn.
And that's because I feel like I have some type of obligation to be there. But then like the only other social media that I visit with any level of regularity is the relay discord. And it's not even a social media, but it's a media and people are sociable. So maybe you should consider joining.
I'm a super conductor dot com. Become a member today. Kathy, it's time for a systems check. What is a systems check? Systems check is where we check our systems. The end. Just kidding. Yeah. I mean, that's that's kind of it.
Back in the day, we used to give them silly names and the silly name era like that Taylor Swift era kind of died out.
But I think it's I think you put it really well during the last systems check and that by us doing this once a quarter, we give ourselves enough opportunity to to like sit with what we're doing for a while. But also have the ability to make changes where we need to. Yeah.
I was just going to say our life, you know, life changes a lot. And the fact that we have the option to keep it open and to make the changes as we need, but also make sure that we are trying to be get the things done that need to get done and kind of be aware of what is happening and what.
And it's a way for us to really concentrate and be like, OK, this is what's going on in my life right now. This is what I know needs to happen.
But I'm not sure what what what are the tools that I'm using? What are the apps? What are the the everything? What are the pieces of it that I'm using that I might need to like make adjustments to and how it's working? And it and it gives us an opportunity to really focus on that.
One of these coming up is going to be the full year where we look at how our system has changed across the year. And that is always an eye opener. Yes. But that's for another that's for future us.
Kathy, you have a lot written down, which I'm not going to say normally this is my my spot to carry because I'm the tinkerer. You got a lot more than I do. So I'm going to let you go. Yeah. So I'm kind of in flux with what's going on right now.
At the beginning of the year, my plans for my business and whatnot were very different than the reality that we're in now. And so I'm going to have to make some changes to a variety of things. So, yeah.
Transentially, if you need an online business manager, check me out, the unicorn sidekick dot com. Or if you want to just visit that and see fun pictures of me in a unicorn onesie. Also the option.
But what this has done is I've needed to do a lot more focusing on kind of what's available, what I'm doing, what needs to happen, that sort of stuff. And part of what I've done. Oh, my gosh, I'm going to murder my dog. Just kidding.
I'm not actually going to murder her, but she can't decide where she wants to be. Hold on. I should also just chime in to go. That picture of Kathy in a unicorn onesie was not generated by AI.
So, yes, Kathy made the decision to publicly post herself in a unicorn onesie and put that on the Internet. So embracing that that vibe, that energy. So basically, I've I have started doing more of a morning setup now again.
I used to in the past do like a significant morning routine and then I just kind of crash out completely and stopped doing it at all. And I'm trying to build up something a little bit differently.
And part of that includes something that I found with our pathologist of the show, Laura, when we did our reading retreat this summer. We went to a really cute little store and I found an Oracle deck that really. Oh, my gosh. Stop. You need to stop. Or you're going to go in your kennel.
Do you need to go in your kennel? Yeah. Yeah. Good girl. So the Oracle deck, I found an Oracle deck that really just kind of called to me.
Now, my level of woo woo is not like, oh, my gosh, I'm going to do a tarot read and this is going to, you know, tell me how my day is going to end up or anything like that. But what the Oracle cards have been doing is kind of letting me focus on something for journaling.
And so what I do is I pull a card and I put the date on and that I kind of answer the question. And my one yesterday, I actually haven't done mine today yet, which is fine. But my one yesterday was the work Oracle card.
And it kind of fit to let me kind of sit with, you know, reexamining what I consider work. And then one of the other things that says, where and when do you feel like you're working? And I was like, oh, that is a really, really good, like question, a good point to think about.
Because a lot of times I will be like, oh, well, this isn't something that is making me money right now. Like it's not an hourly whatever, but it's still for work. It's still getting stuff done.
So the amount of time I put into, I don't know, looking for an outfit for my kiddo to wear for the dance photos. That's kind of work, like doing laundry, doing dishes. This is also work. It's not like it's housework, not paid work, but that doesn't minimize the work aspect of it.
And so that kind of has reconfigured my thinking. And so we're all up and we're up in the air right now with what's going on. But I will link in the show notes. They're the death doula Oracle cards.
Now, before you go, oh, my gosh, why are you doing oral cards, Oracle cards with death? First off, it's a death doula. And this is an official, like a death doula is someone that is there to kind of help you transition or family members to transition to, you know, death.
But more than that, it kind of looks at the world as a whole, not just a particular thing. Anyways, I really like it. They're really pretty. Again, link in the show notes. And then I write in a square Archer and Olive notebook, which has really thick paper.
And then my daily, I guess my I use weekly tracking bullet journal styles with a mood tracker. And I write down a highlight for each day to kind of like concentrate on my daily gratitude, but also kind of remember what happened.
I don't like doing a full long journal because I start getting overwhelmed and judging myself on like what I've written. So writing just one line is perfect. I do have like a one line a day type book, but that was I felt really bad if I didn't write in it.
So this is a way that kind of like messes with my brain a little bit. I use the notebook therapy notebook, which are my favorite notebooks. They're really well made, really cute, really fun. And the paper is great. And I the majority of the writing that I do is with a Studio Neat Mark 1 pen.
And then my daily like note taking for like light to do's of like I just need to scribble something down. I have a Studio Neat Pano book. It's thinner than the Cortex brand notebook, which I like. It fits a little bit better in front of my keyboard.
And because it's spiral bound, I can just turn the pages. I'm not like tearing stuff out and throwing it away, which is good. I really like that. And then I use a lot of my Apple reminders for specifically when I'm out and about. I'm like, oh, my gosh, I need to do X, Y or Z.
I will have it remind me when I get home so that I can then put it on OmniFocus. I was like trying to add the tasks when I was out and about. But when you're driving, you should not be on your phone.
So I use just the voice with my CarPlay in the car, add it to reminders, and then I can add it to where it needs to go. And that's been really helpful. And then, yes, OmniFocus is my main like task manager for the projects that don't have a specific task manager for the clients that I work with.
And one of the other things that we mentioned earlier in the pre-show was text expander. Text expander snippets are my lifeblood. I don't use them. Like I said there, I don't use them nearly as much as I used to. But it's still such a deep part in what I do that I cannot even imagine not having it.
And the other thing that I use all the time is 1Password. And I really wish that they would get their S together because I'm getting real angry with them. And the app is not working the way that I want it to. So let's fix it.
I was about to ask, why are you not happy? Like, what do you mean it's not working the way? Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's, it seems, okay, I will say it has gotten better since the last update.
So I think they might have fixed what was going on, but it was going to a thing where I would have to log in multiple times, like right after another for it to auto populate, like the autofill option, like in the dropdown, I'd have to refresh the page.
It was this whole dance to try and get it to work. At times, I had to go to the app and type it in, in websites that I have had that I know for a fact it does the auto, like autofill should work. And so I don't know what was going on. However, I will say in the last couple days, it has been better.
So I'm hoping that's a fix for the future is fixing. At the very least, please have a password manager of some sort. I don't care which one, but do something. Yeah, please. Yes. Don't care what it is, as long as it exists. And is somewhat like safe, like protected, secure, secure.
I mean, you know, I kind of just want them to have. Right, right. I mean, to be fair, like handwriting it in a notebook is actually one of the most like safe ways to have it. But yeah, have something. Have something. Yeah. Oh, wow. So. So, Kathy, you threw out a lot there.
I'm guessing the death doula cards have kind of been kind of the biggest. Definitely the biggest change right now. Interesting. Interesting. Yeah. Mainly, mainly trying to focus. I did. I tried like journaling as a whole.
I tried, you know, different book prompts and that sort of thing to try and like have a morning. Like concentration time and nothing was really working. But the fact that these are really pretty. It's in an open notebook. So there's no structure to it.
So if I miss a day, it's not the end of the world. All of these things are kind of ticking my boxes. And so it's it's been happening for a while. And and I really appreciate that. I love it. What about you, Jay? OK. Well, there are a lot of different things that are happening that I'm used to.
So it is it is kind of a an interesting hodgepodge of of thoughts that as you were talking, there was like, oh, yeah, there was this. And oh, yeah, like there's so much. Let's start at the top. I well, let's start at the top and then work my way back back to it in a second.
I reorganized my I rearranged my office. Folks who have been in the calls with us that we do in our off weeks have been a part of that in some ways. Two of the biggest changes where I brought most of my plants into my office. I wanted more greenery around me.
There is some concerns that I do have that I'm going to try to unpack a little bit. But the biggest of concerns are presentation means a lot in my industry. So there are things that are set up maybe that are not for me, but are for other people to look at and see.
And like, I guess, do something with I don't know. Like I have plants behind me on my wall so that when I'm in a Zoom call, people can see like three of my little baby rubber plants and then a little nubbin that I'm trying to I'm trying to grow. And I think I think that's fine.
I wish I could see those without having to turn my body all the way around. So there there are some like things for other people and then things for me. I do have some basil starters that I can see kind of off to the side of my desk, but they're not like they give me more anxiety than anything.
Because trying to keep these things alive have been a nightmare. But funny enough, I've I've kind of wanted to actually get more plants because of that and really turn this space into kind of my little plant room.
Mostly because I do find that the plants having something to think about with the plants, I kind of talked about this with like plant therapy and stuff. It gives me something to be concerned about that is low stakes. Like, don't get me wrong.
When one of my little one of my little basil starters dies, I'm like, oh, well, like a hundred of those. It's fine. But there have been like like I have a snake plant. My snake plant is downstairs. It got over watered and some of the leaves started really getting root rot.
And like I then like the root system on one basically just fell off of. Oh, my gosh. And I was like, that's not supposed to happen. Like I lifted it up and like the roots were like separated completely. And I was like, that's not good.
However, that gives me an opportunity to grow more plants because if they fell off, that means that they were kind of wet. Right. I can cut them into segments and then each one of those segments can grow a whole new root system. Yeah.
So there's there's like a whole level of like here's an opportunity to try a thing and hopefully it works. I don't know why it's so important for me to think about this, but I will give a shout out to kind of the person that I've been really watching a lot of on YouTube when it comes to plants.
And I want to make sure I get the name right. Let me go to my YouTube. I want to say it's like planting with crystal, but I might be wrong. Um, I'm going to find it. Oh, it is. It's plants with crystal. Um, and then I will link to her YouTube channel.
Um, one of the things that I love about her channel is that one, she's just hilariously funny. Um, she's very, very funny. Anytime she talks about drowning that hoe, it's like, well, you know, this, we've got this new plant. It's thirsty. She's very thirsty. We got to drown.
I'm like, yes, that's fine.
 That's like, I, I, I love that like attitude, but, um, in some of the recent Q and A's that she's done, she's talked about the experience of, um, a few years ago, losing her husband and kind of an unexpected, um, situation and how kind of the plants have served to feel kind of some of that grief and help her process some of that.
Um, and, and there's a lot there. And I don't think that like, I'm, I'm not grieving the loss of anything, but I feel like that there's, there's definitely, and I think any parent will understand this. Your children will not do the things that you expect them to do.
Um, as they're growing up, uh, you kind of have this, I don't want to say you have like your plan for them. Um, but you kind of have these thoughts of maybe they'll do this and then they'll do this and this. It's like, no, they're going to be their own little kid.
And then sometimes that means that the ideas that you had or the plans or thoughts that you had, you don't, you don't have those.
And I am a person who believes in like letting, like, let your kid do the things that safely, like let them find the things that they're going to be passionate about, even if they're not your things.
But if you were hoping to live vicariously through them and the life that they are living is maybe not one that you're all that excited about living vicariously through, then maybe you should just start living vicariously through yourself. Yeah. Um, and finding hobbies.
And as I've gotten older and as I've thought about my health more, and as I've thought about like what I can do in spite of certain health problems and some other things like having a, having a hobby that doesn't involve a keyboard is really nice.
And it's helped me in this space where I'm just not doing things hardly at all anymore. Like me, me doing the programming stuff. Like I don't, I have hobby like projects and stuff, but I don't do nearly as much using a keyboard that I, that I used to.
Um, and that's great because that means I'm spending more time with family, even if it is me bugging them about like, oh, Hey, did you see that? This plant? I want it. Yeah. It's still hopefully making me a little bit more present. Um, and like around them versus kind of away from them.
Um, not just physically, but mentally. Um, so that's been the biggest one is me organizing things, me changing my, my office, uh, to, and all I did was I just rotated my desk like 90 degrees. And that has me looking directly out of a window. I'm getting more sunlight.
Um, again, having my plants around me, which means I'm probably breathing cleaner air, which is nice. Um, I've actually reduced the amount of stuff on my desk, which will lead me to the next thing that I did. And I think we talked about this in a pre-show or two. I got a new monitor.
Um, I got an Asus 20 or Asus 24 inch here. It's 34 inch, 34 inch curved, uh, monitor. Um, I picked, I think you can find them on Amazon. I think I linked to the one on Amazon, but you could, I also picked mine up from like micro center. Um, it was the overall idea.
And for those who are super conductors, y'all heard this ad nauseum. So just one more time. Um, I used to have two larger monitors. I had a 27 inch 5k and a 24 inch 4k. And what I noticed was I was not, there was like space in the, like on the 4k that was just never used.
Like I never looked over there. And then on top of that, sometimes I'd have my laptop open. So then I have like all this monitor space. And then like, I do like the idea of a reference monitor where you just have like a chat window open or something like that. Um, that's fine.
 But what I, what I really wanted was the ability to like, one, have a camera centered so that when I'm looking at my computer screen, it doesn't look like I'm looking off into the distance, uh, which was kind of an annoyance of just having two big monitors and sometimes having information on one screen and then other information on another screen.
Um, but I also wanted to feel like I was adequately using my space. One of the things that I have learned about myself and I think other people know this about themselves, but sometimes they don't admit it is that you will fill the space that you have. Yes.
So like, so having, having like a two bedroom, you know, apartment and going, I need a third bedroom. If you move to a three bedroom apartment, you're going to, you're going to be looking at that. It's going to be like, why is this full now? I need a fourth bedroom.
Um, where, where in reality, the two bedroom was fine. You just needed to go about removing things.
Um, so that's kind of what I have worked on doing in my office is as I've reduced my monitors, I've also looked at some of the apps that I'm using and just like so many apps in the, in the menu bar, so many other things.
Um, I switched over to Raycast, I think in the last systems check, I think we talked about that or maybe it was one before. I specifically mentioned that, like, I wasn't hoping to become a Raycast power user or any of that stuff. That's still very much the case.
Um, however, I have started replacing some of the apps that I was using with these like Raycast extensions, um, that are in the store. Um, and one of those is menu management or window management. So like having a, having a 34 inch monitor, the resolution on it is never perfect.
So what I've learned is it's sometimes better to have windows in thirds. So I just opened Raycast and I'll, and I'll just say it's either two thirds, left thirds, last third, um, left third, I think is also like, oh, it's not, it's sorry.
Two thirds, which is like the middle two thirds, the center two thirds. And then you have first two thirds or second tooth or last two thirds. Um, and that usually will create like a space, a good spacing that there is some overlap, but not too much of being able to move around.
And it's, you know, I, now I just, if I just do two, the options are all there. I just either go like last first, sometimes I'll just do first and it'll do first third. And let me guess first third or first two thirds. Um, but it's built in and that's nice.
It's like, I had to install the extension, but it's like, it wasn't like a super ridiculous thing. I just had to, I just had to go like window management and then add it. Um, some other things I've added were snippets. Uh, as I talked about in the pre-show, I stopped using text expander.
Um, mostly in that I felt like I was no longer getting the value that I was paying for it out of it. Um, and I don't, and not to say that I wasn't using it, but it was like the amount that I was using it was, becoming significantly less.
Um, like Kathy kind of mentioned with one password, sometimes you run into these instances where like text expander doesn't work and you have to delete a button. You have to close a bunch of apps to get it to work again. And I'm just like, Oh, I can't be bothered with that.
Um, so there, there was kind of like that problem. Um, and then the other one that I was looking at that I literally tried this for the first time today.
And that is because I don't know if you noticed Kathy, but Hank green did a thing and it confused people, not confused people, but I think it, I think it broke people's brains for a second, how popular it was.
Um, he created this bean, this bean app, and it's literally like these beans that like to knit, but they can't knit if you're using your phone to do other things. Um, I use something similar to this. There was like a tree timer. Yeah. I remember the tree one plant trees.
Um, and when I saw this, I was like, this is just the tree thing, except for they don't plant the trees. Um, I don't, I'm not here to, I haven't used Hank's app, so I don't, I don't know anything about it. Hank green seems to be like a genuine person.
Um, he's becoming more and more popular, which scares me. Cause it's always like, once they get really popular, that's when you turn out that they like slaughter baby goats or something. I mean, to be fair, he has been really, really popular for a while. Um, he, true.
And so, and part of what it was is, you know, when he went through cancer and now he has the, I forget what the sock company is, but like he donates all the profits to cancer research.
Um, and, uh, there's a lot, there's a lot like, yes, no person is perfect, but I think he ultimately has a lot of really good ideas.
I think he has a lot of great, again, this is not me trying to, this is me trying to set expectations, personal boundaries around people that I think are doing good things because it seems like every other person in my history that was doing amazing things turned out to be a horrible human being.
And I don't want that to happen. And I don't, and I have to like distance myself a little bit from like the, Oh, Hank green is doing all this amazing stuff. And I'm seeing a lot of stuff that he's doing. And I'm really happy. Like I've shopped at good store recently.
I have a subscription with good store. I get my soap from, from good store. Last year, I spent a bunch of money on like tea sets for everybody, like big fan supporter, but also I'm keeping a healthy, like I have, I have no more heroes. All my heroes are villains.
So I don't want to, I don't want to celebrate him long enough to find him the villain. Um, anyway, his app reminded me of the tree app.
And instead of going back and downloading the tree app, which has like zero use case on my laptop, I instead looked on Raycast and there is a focus timer that you could have that's built into Raycast where you can create focus sessions.
And in the focus sessions, you can say like, I don't want to open these apps. And if you do, it just kind of graze out your screen and says, Hey, you're not supposed to be doing this. And then it will like, you can override it if you want, or you can just go back and do what you were doing.
Um, I've have for a long time, not wanted to time track. And I still don't want to time track. This isn't meant for me to, to do time tracking things. What I like about this in many ways is I feel like this is a, a, a gentle reminder of, I need to get this thing done.
I'm going to focus on this thing for the next hour. And then I can go start focus session, this thing, only this stuff. And then from there I can just work. Um, and then when I'm done, I can turn it off and be like, good job. I did the thing. I focused.
Um, I think that's kind of what the tree app and what Hank's app is doing. Um, it's just another thing that Raycast has. Um, and then Raycast also has all these other integrations with a bunch of different tools and things and has like built in AI stuff. And I don't, I don't use half of this stuff.
Most of this stuff I don't use. It makes no sense for me that it's in there. Um, the thing that I'm worried about at this point is I am not a fan of the washer dryer combo. I'm not a fan of the microwave air fryer refrigerator combo.
Like I, I want my tools to ultimately do like one thing and one thing. Well, I had a moment where I was trying to figure out what you were saying, but I got it. I'm there. I I'm, I'm, I'm clocked in. Yeah. Like there are, I am okay having multiple tools that do the same thing.
If one of them is focused on doing the thing. And my concern is that with Raycast, I'm, I'm getting myself into a position to where if Raycast was like, Hey, you know what? We're going to increase our prices from $10 a month to $15 a month. And I was like, Oh, absolutely not.
Um, I'm not going to pay that. And I want to take, you know, I uninstall Raycast. And then I'm like, well, what? I'm not going to know how much I've relied on it until I've done that thing.
And I have been in that position before when I use, when I got rid of text expander, I was worried about that. Cause I was like, Oh no, how I've, how will I ever type my email in instead of just typing like email, like colon email, like get automatically apply.
Um, or how will I ever write this email thing? And it's like, you just, you just do, you just do the thing. And then once you've done the thing, then you don't think about it anymore because it's done that. I don't want Raycast to become my everything app. Yeah.
But I also want to get a healthier relationship with the apps that I do use. And I do actually want to reduce some of the apps that I've used.
So I do think, and this is me teasing my next connection is I will probably look at Raycast with some seriousness and say like, here's what I, here's what I want to use. Here's what I don't want to use. And then like, well, you know, maybe I'll add some more things. Maybe I'll remove some things.
Um, but that's kind of it there. Yeah. The last thing that I want to talk about is I have added a project management app into my life, um, specifically for black Python devs, uh, the nonprofit that I, I run.
Um, we have started using ClickUp and the reason that we selected ClickUp was ClickUp was the app that was flexible enough. Ultimately what we wanted to do is we wanted to have better process management of invoices and knowing like invoices that were pending invoices that were completed.
Cause we have to send our invoices to, um, our parent organization. And then they have to like verify that we have enough money to do the thing. And then they'll write, they actually process the invoice and do all the stuff and make the payment and then let us know that the payment was made.
Um, but meanwhile, we're having to keep in touch with people and go, Hey, we submitted your invoice to be processed. So like we're, we're working on it.
Um, and that usually came into the form of me either scrubbing through email, trying to find like links and notifications and confirmations, um, or me asking the person who is ultimately in charge of the project, Hey, where are we at on this?
Um, and that's just not a healthy, that's not, that's not a good plan.
Listen, I may not be a productivity guru. Oh wait, I am. Yes. Yes. Um, so the thing that ClickUp gave us that the other ones didn't was it wasn't something as loose as notion. Like it's very much like a project, like task management tool. Um, it has some cool relationship stuff.
It has some templating things, which is really nice. Like I have the ability to say, like, if I'm in this list, anything that's created has always has these notes, these things that are always needed and these subtasks that we always go through.
So like by default, no one has to go and say, well, I need to add the, like verify with J or whatever. It's, it's very much just like a new, new task. And then it has everything there. Um, there's that, but then there's also some other pieces.
Like we have this like donation amount thing that we're tracking and we try to have really good transparency on how much money we're spending and, and in what areas. And we had like three different places where we have that information being put and none of them were accurate.
So like having them in the app where we're like, yes, this person was approved for this much. I can now say, now let me see the chart of broken down by continent. Like where are we spending our money and the number of events that we've sponsored and all this stuff.
I can always go to a place that I know has to be accurate because we have like, everybody has to work in this space. Um, that's, that's been super helpful. Um, yeah, that's, that's me. That's a lot. I had a lot there.
I think some of my stuff is more like, I just need therapy more than anything, but yeah, that's, that's kind of where my system is at. Love it. I love it. I'm really, you know, I appreciate the system checks because it really, it does help me think.
Um, but also I can see where stuff is coming from the future and that makes me really happy, excited, yada, yada, yada. I agree. Well, Kathy, what are you doing in the next, uh, conduit? In the next fortnight, we are hitting September, um, which is exciting.
Um, and, uh, I have been kind of on this, like focusing on, like cleaning up my space. Um, I would like to tackle, um, my, maybe we'll, we'll do it small.
I would like to tackle some drawers in my kitchen that I know are full of trash, like not actual trash, but like there's a bunch of junk in there. Um, and so I would like to, we'll say two drawers. I would like to clean out two drawers and get rid of stuff that I no longer need.
Like lids for cups that we don't have anymore. They, we, I don't need them in the drawer. I like, I, I wish your, um, connection check was remove the lids for cups. That's the bare minimum lids with cups. Um, I said something about what my, oh yeah.
I'm going to have a healthy look at replacing apps with Raycast. Um, again, I don't necessarily want it to be my everything app.
I don't want to do everything with Raycast, but I do want to maybe have a little more again, like if I can reduce some of the stuff that I'm doing and just have like fewer things going on, I'm, I am really fighting overwhelm lately. And I just want, I want less choice at the moment.
And I think that would be great. Well, and, uh, speaking of overwhelm next week, is it? Yeah. Next week. I thought it was the end of September, but no, it's next week. Next week we will be doing another conduit. Um, that means we've only got one week to do our tasks.
I'm glad I minimized it as much as possible. Uh, so yeah, we, and maybe we can slip this at the beginning of this episode or next episode or something. Um, but next week, instead of a coworking, we'll be having another conduit.
Um, this cadence will track appropriately so that we're not missing multiple episodes. Like the scheduling for September is bananas. It always is. But this year specifically, it was out of control. And so we are switching our cadence. So starting next week, next week will be another conduit.
We are planning on not necessarily having connections because we know that it's going to be really short. Um, and so we'll probably end up not doing connections at all, uh, next week other than our own, um, just to help kind of fix that cadence. So that is kind of the heads up of what's going.
Also, I did not realize that, um, there's a whole other week in August. And, uh, when I made my bullet journal, I totally missed the last week of August. So, you know, that's how my life's going. That's okay. We just, just put it in the back. Like, yeah, exactly. Exactly.
We'll just put it partially in September. It'll be fine. It'll be fine. Yep. All right. And then our conductors, our soprano of the show, Debo says next connection again, two weeks from now, uh, men, my choir three weeks from now, three weeks from now. Yep. Yeah.
Our doll of the show, Molly says next connection, get a checklist of things I need to do with a car and get the DC fast charging fixed, get it inspected and get the tags. Yes. So excited. New car live. And let us know which, uh, in, in discord, which car you got. I want to know. Yep.
The, uh, of the show, uh, it says, uh, my room seems to have had another visit from the doom pile fairy. Um, I've got to tackle at least one of those piles this fortnight. Yeah. Do my laundry room has a doom pile. Those dang doom files, uh, our fish bear of the show. Fishy Kai new connection.
Make sure the kids are prepared for school. Yes. Good call. It's that time. Make sure, make sure the adults are prepared for school. Um, the Esperanto knitter of the show.
Iri Zanyo says, uh, move the remaining doom pile, more doom piles, uh, to the empty, the, uh, living room, the bedroom as much as possible and continue decluttering and sorting there. Moving it out of one room helps me to see the bedroom and office in a different light.
Um, the new smart lights also help there. Uh, I like that. Um, and build it back up as a calm and peaceful place. I'm also organizing the video game events. So spending some time on that and traveling in a couple of days, ah, of the show. Sounds like you've got a busy, busy time coming up.
Our robotics engineer of the show, Aiden says, next connection. I need to make a phone call that I've been putting off for a while. I just have to figure out how I'm going to deal with the language barrier. You know what? You can just do it.
It'll, it'll be awkward and uncomfortable, but once it's done, it's no longer weighing deeply on yourself. Yep. Our identical twin of the show, Aaron says more vacation stuff.
I'm going camping with my girlfriend in two weeks and I want to put together, uh, and I want to put a plan together for the things we will need over the next week and sort out the food after that. Oh, that, I mean, that sounds fun for you. Have fun camping. Nameless of the show.
Nameless says new connection. Read. I've been successful in having time to read, just not using that open time to, you know, read. Yep. Like, like space, time will be filled with everything unless you specifically use that time to read. So happy for you. Our chief swifty. Uh, nope.
Our Oracle of the show. Soph says, I really, really, really need to finish a paper that I've been avoiding writing because everything is a slog at the moment, but I need to do it now or I'll be working all the weekends. So I'm getting it done by next kind of it. Well, you even got an extra week.
Yeah. Um, that doesn't mean you should wait until the last minute, but that means that you got a little bit more time. Our chief swifty of the show. Andrew says new connection. I want to schedule my physical therapy.
I slept so wrong about a week ago that my shoulders and neck seized up badly enough that my 43 year old body needs physical therapy. This is going to give me the chance to learn how to better care for it. Ah, getting old. Joy. Getting old. We don't like it.
Um, and our shark of the show, Chris says connection for next time is to prepare for my mother-in-law's arrival this coming Saturday. Winter is coming and winter must be the name of your mother-in-law, I guess.
Uh, Mike, our checklist enthusiast of the show says new connection actually finished the planning process for my St. Jude campaign. Yeah. It's almost time. It's, it's, it's, it's about that time. It's practically September.
Um, uh, and our tech podcast listener of the show, the pillock says, huh, get St. Judea ready for September, which is coming up way too fast. Um, I feel like those two should just talk to each other about this and then they'll remind themselves repeatedly that it's coming.
If you would like to submit a connection, you can do so. Really? You can by visiting my connection, check.com. Um, include your name of the show and both your current and next connection and submit it via feedback.
If you're a discord or sorry, if you are a relay member, um, or a super conductor, you can go in the discord in the hashtag show follow-up channel. I haven't done this in a while. Why do I feel like I'm, I'm messing this up? Um, you can do this in the hashtag show follow-up channel.
Be sure to use the conduit emoji, um, and put in your connection there. Um, lastly, you can visit. I'm a super conductor to become one of those members today. You get access to the pre and post show banner and ad free episode and a coworking session in the off weeks with Kathy and Jay.
Uh, lastly, Hey, we got merch. If you want to support us with like a one-time donation type thing, why not buy some merch? Get you a shirt that says I'm a super conductor. Um, get another shirt that just says conduit. I can't do it. Um, I don't think we have that shirt. I don't think we do either.
Make that shirt and then give it to us and then buy it. That's great. We also have stickers. And socks and a baby onesie. Do we have socks? I don't think we have socks. Stop lying. Hey, green, make us some socks. Um, and last but not least, thank you to all of our super awesome superconductors.
Um, you are the sponsor of this week's episode. Hey, Kathy. Hey, Jay. We con did it. Good night. We con tuavec. Go on. Okay. Hold on. Hi, Kay. Hey, Jay. Follow on theこ? Okay. Bye. Groove. Go. I'mFrame. Go on. Let's do it. Sit down. Yeah. I'm Chris. Tiet about one. Yeah. And this man.
